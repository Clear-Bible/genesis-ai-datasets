                            A Psalm For The New Year

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 5, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
   Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen." 2 Peter 3:18.

   BEHOLD, Beloved, our perpetual dangers. Where can we go to escape from
   peril? Where shall we fly to avoid temptation? If we venture into
   business, worldliness is there. If we retire to our homes, trials are
   there. One would have imagined that in the green pastures of the Word
   of God there would have been perfect security for God's sheep. Surely
   no lion shall be there and no ravenous beast shall go up from there!
   Alas, it is not so. For even while we are reading the Bible we are
   still exposed to peril. Not that the Truth of God is dangerous, but
   that our corrupt hearts can find poison in the very flowers of
   Paradise.

   Mark what our Apostle says of the writings of St. Paul, "Wherein are
   some things which are hard to be understood." And mark the danger to
   which we are exposed, lest we, being unlearned and unstable, should
   wrest even the Word of God itself to our own destruction. With the
   Bible before our eyes, we may still commit sin--pondering over the
   hallowed Words of Inspiration we may receive a deadly wound from "the
   error of the wicked." Even at the horns of the altar we need that God
   should still cover us with the shadow of His wings. It is a very
   pleasing reflection that our gracious Father has provided a shield by
   which we may be sheltered from every ill and in our text the evil of
   heterodoxy finds a suitable preventative.

   We are in danger, lest misinterpreting Scripture we should make God say
   what He does not--and lest by departing from the teaching of the Holy
   Spirit we should wrest the letter of the Word and lose its spirit--and
   lest from the letter draw a meaning which may be for our soul's ruin.
   How shall we escape this? Peter, speaking by the Holy Spirit, has in
   the words before us, pointed out our safeguard. While we search the
   Scriptures and grow in acquaintance with them, see to it that we grow
   in Divine Grace. And while we desire to know the doctrine, long above
   all to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ--and
   let our study of Scripture and our growth in Divine Grace and in the
   knowledge of Christ still be subservient to that higher object--that we
   may live to bring glory both now and forever to Him who has loved us
   and bought us with His blood.

   Let your hearts say evermore, "Amen" to the doxology of praise, so
   shall you be kept from all pestilent errors and you shall not fall from
   your own steadfastness. It appears, then, that our text is adapted to
   be a heavenly remedy for certain diseases to which even students of
   Scripture are exposed. I am persuaded it may serve also as a most
   blessed directory to us through the whole of the coming year.

   I might divide my text, this morning, as good old Adams does. He says
   there are here two trumpets. One is blown from Heaven to earth--"Grow
   in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." The
   other sounds from earth to Heaven--"To Him be glory both now and
   forever." Or I might quote him again. He says here is first a point of
   theology, "Grow in grace." Secondly, a point of doxology, "To Him be
   glory both now and forever."

   We will take the text in the same natural divisions with other headings
   and notice, first, that we have here a Divine injunction, with a
   special direction. And secondly, a grateful doxology, with a suggestive
   conclusion.

   I. To begin, then, at the beginning, we have here first of all, A
   DIVINE INJUNCTION WITH A SPECIAL DIREC-TION--"Grow in grace and in the
   knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."

   "Grow in grace." What is this? It must be, in the outset, implied that
   we have been quickened by Divine Grace, otherwise this text cannot
   apply to us at all. Dead things cannot grow. Only those who are alive
   unto God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead have in them
   any power or capability of growth. The great Quickener must first
   implant the seeds of life, then afterwards those seeds can germinate
   and grow. To you, therefore, who are dead in trespasses and sins, this
   text has no application. You cannot grow in Divine Grace, because as
   yet you are under the curse of the Law and the wrath of God abides on
   you. Tremble, repent, believe--and may God have mercy on you!

   But being alive from the dead and quickened by the Spirit of God which
   is in you, Beloved Brethren, you who are born again are bid to grow,
   for growth shall prove your life. A post planted in the earth grows
   not--but a tree, rooted there, increases from a sapling to a forest
   king. Drop a pebble into the richest soil and it will be a pebble still
   of the same size, but put in there the grain or the seed, and it will
   spring up and produce its stalk and its flower. You who are alive unto
   God, see to it that you grow in all the Divine Graces.

   Grow in that root-grace, faith. Seek to believe the promises better
   than you have done. Go from that trembling faith which says, "Lord, I
   believe: help You my unbelief," upward to that which staggers not at
   the promise, but which, like Abraham, believes that He who has promised
   is able also to perform. Let your faith increase in extent, believing
   more, the Truths of God--let it increase in firmness, getting a tighter
   grip of every Truth. Let it increase in constancy, not being feeble or
   wavering, nor always tossed about with every wind. Let your faith daily
   increase in simplicity, resting more fully and more entirely and more
   completely upon the finished work of your Lord Jesus Christ.

   See to it that your love, also grows. If you have loved with a spark,
   pray that the spark may become an all-consuming flame. If you have
   brought little to Christ, pray that you may bring your all, and may
   offer that all in such a fashion, that like Mary's broken alabaster
   box, the King, Himself, may be satisfied with the perfume. Ask that
   your love may become more extended--that you may have love unto all the
   saints. And even more practical, that it may move your every thought,
   your every word and deed--make them more intense--that you may become
   as burning and shining lights whose flame is love to God and man.

   Pray that you may grow in hope, that "the eyes of your understanding
   being enlightened, you may know what is the hope of His calling and
   what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints." Pray
   that you may be looking for that blessed hope, the glorious appearing
   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. That the hope not seen as yet may
   enable you with patience to wait for it. Pray that you may, by hope,
   enter into the joys of Heaven while you are on earth. Pray that hope
   may give you immortality while you are yet mortal--may give you
   resurrection before you die--may give you to see God, while as yet the
   glass darkly parts you from Him.

   Ask that you may grow in humility till you can say, "I am less than the
   least of all the saints." That you may grow in consecration till you
   can cry, "For me to live is Christ: to die is gain." Pray that you may
   grow in contentment till you can feel, "In whatever state I am, I have
   learned to be content." Pray to advance in likeness to the Lord Jesus,
   that your very enemies may take knowledge of you, that you have been
   with Jesus and have learned of Him. Finally, if there is any virtue, if
   there is any praise, if there is anything that is lovely and of good
   repute, if there is anything that can increase your usefulness, that
   can add to your happiness, that can make you more serviceable to man
   and more glorious towards God--pray to grow in it--for you have not yet
   attained, neither are you yet already perfect.

   Following up an illustration furnished by the Holy Scriptures, let me
   remind you all, you faithful Believers in Christ, that you are compared
   to trees--trees of the Lord's right hand planting. Seek to grow as the
   tree grows. Pray that this year you may grow downward. That you may
   know more of your own vileness, more of your own nothing-ness--and so
   be rooted in humility. Pray that your roots may penetrate below the
   mere topsoil of the Truth of God, into the great rocks which underlie
   the uppermost stratum. Pray that you may get a good hold of the
   doctrines of eternal love, of immutable faithfulness, of complete
   satisfaction, of union to Christ, of the eternal purpose of God, which
   He purposed in Christ Jesus before the world was.

   These deep things of God will yield a rich and abundant sap and your
   roots shall drink from the hidden fountains of "the depth which lies
   under." This will be a growth which will not add to your fame, which
   will not minister to your vanity--but it will be invaluable in the hour
   of storm, a growth the value of which no heart can conceive when the
   hurricane is tearing up the hypocrite and hurling into the sea of
   destruction the "trees whose fruit withers, without fruit, twice dead,
   plucked up by the roots."

   As you root downward, seek to grow upward. Send out the top shoot of
   your love towards Heaven. As the trees send out their spring shoots and
   their midsummer shoots, and as you see upon the top of the fir that new
   green child of spring--the fresh shoot which lifts its hand towards the
   sun--so pant to have more love and greater desires after God.

   Seek a nearer approach towards Him in prayer, a sweeter spirit of
   adoption, a more intense and intimate fellowship with the Father and
   with His son Jesus Christ. This mounting upwards will add to your
   beauty and to your delight.

   Then pray to grow on either side. Stretch out your branches. Let the
   shadow of your holy influence extend as far as God has given you
   opportunities. But see to it, also, that you grow in fruitfulness, for
   to increase the bough without adding to the fruit is to diminish the
   beauty of the tree. Labor this year, by God's Grace, to bring forth
   more fruit unto Him than you have ever done. Lord, give to this
   congregation more of the fruits of penitence for sin, of faith in the
   great sacrifice, of love to Jesus, of zeal for the conversion of souls.
   We would not be as the gleanings of the vintage when there is only here
   and there a cluster upon the uppermost bough, we would be as the valley
   of Eshcol, whose presses burst with new wine. This is to grow in Divine
   Grace--to root downward, to shoot upward, to extend your influences
   like far-reaching branches--and to bring forth fruit unto the Lord's
   glory.

   But we will borrow another figure from Scripture. Brothers and Sisters
   in Jesus Christ, we are not only compared to trees but to children. Let
   us grow as babes do, nourished by unadulterated milk--steadily,
   slowly--but surely and certainly. Little each day but much in years. Oh
   that we may grow as a child does in strength, till the little tottering
   limbs of our faith shall be firm muscular legs with which the young man
   may run without weariness, and feet upon which the strong man may walk
   without fainting. As yet our wings are immature and we can hardly leave
   the nest.

   Lord, bid our growth proceed till we can mount as with the wings of
   eagles towards Yourself, surmounting clouds and storms and dwelling in
   the serene Presence of the Most High. Let us grow in the development of
   all our powers. Let us ask that we may be no more little infants of a
   span long but that many cubits may be added to our stature till we
   ripen to perfect men in Christ Jesus. And let us specially pray that we
   may grow as healthy children, uniformly.

   Brothers and Sisters, it is an ill sign if a child's head enlarges but
   not the rest of his body, or if its arm or foot should be swollen to an
   ill proportion. Beauty consists in the proportion of every part. A
   vigorous judgment should not be yoked with a cold heart, nor a clear
   eye with a withered hand. A giant's head rides ill on a dwarf's
   shoulders. A virtue nourished at the expense of others is a fattened
   cannibal fed upon the flesh and blood of its murdered kinsmen. And it
   ill becomes a Christian to harbor such a monster. Let us pray that
   faith and love and every Divine Grace may be developed--that not one
   power of the man may be left unnurtured or ungrown--for only thus can
   we truly grow in Divine Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ.

   But do you inquire why we should thus grow in Divine Grace? Let us say,
   Brethren, that if we do not advance in Divine Grace it is a sorrowful
   sign. It is a mark of sickness. It is an unhealthy child that grows
   not, a cankered tree that sends forth no fresh shoots. More--it may not
   only be a sign of unhealthiness but of deformity. If a man's shoulders
   have come to a certain breadth and his lower limbs refuse to lift him
   aloft, we call him a dwarf, and we look upon him with some degree of
   pity. He is ill-formed. O Lord, let us grow, for we would not be
   abortions, we would not be deformities. We would be children like unto
   God our Father--we would be comely ones, everyone of us like the sons
   of a king.

   Not to grow may be, moreover, the sign of death. It may say to us,
   Inasmuch as you grow not, you live not. Inasmuch as you do not increase
   in faith and love and Divine Grace--and inasmuch as you do not ripen
   towards the harvest--fear and tremble lest you should only have a name
   to live and be destitute of life. Fear, lest you should be the painted
   counter-feit--a lovely picture drawn by the painter's skillful hand,
   but without reality, without the life-power which should make it bud
   and germinate and blossom and bring forth fruit.

   Advance in Divine Grace, because not to progress foretells many evil
   things and may result in that worst of all things--the want of
   spiritual life. Grow in Grace, because, Beloved, to increase in Grace
   is the only pathway to enduring nobility. Oh, do you not wish to stand
   with that noble host who have served their Master well and have entered
   into their eternal rest? Who among you does not wish to have his name
   written with the missionaries of modern times--with Judson and with
   Carey, with Williams and with Moffat? Who among us is there who has no
   ambition to find his name written among those servants of
   God--Whitfield, Grimshaw, Newton, Romaine, Toplady and others who
   preached the Word with power?

   Are there any of us who wish to go back to the vile dust from where we
   sprung, "unwept, unhonored, and unsung?" Then let us be as we are. Let
   us cease our march. Meanness lies at your door--be stunted and be
   ignoble. But if we would be princes in God's Israel, if we would be
   mighty warriors for the Cross of Christ, let us pray this prayer,
   "Lord, bid us grow in Your Grace, that we may be faithful servants and
   receive Your commendation at the last."

   But, my Brothers and Sisters, to grow is not only to be noble, it is to
   be happy. That man who stops growing, refuses to be blessed. With most
   men in business, if they do not win, they lose. With the warrior, if he
   gains not in the battle, his enemy is getting an advantage. That wise
   man who gets no wiser, grows more foolish. That Christian who does not
   know more of his Lord and become more like He, knows less of his Lord
   and becomes less like He. Our armor, if unused, will tarnish, and our
   arms, if not strengthened by effort, will be weakened by indolence. Our
   happiness declines as our spirituality fades.

   To be happy, I say, we must go forward. Forward is the sunlight!
   Forward is victory! Forward is Heaven! Forward is Christ! But here, to
   stand still is danger--no, it is death. O Lord, for our happiness' sake
   bid us advance, and for our usefulness' sake let us ascend. Oh, if we
   as a congregation and as a Church grew more in Grace--if we were
   stronger in faith, mightier in prayer, more fervent in heart, more holy
   in life--who can tell how much we might effect our age? Men who walk
   but lightly, leave but faint steps. But men who tread with the tramp of
   Roman soldiers stamp their footprints on the sands of time, never to be
   erased. So let us live that in our day, and in after days the world may
   be the better and Christ's Church the more prosperous for our having
   lived. For this reason, if for no other, let us grow in Divine Grace.

   Oh, could I fire you with some hallowed ambition today I would be but
   too happy! Could I snatch from some ancient altar a live coal such as
   that which fell upon the lip of Isaiah, I would say unto you, Lo, this
   has touched your lip--go forth in the Spirit and power of God, even the
   Most High--and live as they lived who counted not their lives dear unto
   them that they might serve their Master and be found in Him. I point
   you to the spirits who have entered within the veil and who rest upon
   the couches of eternal glory, and I say, they won the victory by Divine
   Grace--and growth in Divine Grace was the means of their triumph.
   Emulate them! Press forward as they did and through Grace you shall
   inherit their rest and their triumph and sit down with them forever.

   But do you inquire how you shall grow in Divine Grace? The answer is
   simple. He who gave you Grace must give you more of it. Where you first
   received your Grace, there you must receive the increase of that Divine
   Grace. He who made the cattle and who created man, was the same who
   afterwards said, "Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth." So
   He that has given you Grace must speak with the fiat of His omnipotence
   in your heart and say to that Grace, "Be fruitful and multiply and
   replenish the soul till its native emptiness shall be filled, and the
   natural wilderness shall rejoice and blossom like a rose."

   But at the same time we would have you use the means. And those means
   are much prayer, a more diligent search of the sacred Scriptures, a
   more constant fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ--greater activity
   in His cause, an earnest attendance upon the means of Grace--a devout
   reception of all revealed Truths of God, and so forth. If you do these
   things you shall never be stunted or dwarfed, for He that has given you
   life will thus enable you to fulfill the word which He spoke to you by
   His Apostle, "Grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior
   Jesus Christ."

   I have thus explained the Divine exhortation. But you perceive it
   contains a special injunction, upon which we must pause a moment. "And
   in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."

   My Beloved Brethren in the Lord Jesus, we must see to it that we ripen
   in the knowledge of Him. Oh, that this year we may know more of Him in
   His Divine nature and in His human relationship to us in His finished
   work, in His death, in His resurrection, in His present glorious
   intercession and in His future royal advent! To know more of Christ in
   His work is, I think, a blessed means of enabling us to work more for
   Christ.

   We must study to know more of Christ also in His Character--in that
   Divine compound of every perfection, faith, zeal and deference to His
   Father's will--in His courage, meekness, and love. He was the lion of
   the tribe of Judah and yet the Man upon whom the Dove descended in the
   waters of Baptism. Let us thirst to know Him of whom even His enemies
   said, "Never man spoke like this Man," and His unrighteous judge said,
   "I find no fault in Him."

   Above all, let us long to know Christ in His Person. This year endeavor
   to make a better acquaintance with the Crucified One. Study His hands
   and His feet. Abide hard by the Cross and let the sponge, the vinegar
   and the nails be subjects of your devout attention. This year seek to
   penetrate into His very heart and to search those deep far-reaching
   caverns of His unknown love--that love which can never find a rival and
   can never know a parallel. If you can add to this a knowledge of His
   sufferings, you will do well.

   Oh, if you can grow in the knowledge of fellowship--if you shall this
   year drink of His cup and be baptized with His Baptism--if you shall
   this year abide in Him and He in you--blessed shall you be! This is the
   only growth in Divine Grace which is true growth. And all other growth
   which leads us not to increase in the knowledge of Christ is but the
   puffing up of the flesh--not the building up of the Spirit. Grow in the
   knowledge of Christ, then, my Brothers and Sisters.

   And do you ask me why? Oh, if you have ever known Him you will not ask
   that question. He that longs not to know more of Christ, knows nothing
   of Him yet. He that ever sipped this wine will thirst for more, for
   although Christ does satisfy, yet it is such a satisfaction, that we
   want to taste more and more and more and more. Oh, if you know the love
   of Jesus, I am sure as the hart pants for the water brooks, so will you
   pant after Him. If you say you do not desire to know Him better, then I
   tell you, you love Him not, for love always cries, "Nearer, nearer,
   nearer."

   Absence from Christ is Hell. But presence with Christ is Heaven. And,
   as we get nearer to Him, our Heaven becomes more heavenly and we enjoy
   it more and feel more that it is of God. Oh, may you, this year, come
   to the very well of Bethlehem and not merely receive a vessel from it,
   as David did, at the risk of the lives of three mighty men--but may you
   come to the well and drink--drink from the well itself, from that
   bottomless well-spring of eternal love. Oh, this year may the secret of
   the Lord be with you and may you be in the secret place of the Most
   High!

   My Master, should You permit me to ask You one thing as a special
   favor, it should be this--that I may "know Him and the power of His
   resurrection, being made conformable to His death!" Nearer to You,
   blessed Lord, nearer to You--this is all our cry shall be. The Lord
   grant that our cry may be heard, that we may grow in the knowledge of
   Christ! We wish to know Christ this year as our Lord--Lord of every
   thought and every desire, of every word and every act. And as our
   Savior, too--our Savior from every indwelling sin, our Savior from
   every evil past, from every trial to come.

   All hail, Jesus! We salute You as Lord. Teach us to feel Your Kingship
   over us and to feel it every hour. All hail You, crucified One! We
   acknowledge You as Savior. Help us to rejoice in Your salvation and to
   feel the plenitude of that salvation in all and every part of spirit,
   soul and body, being wholly saved by You.

   I have thus, Brothers and Sisters, sought to expound the point of
   theology. I lift up my heart in prayer for you all that you may grow in
   Divine Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

   II. In the second place, we have A GRATEFUL THANKSGIVING WITH A MOST
   SUGGESTIVE TERMINA-

   TION--"To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen."

   The Apostles, we must remark, very frequently suspended their writing
   in order to lift up their hearts in praise. Praise is never out of
   season and it is no interruption to interrupt any engagement in order
   to laud and magnify our God. "To Him be glory." Brethren, do not let me
   preach now but let me interpret your emotions. Let it be not so much my
   utterance, as your utterance by my lips. Let every heart joyously feel
   this doxology, To Him, the God that made the heavens and the earth,
   without whom was not anything made. To Him who in His infinite
   compassion became the Surety of the Covenant--to Him who became a babe
   of a span long.

   To Him who was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and
   acquainted with grief--to Him who on the bloody tree poured out His
   heart's life that He might redeem His people--to HIM who said, "I
   thirst," and, "It is finished!"--to Him whose lifeless body slumbered
   in the grave--to Him be glory! To him that burst the bonds of death--
   to Him who ascended on high and led captivity captive--to Him who sits
   at the right hand of the Father and who shall soon come to be our
   Judge--"to Him be glory."

   Yes, to Him, you atheists, who deny Him--to Him, you Socinians, who
   doubt His Deity--to Him, you kings, who vaunt your splendor and will
   not have this Man to reign over you--to Him, you people, who against
   Him stand up, and you rulers who against Him take counsel--to Him, the
   King whom God has set upon His holy hill of Zion--to Him be glory! To
   Him be glory as the Lord--King of kings and lords. "Wonderful,
   Counselors, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of
   Peace." And yet again Hosanna in the highest--Hallelujah, King of kings
   and Lord of lords! To Him be glory as LORD! To Him be glory as SAVIOR!

   He alone has redeemed us unto God by His blood. He alone has "trod the
   winepress," and "comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah,
   glorious in His apparel, traveling in the greatness of His strength."
   "To Him be glory." Hear it, you angels--"To Him be glory." Clap your
   wings. Cry "Hallelujah, to Him be glory." Hear it you spirits of the
   just made perfect--sweep the strings of your celestial harps and say,
   "Hallelujah, glory to Him who has redeemed us unto God by His own
   blood." "To HIM be glory." Church of God respond! Let every pious heart
   say "To HIM be glory." Yes, unto Him be glory, you Fiends of Hell, as
   you tremble at His Presence and see the key of your prison swinging at
   His girdle. Let Heaven and earth and Hell--let things that are, and
   were, and shall be, cry, "To Him be glory."

   But the Apostle adds, "now"--"to Him be glory, now." O Brethren,
   postpone not the day of His triumph! Put not off the hour of His
   coronation. Now, NOW--

   "Bring forth the royal diadem, And crown Him Lord of all."

   Now, now. For now, today, "He has raised us up together and made us sit
   in heavenly places with Christ Jesus." Beloved, now are we the sons of
   God--"now are our sins forgiven. Now are we robed in His righteousness!
   Now are our feet upon a Rock and our goings are established. Who is
   there among you that would defer the time of your hosannas? "To Him be
   glory now." O cherubim above, "To Him be glory now!" For you
   "continually do cry, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts." Adore Him
   yet again, for, "To Him be glory now."

   "And forever." Never shall we cease our praise. Time! You shall grow
   old and die. Eternity! Your unnumbered years shall speed their
   everlasting course. But forever, forever, forever, "to Him be glory."
   Is He not a "Priest forever, after the order of Melchisedek"? "To Him
   be glory." Is He not king forever?--King of kings and Lord of lords,
   the everlasting Father? "To Him be glory forever." Never shall His
   praises cease. That which was bought with blood deserves to last while
   immortality endures. The glory of the Cross must never be eclipsed. The
   luster of the grave and of the resurrection must never be dimmed.

   Oh, my beloved Brothers and Sisters, my spirit begins to feel the ardor
   of the immortals. I would anticipate the songs of Heaven. My tongue,
   had it but celestial liberty, would begin even now to join those
   thrice-melodious sonnets sung by flaming tongues above. O Jesus! You
   shall be praised forever! As long as immortal spirits live--as long as
   the Father's Throne endures--forever, forever, forever, unto You shall
   be glory!

   But now, there is a conclusion to this of the most suggestive kind,
   "Amen." Brethren, I want to work this amen out--not as a matter of
   doctrine, but as a matter of blessed transport. Come, give me your
   hearts again. "To Him be glory both now and forever, Amen." What does
   this Amen mean? Amen has four meanings in Scripture. By the way, the
   Puritan's remark--it is a very remarkable thing--that under the old
   Law, there was no amen to the blessings. The only amen was to the
   curses. When they pronounced the curses, "All the people said Amen."

   Under the Law there never was an amen to the blessing. Now, it is an
   equally remarkable and more blessed thing, that under the Gospel, there
   is no amen to the curses, the only amen is to the blessings. "May the
   grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God our Father and the
   communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all, Amen." "If any man loves
   not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha." No amen.
   There is no amen to the curse under the Gospel. But "all the promises
   of God are yes and amen, in Christ Jesus."

   Now, the "Amen"--and here I am greatly indebted to good old Thomas
   Adams--means four things. First, it is the desire of the heart,
   "Behold, I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus." We say amen
   at the end of the prayer, to signify, "Lord, let it be so"--it is our
   heart's desire. Now, Brethren, give me your hearts, then--for it is all
   a heart-matter here. "To Him be glory both now and forever, Amen." Is
   that your heart's desire? If not, you cannot say amen to it. Does your
   heart long, pant, thirst, groan and cry out after Christ, so that you
   can say, every time you bend your knee, "Your kingdom come, Your will
   be done on earth as it is in Heaven, for Yours is the kingdom, the
   power and the glory, forever and ever, Amen"?

   Can you say, "Amen, Lord, let Your kingdom come"? Brethren, if you can
   say it in this sense, if it is your heart's desire that Christ's glory
   should be extended and His kingdom should come, say "Amen," aloud this
   morning. Now join with me, for my heart glows with it. I can say
   it--and the Judge of All knows how my heart longs to see Jesus
   magnified. Join with me then, you who can do it honestly, while I
   repeat the doxology--"To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen." [The
   congregation very heartily, aloud, said, "Amen."]

   So be it Lord. You hear Your Church as it cries "Amen!" Verily, it is
   our heart's desire--

   "Amen, with joy Divine, let earth's Unnumbered myriads cry; Amen, with
   joy Divine, let Heaven's
   Unnumbered choirs reply."

   But it signifies more than this. It means the affirmation of our faith.
   We only say amen to that which we really believe to be true. We add our
   affidavit, as it were, to God's promise, that we believe Him to be
   faithful and true.

   Have you any doubts but that Jesus Christ is glorious now and forever?
   Do you doubt His being glorified of angels, cherubim and seraphim,
   today? And do you not believe, my Brethren, that they that dwell in the
   wilderness shall bow before Him and that His enemies shall lick the
   dust? If you so believe, if you have faith today amid the world's
   obstinacy and the sinner's pride, amid abounding superstition and
   dominant evil--if you have faith still to believe that Christ shall be
   glorious forever and ever, then join with me and again say Amen. "To
   Him be glory both now and forever, Amen." [The congregation again said
   "Amen."]

   Lord, You hear it, though it is a feebler cry than aforetime, for there
   are more who can desire it than there are who believe it. Nevertheless,
   You abide faithful--

   "This little seed from Hea ven
   Shall soon become a tree;
   This ever-blessed lea ven
   Diffused abroad must be--
   Till God the Son shall come again,
   It must go on. Amen! Amen."

   But there is yet a third meaning to this amen. It often expresses the
   joy of the heart. When of old they brought forth a Jewish king, the
   high priest took a horn of oil and poured it on his head. Then came
   forward a herald, and the moment he had sounded the trumpet, one with a
   loud voice said, "God save the king! God save the king!" and all the
   people said, "Amen." And one shout went up to Heaven, while with joy of
   heart they saluted the king in whom they hoped to see a prosperous
   ruler through whom God would bless them and make them victorious.

   Now, what do you say? As you see King Jesus sitting upon Mount Zion
   with death and Hell beneath His feet. As today you anticipate the glory
   of His Advent. As today you are expecting the time when you shall reign
   with Him forever and ever, does not your heart say, "Amen"? I can
   remember, in a season of the greatest darkness of mind and weakness of
   body, there was one text which used to cheer me beyond all measure.
   There was nothing in the text about myself. It was no promise to me but
   it was something about Him. It was this--"Him has God highly exalted
   and given Him a name which is above every name, that at the name of
   Jesus every knee should bow, of things in Heaven and things in earth
   and things under the earth."

   Oh, it seemed so joyous that He was exalted. What did it matter what
   became of me? What did it signify what should become of all of us? King
   David is worth ten thousand of us. Let our names perish but let His
   name last forever. Brothers and Sisters, this morning I bring forth the
   King to you. I bring Him before the eyes of your faith today. I
   proclaim Him king, again, and do you, if you desire Him to be king, and
   if you rejoice in His reign, say "Amen"? Here, here He stands in vision
   before your eyes. Crown Him! Crown Him! Lo, He is today crowned afresh.
   "To Him be glory both now and forever." Joyous hearts lift up your
   voices and with one accord say "Amen." [The congregation again said
   "Amen."] Amen, Lord, be You King in the midst of us all--

   "Yes, amen, let all adore You,
   High on Your exalted Throne!
   Savior, take Your power and glory;
   Claim the kingdoms for Your own--
   O come quickly! Hallelujah, Come, Lord, come." But, lastly and this is
   a very solemn point. Amen is sometimes used in Scripture as an amen of
   resolution. It means, "I, in the name of God, solemnly pledge myself
   that in His strength I will seek to make it so. To Him be glory both
   now and forever." Now I shall not want you to say, "Amen" to this
   aloud, but I shall pause to let you say it silently in your own souls
   by-and-by.
   I walked last week through the long galleries which vanity has
   dedicated to all the glories of France. You pass through room after
   room where especially you see the triumphs of Napoleon in writhing
   bodies and in the blood and vapor and smoke. Surely as you walk through
   the pages of Scripture, you walk through a much more marvelous picture
   gallery, in which you see the glories of Christ. This Book contains the
   memorials of His honors. In another place in Paris there stands a
   column made with the cannons taken by the Emperor in battle. A mighty
   trophy, certainly. O Jesus! You have a better than this--a trophy made
   of forgiven souls--of eyes which wept but whose tears have been wiped
   away-- of broken hearts that have been healed and of saved souls that
   forever more rejoice!
   What trophies Christ has to make Him glorious, both now and
   forever--trophies of living hearts that love Him-- trophies of immortal
   spirits who find their Heaven in gazing upon His beauties! What must
   the glories of Christ be forever when you and I and all the ten
   thousand millions He has bought with His blood shall be in Heaven. Oh,
   when we have been there many a thousand years we shall feel as fresh a
   rapture as when we came there! And if our spirits should be sent on any
   errand from our Master, and we should have to leave His Presence for a
   moment, oh, with what wings of a dove we will fly back to behold His
   face again!
   When we shall all surround that Throne, what songs will I, the chief of
   sinners, saved by blood, give Him! What hymns will you give Him, you
   who have had your iniquities cleansed and are today saved? What praise
   will all those multitudes give Him who have all been partakers of His
   Grace? But this has more to do with "forever." Now, what do you say
   about our glorifying Him now? Oh, Brothers and Sisters, make it your
   prayer this morning, "Lord, help me to glorify You. I am poor, help me
   to glorify You by contentment. I am sick, help me to give You honor by
   patience. I have talents, help me to extol You by spending them for
   You. I have time, Lord, help me to redeem it, that I may serve You.
   "I have a heart to feel, Lord, let that heart feel no love but Yours
   and glow with no flame, but affection for You. I have a head to think,
   Lord help me to think of You and for You. You have put me in this world
   for something, Lord, show me what that is, and help me to work out my
   life-purpose. For I do desire to say amen. I cannot do much--my amen is
   but a feeble one--but as the widow put in her two mites, which made a
   farthing, which was all her living, so, Lord, I put my time and
   eternity, too, into Your treasury. It is all yours, take it, and thus I
   say, 'Amen' to Peter's doxol- ogy."

   And now, throughout this year will you go forth, my Brothers and
   Sisters, and say amen to this? I pray you do so. You who do not love
   Christ cannot say amen. Remember you are under the Law. There is an
   amen to all the curses for you. There is none to the blessings while
   you are under the Law. O poor Sinner under the Law, may this be the day
   when your slavery to the Law shall come to an end! "How can it be?" you
   say. By faith in Christ, I answer. "He that believes on Him is not
   condemned." Oh that you may believe on Him, and then your joyful heart
   will say amen!

   Then will you say, "Loudest of all the saints in Heaven, I will shout
   amen, when I see the royal crown brought forth and Jesus is
   acknowledged Lord of all." May God grant that this year may be the best
   year this Church has ever had. This year concludes eight years of my
   ministry among you and seven years of Printed Sermons are now before
   the public. How much of blessedness God has caused to pass through our
   mind and how much He has been pleased to own His Word, we cannot fully
   measure. But we know that He has been with us in deed and in truth.

   Now that we begin this year, may the Lord make it so that all the past
   shall seem to be as nothing compared with that which is to come. I
   bless you my Brothers and Sisters in the name of the Lord, and
   commencing this year, I beg again for renewed tokens of your affection
   by a renewal of your prayers. And on my part, I only trust that it may
   be mine through this year and as long as I live, to be giving my amen
   to that doxology--"To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen."

                                A Cure For Care

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 12, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Casting all your care upon Him. For He cares for you." 1 Peter 5:7.
   No one precept contains the whole of a Believer's duty. But usually in
   Scripture the precepts rise one above the other, like those stone steps
   by which the traveler in Egypt ascends to the pinnacle of the pyramid.
   You must first plant your feet firmly upon the preceding duty, before
   you shall be able fully to climb to the next command.
   Let me, then, call your attention to the precept which precedes my
   text--"Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that
   He may exalt you in due time." You know, Beloved, that there are some
   selfish, carnal cares which we must not cast upon God. It were an
   insult to Him. It were an act of infamy on our part if we should
   venture to ask for His assistance in them. Those are cares which would
   never molest us at all if we were obedient to the precept-- "Humble
   yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God."

   This cuts off the head at once of many of those anxieties into which
   Christians sometimes fall. For instance, covetous cares--if I desire to
   get and grasp more than is absolutely necessary, that I may hastily
   grow rich, I cannot, on my knees, ask God to carry this care for me,
   because it is none of His sending. He has taught me to say, "Give us
   this day our daily bread," and He has given me a blessed example in
   Agur, that I may pray, "Give me neither poverty nor riches." But I
   cannot go on my knees before God, honestly, as a miser and ask that He
   would enable me to add house to house and field to field. That care I
   never ought to indulge and I never should endure it if I attended to
   the precept, "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of
   God."

   There is, also, the care of ambition, when men desire to attain honors,
   eminence and fame. To stand foremost, to be exalted upon the pinnacle,
   to be looked up to by all and to be almost adored by some. But if we
   allow ambition to creep into our minds, we cannot go to God with it. It
   is a care which we dare not cast on God, for that were to empty the
   filth of our house upon the altar of God's sanctuary. But then, I say,
   it is a care which would never fret us, if our souls were lowly before
   the Lord.

   There are those cares, too, which we make for ourselves--those
   anxieties which anticipate the future--those foolish fears which are
   only created in our brain and which vex the head and then fret the
   heart. We cannot ask God to take those upon Himself--cares which have
   no existence except in our own fancies--we can scarcely cast on God.
   For, Beloved, we should never have them if we "humbled ourselves under
   the mighty hand of God." Then, in such a state of subjection to the
   Divine will and of resignation to the eternal purpose, our soul would
   sit quietly and be still--and our spirit would not agitate itself with
   frivolities which it has itself imagined, with fancies which have no
   origin but in our own imagination.

   Oh that you may have Divine Grace to obey the preceding command, and
   then I think, without any limitation, I may address you in the words of
   the text--"Casting all your care upon Him. For He cares for you." I
   repeat, sinful cares we cannot cast on God. But then, obeying the
   precept, "Humble yourselves," would uproot such vexations. He that is
   down, need fear no fall. He whose soul is even as a weaned child will
   fret and cry no more.

   In addressing you this morning from so rich a text as this, I would
   pray rather that the Holy Spirit may deliver you from anxiety, than
   attempt to deliver you from it myself, for I am not even able to obey
   this precept myself, much less shall I enable you to do it. Only when
   the Spirit of God is upon the preacher can he cast his cares upon his
   God and he is convinced by experience, that only as the Holy Spirit
   shall enable you, will you be able to do the same.

   However, that our word may be the means of your comfort and of your
   strengthening, let us speak on this wise. First, for a few minutes, let
   us expound this disease of care, giving some description of it.
   Secondly, let us manifest the blessed remedy of the text, endeavoring,
   in God's name, to apply it. And lastly, let us hold out the sweet
   inducement of the second part of the sentence, in order that Believers
   may be led to attempt the practicing of the precept, "He cares for
   you."

   I. First, then, LET US ENDEAVOR TO DESCRIBE THE DISEASE OF CARE. The
   care mentioned in the text, even though it is exercised upon legitimate
   objects, (and in this it differs from the cares of which I spoke just
   now, which were cares concerning wrong objects)--care, even when
   exercised upon legitimate objects if carried to excess, has in itself
   the nature of sin. This will be clear if you think for a moment that
   anything which is a transgression of God's command is sin, and if there
   were no other command, the one in our text being broken would involve
   us in iniquity.

   But it is a precept earnestly repeated by our Savior many times. It is
   one which the Apostles have reiterated again and again, and one which
   cannot be neglected without involving transgression. Besides, the very
   essence of anxious care is the imagining that we are wiser than God and
   the thrusting of ourselves into His place, to do for Him that which we
   dream He either cannot or will not do. We attempt to think of that
   which we fancy He will forget. Or we labor to take upon ourselves that
   burden which He either is not able or willing to carry for us.

   Now, this impertinence, this presumption--what if I say, this
   audacity--has in it the very nature of sin, to attempt to know better
   than God, to snatch from His hand the helm by which He guides affairs,
   to attempt to correct His charts, to re-map His Providence. This,
   indeed, is such an impertinence that as the guardian Scripture pushes
   back the intruder, it demands of him, "Are you also one of the King's
   counsel? What are you doing here? He took no counsel with you when He
   made the heavens and the earth and balanced the clouds and stretched
   out the skies like a tent to dwell in, how dare you come here and offer
   advice to perfect Wisdom and aid to Omnipotent Strength?" There is in
   anxious care the very nature of sin.

   But, further, these anxious cares very frequently lead to other sins,
   sometimes to overt acts of transgression. The tradesman who is not able
   to leave his business with God, may be tempted to indulge in the tricks
   of the trade. No, he may not only be tempted but he may be prevailed
   upon to put out an unholy hand with which to help himself. The
   professional or literary man, if he has no firm trust in Providence,
   may lend his skill to indirect and unlawful ends. And each man, if he
   has no other snare, will be tried with this--to forsake prayer and to
   forget the promise in order to trust to the wisdom of a friend, or to
   the natural sagacity of some mentor in whom he puts confidence.

   Now this is forsaking the fountain to go to the broken cisterns--a
   crime which was laid against Israel of old--a wrath provoking iniquity.
   Even if it led to no other act except this sin of preferring the
   counsel of man to the direction of God, excessive anxiety were to be
   reprobated and detested. But think, my Brethren, of the many sins which
   our anxieties engender in our hearts--unbelief which makes us doubt our
   God. Want of love which is proven by our distrust of love. Want of hope
   which puts out our eyes so that we cannot see the clear shining after
   the rain.

   Think, my Brothers and Sisters, how we fret and mistrust and thus vex
   the Spirit of God and often cause Him to depart from us, so that our
   prayers are hindered, so that our example is marred, so that we give
   ourselves rather to self-seeking than to seeking God. All these things
   are sins, the grapes of Gomorrah which grow on the vines of our cares.
   These base-born cares are the plentiful mothers of transgressions.
   Distrust is the egg out of which many a mischief is hatched. We indulge
   in these cares and think, surely we are doing no wrong--whereas the
   indulgence in them is in itself a crime--and is besides a tempter which
   guides us onward to the commission of other iniquities. The man that
   full of care, is ripe for any sin--but he who has cast his care on God
   stands securely--neither shall the Evil One be able to touch him.

   To proceed further in uncovering this disease--as it is in itself sin
   and the mother of sin, we note again that it brings misery. Where sin
   is, sorrow shall soon follow. He who would have his spirit bowed down
   even to the very earth, has only to fix his thoughts upon himself and
   his circumstances, instead of looking to God and His promises. Some of
   you are placed in a very happy position in life but, my dear Brethren,
   you can make yourselves miserable if you please. Others of you are put
   in what the world considers unhappy circumstances--but if God enables
   you--you can be supremely blessed.

   Poverty does not necessarily involve sorrow, nor do riches in
   themselves bring peace or happiness. If any of you wish for misery you
   need not go out of your own house--there is no need to travel far for
   causes of discontent. You can be surfeited with plenty and be poor. You
   can dwell in the midst of peace and be disturbed. You can possess the
   richest prosperity and yet be afflicted. We, to a very great extent
   make our own position. God ordains Providence and either

   Divine Grace makes us happy, or sin racks us with pain. God does not
   make our misery. The cause of our trouble lies at our own door, not at
   His.

   Do you see that Christian, there with the sparkling eyes and the light
   footsteps--the man who is swift to run upon his Master's errands? That
   man has many troubles but when he wakes in the morning, if he retains
   remembrance of them, he bows his knee and leaves them with his God. He
   goes home and the day has had much of sorrow in it, but he shakes the
   weight from his own shoulder and leaves his burden upon God. That man,
   with all his troubles, is more blessed than yonder professor. He is the
   one who has very little to vex him except that he vexes himself, by
   making every little thing a ground for fretfulness, magnifying every
   small mischance into a strange calamity and by losing all patience,
   when all things suit not his proud will and dainty taste.

   Oh Brethren! It is an ill thing for Christians to be sad. Let them
   rejoice, "Rejoice in the Lord always," but they never can, so long as
   they indulge in anxious cares.

   Besides this, these anxious cares do not only lead us into sin and
   destroy our peace of mind but they also weaken us for usefulness. When
   one has left all his cares at home, how well he can work for his
   Master! But when those cares tease us in the pulpit, it is hard
   preaching the Gospel. When cares buzz in the ear, the music of Divine
   Grace is hard to hear. What would you say of your workman who should
   come to you in the morning with a heavy piece of family furniture upon
   his back? He calls himself your porter, he is about to carry your goods
   and you see him going out of the door with your load, which is properly
   proportioned to his strength--but beside that he is carrying a heavy
   piece of his own upon his shoulders.

   You say to him, "My good man, what are you doing there?" "Oh Sir, I am
   only loaded with household stuff." I think you would say, "Well but you
   are not fit to do my work which you are engaged to do. I do not employ
   you to carry your own load, I had you here to carry mine." "But Sir,"
   says he, "I am so weak, I cannot carry both." "Then leave yours alone,"
   you say, "and carry mine."

   Or to use another simile. There was a great king who once employed a
   merchant in his service as an ambassador to foreign courts. Now the
   merchant, before he went away, said to the king, "My own business
   requires all my care and though I am always willing to be Your
   Majesty's servant, yet if I attend to your business as I ought, I am
   sure my own will be ruined." "Well," said the king, "you take care of
   my business and I will take care of yours. Use your best endeavors and
   I will answer for it that you shall be nothing the loser for the zeal
   which you take from yourself to give to me."

   And so our God says to us, as His servants, "Do My work and I will do
   yours. Serve Me and I will serve you." Like Peter--Peter is fishing,
   Christ needs a pulpit to preach in. He borrows Peter's boat and
   preaches in it. What about Peter's fishing? Oh, the Master will take
   care of that, for no sooner is the sermon done than He says, Launch
   into the deep and let down your nets for a catch." And Peter gets more
   in ten minutes through having lent his boat to his Master, than he
   might have done in ten weeks, if he had been fishing on his own
   account. Leave your cares with God and care for

   Him--

   "Make HIS service your delight, Your wants shall be HIS care."

   The subject would not be complete if I did not add that these little
   cares, of whose guilt, perhaps, we think so little, do very great
   damage to our blessed and holy cause. Your sad and miserable
   countenances hinder souls who are anxious, and they present a ready
   excuse for souls who are careless. "Look," they say, "look, that man is
   a Christian man, the whole of the winters of a century have left their
   storm rifts on his forehead, and all the winds of ages seem to have
   ruffled his brow. He has no peace, no joy--who would be a Christian to
   be so miserable?"

   Thus the careless man says he will not have Hell here, he will leave
   that for hereafter. Even anxious spirits say, "It cannot be that this
   religion is true, for if it were really true, one would think it would
   be able to support its followers in the troubles of life. If God's Word
   is true, that God will sustain His people. Then Christians would be
   sustained and Believers would be cheered and comforted. But I see that
   they are as much fretful as other men, as impatient as they are and
   that So-and-So, who makes a profession, is quite as weak, quite as
   easily bowed before the storm as yonder man who has no God in whom to
   trust and no promises on which to lean."

   Ah, let it not be said so, Christian, through you. Open not the enemy's
   mouth to blaspheme! Let not the dragon find food through you, who are
   of the seed of the Woman, but rather seek, casting your care on God, to
   disentangle yourself of all personal hindrances that you may be avenged
   upon your Master's adversaries as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

   I close the description of this matter by saying that in the most
   frightful manner, cares have brought many to the poisoned cup, the
   halter, and the knife, and hundreds to the madhouse. What makes the
   constant increase of our lunatic asylums? Why is it that in almost
   every country in England new asylums have to be erected, wing after
   wing being added to these buildings in which the imbecile and the
   raving are confined? It is because we will carry what we have no
   business to carry--our own cares. And until there shall be a general
   keeping of the Day of Rest throughout England, and until there shall be
   a more general resting of our souls and all we have upon God, we must
   expect to hear of increasing suicides and increasing lunacies.

   So long as the present system of competition in business shall
   continue--and there seems no hope that it will ever cease--the signs of
   the times suggest that the battle will grow sterner every day. It will
   become a more stern duty with each of us to cast our care on God,
   unless we would see reason reel and would be howling maniacs in our
   cells. Oh, for your own sake, and for your children's sake, for
   Christ's sake and for His Church's sake, I pray you spoil not the fair
   house which God has built! Cast not out the lovely tenant, leave not
   the temple of the Lord to be the prison of madness. Away with evil
   cares if you would still be a man.

   II. I shall now want your attention to the second part of the subject,
   THE BLESSED REMEDY TO BE APPLIED.

   Somebody must carry these cares. If I cannot do it myself, can I find
   any who will? My Father who is in Heaven stands waiting to be my
   burden-bearer. With broad shoulders, with omnipotence as His strength,
   He says "My child, roll your burden upon your God." Blessed privilege,
   dare I neglect it? Can I be wicked enough to reject it and to bear my
   cares myself? Here is the blessed remedy, "Cast your burden upon the
   Lord and He will sustain you."

   Now in order, rather to apply this remedy, than to describe it, by the
   help of God's Holy Spirit I will mention some of those fears, those
   cares, which are legitimate enough in their objects but which can only
   be relieved by leaving them with God. One of the first and most natural
   cares with which we are vexed is the care for daily bread. "I should be
   content," says one, "with food and raiment. If I can but provide things
   honest in the sight of all men and see my family cared for, I shall
   then be happy." "But" says one, "what shall I eat, what shall I drink,
   with what shall I be clothed?

   "I am without a job, having, therefore, no opportunity to earn my
   livelihood. I am without substance, having, therefore, nothing to look
   upon by which I may be supported without labor. I am without friends or
   a patron who might give me his generous assistance. What shall I do?"
   You are a Christian, are you? You must use all diligence, that is your
   duty--but oh, if God shall help you, mingle no fretfulness with the
   diligence, no impatience with your suffering, and no distrust with your
   trials. No--remember what Jesus has said so sweetly to the point,
   "Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap,
   nor gather into barns. Yet your Heavenly Father feeds them.

   "Are you not much better than they? Which of you by taking thought can
   add one cubit unto his stature? And why take you thought for raiment?
   Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither
   do they spin: and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in his glory was
   not arrayed like one of these. Why, if God so clothes the grass of the
   field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not
   much more clothe you, O you of little faith? Therefore, take no
   thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With
   what shall we be clothed? (for after all, these things do the Gentiles
   seek): for your Heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these
   things. But seek you first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.
   And all these things shall be added unto you."

   Such a care as that, I say, is natural enough--and to bid a man shake
   it off when he is in actual need--is cruelly absurd, unless you have a
   sure consolation to offer him. But you can say, "Cast your trial upon
   God." Use your most earnest endeavors, humble yourself under the mighty
   hand of God. If you cannot do one thing, do another. If you cannot earn
   your bread as a gentleman, earn it as a poor man. If you cannot earn it
   by the sweat of your brains do it by the sweat of your brow. Do
   something for an honest living--sweep a crossing if you cannot do
   anything else. If a man will not work, neither let him eat. But having
   brought yourself to that, if still every door is shut, "Trust in the
   Lord and do good, so shall you dwell in the land and verily you shall
   be fed."

   Business men, who have not exactly to hunt for the necessities of life,
   are often tormented with the anxieties of large transactions and
   extended commerce. The failures of others, frequent bad debts, changes
   in the markets, monetary pres- sures, and sudden panics, cause a world
   of trouble. Through our fashion of credit in this age, it is very hard
   for a Christian to conduct business in the sober, substantial fashion
   which a tender conscience would prefer. "Owe no man anything"--if that
   could be interwoven into the system of trade, it would, I do not doubt,
   cure tens of thousands of ills which now grow out of that credit system
   which seems to be unavoidable, but which, I am sure, involves many of
   the crimes which are committed and very much of the care which racks
   business men.

   Well, through the present high-pressure system of trade there is
   naturally much care. If any man here can say that he can go into his
   office having many in his employ and never at all have care, I should
   think he must be a rarity in the world. Surely he might walk till he
   dropped with weariness before he would meet with another of the same
   order. But if there is a Brother here who has a business so extensive
   that he does not sleep at night. One that lies there tossing on his
   bed, thinking about this servant who may have robbed him, or about that
   vessel that is out at sea, or about the low prices of a certain article
   which has gone down since he laid in a large stock and all those little
   things which all of you know.

   Then I say, "Brother, wait a minute! What are you doing? What are you
   doing? Are you sure that in this you have used your best prudence and
   wisdom, and your best industry and given it your best attention?"
   "Yes." Well then, what more have you to do? Suppose you like to weep
   all night? Will that keep your ship from going on the Goodwin sands?
   Suppose you could cry your eyes out? Will that make a thief honest?
   Suppose you could fret yourself till you could not eat? Would that
   raise the price of goods?

   One would think if you were just to say, "Well, I have done all that is
   to be done, now I will leave it with God," that you might go about your
   business and have the full use of your senses to attend to it. Whereas
   now you fritter away your senses and then commit blunders, and so you
   multiply your troubles by that very fretfulness by which you hoped to
   remove them. There--let them alone! We say, "Leave well enough alone."
   But I say, "Leave ill alone," leave them both alone and with both your
   hands. For you will want both hands to honor your Master--with the hand
   of prayer, "In everything by prayer and supplication, making known your
   wants unto God." And with the other hand, the hand of faith, trusting
   in God--lift your load right off from your own shoulders and let the
   whole crushing weight be left with your eternal God, for "He will
   sustain you, He will never suffer the righteous to be moved."

   Another anxiety of a personal kind which is very natural, and indeed,
   very proper if it is not carried to excess, is the care of your
   children. Blessed be God for our children! We do not sympathize with
   those who look upon them as afflictions, for we believe them still to
   be a heritage of the Lord. But what anxieties they involve! How shall
   we bring them up? How shall they be provided for? Will they honor their
   parents, or will they bring disgrace upon the name they bear? A child
   may be the greatest curse his parents ever had, while he may be their
   choicest comfort. "All these," as an old Puritan said, "are doubtful
   blessings and may be certain curses, yet I will not have it that there
   is any doubt about their being blessings, as God sends them."

   A Christian parent must have care about his children and all the more
   because he is a Christian, since he will not be satisfied with their
   getting on in business, he will never be content till his children walk
   in the Truth of God. Mother, Father, you have prayed for your children.
   You trust you have set them a holy example. You labor day by day to
   teach them the Truth as it is in Jesus. You have travailed in birth for
   their souls till Christ is formed in them. It is well. Now let your
   souls quietly expect the blessing--leave your offspring with God--cast
   your sons and daughters upon their father's God. Let no impatience
   intrude if they are not converted in your time. Let no distrust
   distract your mind if they should seem to belie your hopes.

   I met yesterday with a few verses which sound like the warbling of an
   American song writer. They exactly suit my subject and in reading them
   in private they have touched my heart. Excuse me therefore, if though I
   never read a sermon, I should for once read a part of one--

   "The Master has come over Jordan,"

   Said Hannah, the mother, one day.

   "He is healing the people who throng Him,
   With a touch of His finger, they say.
   And now I shall carry the children,
   Little Rachel and Samuel and John
   I shall carry the baby, Esther,
   For the Lord to look upon."

   The father looked at her kindly, But he shook his head and smiled--
   "Now, who but a doting mother Would think of a thing so wild? If the
   children were tortured by demons, Or dying of fever it were well. Or
   had they the taint of the leper, Like many in Israel."

   "No, do not hinder me, Nathan. I feel such a burden of care If I carry
   it to the Master, Perhaps I shall leave it there. If He lays His hand
   on the children, My heart will be lighter, I know-- For a blessing
   forever and ever

   Will follow them as they go."

   So, over the hils of Judah,

   Along by the vine-rows green,

   With Esther asleep on her bosom,

   And Rachel her brothers between

   Among the people who hung on His teaching,

   Or waited His touch and His word,

   Through the ro w of proud Pharisees listening,

   She pressed to the feet of the Lord.

   Now, why should you hinder the Master, Said Peter, "with children like
   these? See not how, from morning till evening, He teaches and heals
   disease?" Then Christ said, "Forbid not the children, Permit them to
   come unto Me!"

   And He took in His arms little Esther, And Rachel He set on His knee.
   And the hea vy heart of the mother

   Was lifted all earth-care above, As He laid His hands on the brothers
   And blessed them with most tender love. As He said of the babes in His
   bosom,

   "Of such are the kingdom of Heaven."

   And strength for all duty and trial

   That hour to her spirit was given.

   Thus do you and thus inherit the blessing.

   But each Christian will in his time have personal troubles of a higher
   order, namely, spiritual cares. He is begotten again unto a lively hope
   but he fears that his faith will yet die. He hopes he has some spark of
   spiritual joy, but there are dark and dreary nights which lower over
   him and he fears that his lamp will die out in darkness. As yet he has
   been victorious but he trembles lest he should one day fall by the hand
   of the enemy.

   Beloved, I beseech you--cast this care upon God for He cares for you.
   "I am persuaded that He that has begun a good work in you will carry it
   on and perfect it unto the day of Christ." He has said, "I will never
   leave you, nor forsake you." "The mountains shall depart and the hills
   be removed. But My kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall
   the Covenant of My peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy on
   you." "When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. And
   through the rivers, they shall not overflow you: when you walk through
   the fire, you shall not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon
   you." "No good thing will I withhold from them that walk uprightly." "I
   give unto My sheep eternal life and they shall never perish, neither
   shall any man pluck them out of My hand."

   Why, one might keep you all this morning and this afternoon and evening
   too, repeating the precious promises of God and we might close them all
   by saying--

   What more can He say than to you He has said, You who unto Jesus for
   refuge have fled?"

   Away, then with dark suspicions and anxieties! Is it care about past
   sin? "The blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleans us from all
   sin." Is it present temptation? "There has no temptation happened to
   you but such as is common to men: but God who is faithful, who will not
   suffer you to be tempted above what you are able. But will with the
   temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it."

   Is it future peril? O leave that with Him, for neither "things present,
   nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature,
   shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ
   Jesus our Lord." If you begin to think always of yourself, you will be
   miserable. Why, it is Christ that makes you what you are before the
   eyes of God. Look, then, to Jesus in order to find out what you are in
   God's esteem. Soul, I say again, look at Christ and not at yourself.
   Never let anxieties about sanctification destroy your confidence of
   justification.

   What if you are a sinner! Christ died to save sinners. What if you are
   undeserving! "In due time Christ died for the ungodly." Divine Grace is
   free. The invitation is still open to you--rest the whole burden of
   your soul's salvation where it must rest. Do not be an Uzza--lay no
   hasty hand upon the ark of the Lord. Above all, do not be an
   Uzziah--attempt not to offer sacrifices or usurp the priesthood, for
   Christ must stand for you--you cannot stand or do for yourself. Cast,
   then, your care on Him, for He cares for you.

   I shall want your patient attention two or three minutes more, while
   trying to apply this remedy. I notice that there are many cares not of
   a personal, but rather of an ecclesiastical character, which often
   insinuate themselves and plead for life, but which must nevertheless be
   put away. I am sorry to confess, that if I do not preach to anyone else
   this morning, I shall now be preaching to myself. There are cares about
   how God's work is to be carried on. I know a foolish young man who lies
   awake many nights thinking about that, and who sometimes by day makes
   himself foolishly sad, because with large purposes of heart and with
   great designs in his soul, he sees not the way by which they are to be
   carried out and has not yet attained the faith which--

   "Laughs at impossibilities, And says, 'It shall be done.'"

   If any of you are suffering from the same sad disease, let me exhort
   you from the words of Peter, to cast the care about God's work upon
   God. He never sent us a warfare at our own charge. He never did require
   us to do His work-- that He will attend to Himself. And we ought to
   feel that if God does not enable us to do as much as we would, it is a
   blessed thing to be enabled and permitted to do as much as we can. If
   we think there are few men to work, or little means with which to work,
   we must not be fretful about where the means, or the men shall come
   from. We may properly pray, "Lord, send laborers," and with equal
   propriety we may ask that He who has the silver and the gold, may give
   them for His own work.

   But after that, we must cast our care on God. Then, if we get over
   that, there will be another anxiety--one which frets me often
   enough--the success of God's work. Oh, when there are souls converted,
   how our heart leaps for joy. When the Church keeps continually
   increasing, how glad we are! But if there is even a little lull, we
   feel so sad. If we do not see God's arm always bare, we are ready to
   lie down and say, "Lord, let me die, I am no better than my fathers."
   When we are in a low state of body and heart, too, that weakening
   sickness of unbelief, like the woman's issue of blood, comes over us
   and we feel that life is ebbing as success decreases. Now, this is a
   care we must cast on God.

   Preacher, your Great Employer sent you out to sow the seed--but if no
   grain of it should ever come up--if you sowed the seed as He told you
   and where He told you, He will never lay the blame of a defective
   harvest to you. It is ours to preach--but to convert souls is God's. It
   is ours to labor--but the success depends alone on Him. "They that go
   through the valley of Baca make it a well"--that is their business, to
   dig wells. "The rain also fills the pools"--it is not their business to
   fill the wells. And the wells do not get full from the bottom as they
   do in our country--it is the rain that fills the pools. The blessing
   comes from on High--if we have dug the wells and we have prayed six
   times and as yet the rain has not descended, go again seven times and
   the rain shall yet descend and the pools shall be filled to the brim.
   Do not, therefore, let us have cares about success.

   And sometimes there is another care. It is the care lest some little
   slip made by ourselves or others should give cause to the enemy to
   blaspheme. There are devils besides those in Hell--there are some on
   earth. And some of these are too glad to find an opportunity, if there
   is a word that is ever so fitly spoken, to wrest it out of its
   connection and make stock and capital for blasphemy out of it. It is an
   easy task and one which any fool can accomplish--this world is full of
   fools who are glad to find dirt to eat, and then having eaten it
   themselves, to cram it down others throats.

   One is sometimes afraid to walk for fear of breaking something in such
   a frail world as this. Afraid to speak, lest we should say something
   which might open the enemy's mouth. A careful jealousy is very well if
   it leads to caution--but very ill if it leads to a worrisome, weak
   anxiety. What have you and I to do with what the enemy may do? If the
   Lord does not chain the devil, I am sure we cannot. And if He does not
   shut the mouths of liars, I do not know that we ought to wish He would,
   for if He lets them open their mouths I have no doubt they are best
   open.

   Many a time, as Christ rode into Jerusalem on the back of an ass, the
   truth has ridden into the midst of Jerusalem in triumph on the back of
   its most despicable enemies. Beyond doubt, Christ has been lifted up
   even on the point of the spear and the light of the Gospel has beamed
   like a beacon from the stake where the martyr perished. Well, let us
   leave our enemies to do what they will and only stand fast to the Lord
   and cast our care on Him.

   And then, one is so afraid of being unfaithful at the last, lest the
   blood of souls should be on our garments. Oh, that thought has dashed
   me on my forehead on the floor many and many a time. This heavy burden
   crushes me into the most pitiable state, until the body sympathizes
   with the mind so fully, that if you could see me with the tears running
   from my eyes and the cold sweat starting from my head, you would say,
   "What a creature is that to go forth and preach?" The thought of having
   all of you to address and that I must be faithful, or else your blood
   shall be required at my hands, is so awful a one that in private I
   never dare to think of it, for it utterly unmans me.

   But oh, blessed be God, if He has enabled us to do all we can by His
   Spirit, we must leave it there. We know that He will not ask more of us
   than He has given to us and if He has helped us so far, His shall be
   the glory. But if we have failed, even that, too, shall be washed away
   through His precious blood and with all his weight of responsibility
   the minister shall yet enter Heaven and find a place among the
   sanctified.

   III. My last point and only a word, of THE SWEET INDUCEMENTS TO
   CONVINCE YOU TO LEAVE YOUR BURDENS WITH HIM--"He cares for you."

   Believe in an universal Providence, the Lord cares for ants and angels,
   for worms and for worlds. He cares for cherubim and for sparrows, for
   seraphim and for insects. Cast your care on Him, He that calls the
   stars by their names and leads them out by numbers, by their hosts. Why
   do you say, O Jacob, and think, O Israel, "my way is passed over from
   God and He has utterly forgotten me?" Let His universal Providence
   cheer you.

   Think next of His particular Providence over all the saints. "Precious
   shall their blood be in His sight." "Precious in the sight of the Lord
   is the death of His saints." "We know that all things work together for
   good to them that love God, to them that are the called according to
   His purpose." Let the fact that while He is the Savior of all men, He
   is specially the Savior of them that believe. Let that cheer and
   comfort you, that special Providence which watches over the chosen,
   "The angel of the Lord encamps round about them that fear Him."

   And then, thirdly, let the thought of His special love to you be the
   very essence of your comfort. "I will never leave you, nor forsake
   you." God says that as much to you, as He said it to any saint of old.
   "Fear not, I am your shield and your exceeding great reward." Oh, I
   wish, Beloved, that the Holy Spirit would make you feel the promise as
   being spoken to you! Out of this vast assembly, forget the rest, and
   only think of yourself, for the promises are unto you, meant for YOU.
   Oh, grasp them. It is ill to get into a way of reading Scripture for
   the whole Church--read it for yourselves and specially hear the Master
   say to YOU this morning, "Let not your heart be troubled, you believe
   in God, believe also in Me."

   Think that you hear Him say, "I have prayed for you that your faith
   fail not." Think you see Him walking on the waters of your trouble, for
   He is there, and He is saying, "Fear not, it is I, be not afraid." Oh,
   those sweet words of Christ! Lord, speak them to me! Speak them to Your
   poor sorrowing child yonder! Speak them to each one of us! Speak them
   to us, and let us hear Your voice and say, "Jesus whispers consolation,
   I cannot refuse it, I will sit under His shadow with great delight."

   Sinners--ungodly persons here--you know not God. I send you away when I
   have said this one thing. What a blessed thing it is to be a Christian,
   to have Someone who will take your cares for you! Why, you know you
   will have your cares whether you are Christians or not--you are sure to
   have troubles even in the world--but then you have no Christ to comfort
   you, no God to sustain you, no promise to cheer you. You have the
   darkness without the lamp, you have to die without the immortality to
   follow. Oh that you knew what a Christian is, and your mouths would be
   watering to know the Christian's privilege!

   I say to you, cast your sins upon Christ. Jesus Christ can take them.
   If you believe on Him there is proof that He did take them of old, did
   carry them and suffered for them in His own Person that you might go
   free. Oh may we each this morning, saint and sinner, come to the Cross
   and to the Throne of Grace and say, "Lord, unload us of our burdens of
   guilt and care and give us now to go on our way rejoicing," because
   God, all-sufficient, has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake
   you."
     __________________________________________________________________

                        Grace Exalted--Boasting Excluded

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 19, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but
   by the law of faith."

   Romans 3:27.

   PRIDE is most obnoxious to God. As a sin, His holiness hates it. As a
   treason, His sovereignty detests it. As a rebellion, the whole of His
   attributes stand leagued to put it down. God has touched other sins
   with His finger, but against this vice He has made bare His arm. There
   have been, I know, terrible judgments against lust--but there have been
   ten times as many against that swelling lust of the deceitful heart.
   Remember, the first transgression had in its essence, pride.

   The ambitious heart of Eve desired to be as God, knowing good and evil,
   and Adam imagined that he should be lifted up to Divine rank if he
   dared to pluck and eat. The blasting of Paradise, the sterility of the
   world, the travail of human birth, the sweat of the brow, and the
   certainty of death may all be traced to this fruitful mother of
   mischief, pride.

   Remember Babel and how God has scattered us and confounded our tongues.
   It was man's pride which led him to seek for an undivided monarchy that
   so he might be great. The tower was to be the rallying point of all the
   tribes and would have been the central throne of all human
   grandeur--but God has scattered us--that pride might not climb to so
   high a pitch. Pride, you have indeed suffered severe strokes from God.
   Against you has He furbished His sword and prepared His weapons of war.

   The Lord, even the Lord of Hosts has sworn it, and He will surely stain
   the pride of all human glory and tread all boasting as straw is trod
   for the dunghill. Talk no more so exceedingly proud. Let no arrogance
   come out of your mouth, for the bows of the mighty have been broken and
   the haughtiness of man has been bowed down. Remember Pharaoh and the
   plagues which God brought on Egypt, and the wonders which He worked in
   the field of Zoan.

   Remember the Red Sea, and Rahab cut, and the dragon broken. Think of
   Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty architect of Babylon, driven out to eat
   grass like the oxen till his nails grew like birds' claws and his hair
   like eagles' feathers. Remember Herod, eaten of worms, because he gave
   not God the glory. And Sennacherib, with the Lord's hook in his jaws,
   turned by the way he came to the place where his sons became his
   slayers.

   Time would fail to tell of the innumerable conquerors, and emperors,
   and mighty men of earth who have all perished beneath the blast of Your
   rebuke, O God, because they lifted up themselves and said, "I am, and
   there is none beside me." You have turned wise men backward and made
   their knowledge foolishness and no flesh may glory in Your Presence.

   Yes, when pride has sought to shelter itself in the hearts of God's
   chosen people, still the arrows of God have sought it out and have
   drunk its blood. God loves His servants still, but pride even in them,
   He abhors. David may be a man after God's own heart--but if his pride
   shall lift him up to number the people, then he shall have a choice
   between three chastisements. And he shall be happy to choose the
   pestilence as being the least of the plagues.

   Or if Hezekiah shall show to the ambassadors of Babylon his riches and
   his treasures, there shall come to him the rebuke--"What have they seen
   in your house?" And the threat--"Behold they shall take your sons to
   make them eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon." Oh, Brethren,
   forget not that God has uttered the most solemn words as well as issued
   the most awful judgments against pride. "Pride goes before destruction
   and a haughty spirit before a fall." "Him that has a high look and a
   proud heart will I not suffer." "Pride and arrogance do I hate."

   "The Lord will destroy the house of the proud." "The day of the Lord
   shall be upon everyone that is proud and lofty, and upon everyone that
   is lifted up, and he shall be brought low." "I am against you, O you
   most proud, says the Lord God of Hosts." There are hundreds of terrible
   texts like these but we cannot now recount them all.

   Now mark, to put an everlasting stigma upon human vanity and to hurl
   once and for all mire and filth upon all human glorying, God has
   ordained that the only way in which He will save men shall be a way
   which utterly excludes the possibility of man's having a single word to
   say by way of vaunting. He has declared that the only foundation which
   He will ever lay shall be one by which man's strength shall be broken
   in pieces and by which man's pride shall be humbled in the dust.

   To this subject I ask your attention this morning. It is to enlarge and
   amplify the sentiment of the text that I seek. "Where is boasting,
   then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of
   faith."

   We shall notice first of all, the rejected plan of Law. Then we shall
   note the excluded vice. Having so done, we shall notice in the third
   place, that the very fact that boasting is excluded permits of the
   reception of the worst of sinners. And we shall close by observing that
   the same system which excludes boasting includes humble and devout
   gratitude to God for His Grace and mercy.

   I. First, then, THE REJECTED PLAN. There are two ways by which man
   might have been forever blessed. The one was by works--"This do and you
   shall live. Be obedient and receive the reward; keep the commandment
   and the blessing shall be yours, well earned and surely paid." The only
   other plan was--"Receive Grace and blessedness as the free gift of God;
   stand as a guilty sinner having no merit, and as a rebellious sinner
   deserving the very reverse of goodness--but stand there--and receive
   all your good things, simply, wholly and alone of the free love and
   sovereign mercy of God."

   Now, the Lord has not chosen the system of works. The word Law, as used
   twice in the text, is employed, it is believed by many commentators,
   out of compliment to the Jews, who were so fond of the word, that their
   antagonism might not be aroused. But it means here, as elsewhere in
   Scripture, plan, system, method. There were two plans, two systems, two
   methods, two spirits--the plan of works and the plan of Divine Grace.
   God has once and for all utterly refused the plan of merit and of works
   and has chosen to bless men only and entirely through the plan, or
   method, or law of faith.

   Now, Brethren, we have put the two before you, and we beg you to mark
   that there is a distinction between the two, which must never be
   forgotten. Martin Luther says--"If you can rightly distinguish between
   works and Grace, thank God for your skill and consider yourself to be
   an able Divine." This, indeed, is the bottom of theology and he who can
   understand this clearly, it seems to me, can never be very heterodox.
   Orthodoxy must surely follow and the right teaching of God must be
   understood when we once and for all are able to discriminate with
   accuracy between that which is of man--works--and that which is of
   God--faith--and Divine Grace received by faith.

   Now, the plan of salvation by works is impossible for us. Even if God
   had ordained it to be the way by which men should labor to be saved, it
   is certain that none would have been saved by it, and therefore, all
   must have perished. For if you would be saved by works, remember O Man,
   that the Law requires of you perfection. One single flaw, one offense
   and the Law condemns you without mercy. It requires that you should
   keep it in every point and in every sense and to its uttermost
   degree--for its demands are rigorous in the extreme.

   It knows nothing of freely forgiving because you can not pay--but like
   a severe creditor, it takes you by your throat and says, "Pay me all."
   And if you cannot pay even to the uttermost farthing, it shuts you up
   in the prison of condemnation, out of which you can not come. But if it
   were possible for you to keep the Law in its perfection outwardly, yet,
   remember that you would be required to keep it in your heart as well as
   in your external life.

   One single motion of the heart from the right, one reception of even
   the shadow of a passing temptation, so as to become a partaker of sin,
   would ruin you. "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
   and with all your mind, and with all your soul, and with all your
   strength and your neighbor as yourself." Fail here and oh, who among us
   can be such a hypocrite as to think he has not failed ten thousand
   times--fail here--and though your life were virtuous, though your
   exterior were such as even criticism itself must commend, you still
   perish because you have not kept the Law and yielded its full demands.

   Remember, too, that it is clear you can never be saved by the Law,
   because if up to this moment your heart and life have been altogether
   without offense, yet it is required that it should be so even to your
   dying day. And do you hope that as temptations come upon you thick as
   your moments, as your trials invade you numerous as the swarms which
   once thronged from the gates of Thebes, you will be able to stand
   against all these? Will there not be found some joint in your harness?
   Will there not be some moment in which you may be tripped up--some
   instant when either the eye may wander after lust, or the heart set on
   vanity?

   Can you say you would never stretch out your hand to touch that which
   is not good? Oh, Man, remember, we are not sure that even this life
   would end that probation, for as long as you should live and be God's
   creature, duty would still be due and the Law still your insatiable
   creditor. Forever would your happiness tremble in the scales. Even in
   Heaven itself the Law would follow you. Even there, as your
   righteousness would be your own, it would never be finished. And even
   from yonder shining battlements you might fall and amid those harps,
   wearing that white robe, if you were to be saved by your own works,
   there might be a possibility of perishing!

   The obedience of a creature can never be finished. The duty of a
   servant of the Law is never over. So long as you were the creature of
   God, your Creator would have demands upon you. How much better to be
   accepted in the Beloved and to wear His finished righteousness as our
   glory and security! Now in the face of all this, will any of you prefer
   to be saved by your works? Or, rather, will you prefer to be damned by
   your works? For that will certainly be the issue, let you hope what you
   may.

   Now I suppose that in this congregation we have but very few--there may
   be some--who would indulge a hope of being saved by the Law in itself.
   But there is a delusion abroad that perhaps God will modify the Law, or
   that at least He will accept a sincere obedience even if it is
   imperfect. That He will say, "Well, this man has done what he could
   and, therefore, I will take what he has given as though it were
   perfect."

   Now, remember, against this the Apostle Paul declares peremptorily, "By
   the works of the Law shall no flesh living be justified," so that that
   is answered at once. But more than this, God's Law cannot alter, it can
   never be content to take less from you than it demands. What said
   Christ? "It is easier for Heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of
   the Law to fail." And again, He expressly said, "Think not that I am
   come to destroy the Law, or the Prophets. I am not come to destroy but
   to fulfill."

   The Law's demands were met and fulfilled for Believers by Christ. But
   as far as those demands are concerned to those who are under it, they
   are as great, as heavy, and as rigorous as ever they were. Unless His
   Law could be altered, and that is impossible, God cannot accept
   anything but a perfect obedience. And if you are hoping to be saved by
   your sincere endeavors to do your best, your hopes are rotten things.
   They are delusions, falsehoods--and you will perish wrapped up in the
   shrouds of your pride.

   "Yes," some say, "but could it not be partly by Grace and partly by
   works?" No. The Apostle says that boasting is excluded and excluded by
   the law of faith. But if we let in the Law of works in any degree, we
   cannot shut out boasting, for to that degree you give man an
   opportunity to congratulate himself as having saved himself. Let me say
   broadly--to hope to be saved by works is a delusion. To hope to be
   saved by a method in which Divine Grace and works are co-acting, is not
   merely a delusion but an absurd delusion.

   It is contrary to the very nature of things--that Divine Grace and
   merit should ever mingle and co-work. Our Apostle has declared times
   without number that if it is of Grace, it is not of works, otherwise
   Grace is no more Divine Grace. And if it is of works, then it is not of
   Grace, otherwise work is no more work. It must be either one or the
   other. These two cannot be married, for God forbids the bands. He will
   have it all Grace or all works, all of Christ or all of man. But for
   Christ to be a make-weight, for Christ to supplement your narrow robes
   by patching on a piece of His own, for Christ to tread a part of the
   winepress, and for you to tread the rest--oh, this can never be!

   God will never be yoked with the creature. You might link an angel with
   a worm and bid them fly together! But God with the creature? The
   precious blood of Jesus with the foul ditch-water of our human merits?
   Never! Never! Our paste gems, our varnished falsehoods, our
   righteousnesses which are but filthy rags--put with the real, true,
   precious, everlasting, Divine things of Christ? Never! Unless Heaven
   should blend in alliance with Hell, and holiness hold dalliance with
   impurity, it must be one or the other--either man's merit, absolutely
   and alone--or unmixed, unmerited favor from the Lord.

   Now, I suppose if I were to labor ever so arduously to hunt out this
   evil spirit from the sons of men, I should miss it, still, for it hides
   in so many shapes. Therefore let me say that in no shape, in no sense,
   in no single case and in no degree whatsoever, are we saved by our
   works or by the Law. I say in no sense, because men make such shifts to
   save alive their own righteousness. I will show you one man who says,
   "Well, I don't expect to be saved by my honesty. I don't expect to be
   saved by my generosity, nor by my morality. But then, I have been
   baptized. I receive the Lord's Supper. I have been confirmed. I go to
   Church, or I have a sitting in a meeting house. I am, as touching the
   ceremonies, blameless."

   Well, Friend, in that sense you cannot be saved by works, for all these
   things have no avail whatever upon the matter of salvation, if you have
   not faith. If you are saved, God's ordinances will be blessed things to
   you. But if you are not a

   Believer you have no right to them. And with regard to Baptism and the
   Supper, every time you touch them you increase your guilt. Whether it
   is Baptism or the Lord's Supper, you have no right to either, unless
   you are saved already. They are both ordinances for Believers and for
   Believers, only. These ordinances are blessed means of Divine Grace to
   living, quickened, saved souls.

   But to unsaved souls, to souls dead in trespasses and sins, these
   outward ordinances can have no avail for good but may increase their
   sin, because they touch unworthily the holy things of God. Oh, repose
   not in these! Oh, dream not that a priestly hand and sacred drops, or a
   God-ordained Baptism in the pool, can in any way redeem you from sin,
   or land you in Heaven--for by this way salvation is impossible. But if
   I drive the lover of self-righteousness out of this haunt, he runs to
   another.

   You will find others who suppose that at least their feelings, which
   are only their works in another shape, may help to save them. There are
   thousands who think, "If I could weep so much, and groan so deeply, and
   experience so much humiliation, and a certain quantity of repentance,
   and so much of the terrors of the Law, and of the thunders of
   conscience, then I might come before God." Souls, Souls, this is
   work-mongering in its most damnable shape, for it has deluded far more
   than that bolder sort of work-trusting, which says, "I will rely upon
   what I do."

   If you rely upon what you feel, you shall as certainly perish as if you
   trust to what you do. Repentance is a work of the Holy Spirit, and to
   be convinced of sin by God the Holy Spirit is a holy privilege. But to
   think that these other things in any way win salvation is to run clean
   counter to all the teachings of the Word, for salvation is of the Free
   Grace of God, alone. There are some, moreover, who believe that if
   their feelings cannot do it, still their knowledge can. They have a
   very sound creed. They have struck out this doctrine and that. They
   believe in justification by faith, and their sound creed is to them a
   confidence. They think that because they hold the theory of
   justification by faith, therefore they shall be saved.

   And oh, how they plume their feathers! How they set up their peacock
   tail because they happen to be orthodox! With what awful pride do they
   exult over their fellow professors because they hold the truth and all
   the rest of the Church, they think, is deluded with a lie. Now this is
   nothing but salvation by works, only they are works performed by the
   head instead of by the hands.

   Oh, Sirs, I will tell you--if you rest in creeds, if you hope to be
   saved because you can put your hand to the thirty-nine articles of an
   Episcopalian prayer book, or to the solemn league and covenant of the
   Presbyterian, or to the confession of faith of the Calvinist--if you
   fancy that because you happen to receive truth in the head you shall be
   saved, you know not the Truth of God but still cling to Satan's
   lie--that salvation is of man and not of God!

   I know that self-righteousness was born in our bones and that it will
   come out in our flesh and even that man in whom its reigning power is
   kept down will still feel it sometimes rising up. When he has preached
   a sermon and has got on pretty well, the devil will come up the pulpit
   stairs and say, "Well done." When he has prayed in public and has had
   unusual fluency, he will have to be careful lest there should be a
   whisper behind--"What a good and gifted man you are." Yes, and even in
   his hallowed moments, when he is on the top of the mountain with his
   Lord, he will have to watch, even there, lest self-congratulation
   should suggest--"Oh, Man, greatly-Beloved, there must surely be
   something in you, or else God would not have done thus unto you."

   Brethren, when you are thinking of your sanctification, if you are
   tempted to look away from Christ--away with it! And if when you are
   repenting of sin you cannot still have one eye on Christ, remember it
   will be a repentance that will need to be repented of, for there is
   nothing in ourselves that can be offered to God.

   There is a stench and putridity in everything that is done of the
   Creature, and we can never come before God except through Christ Jesus,
   who is made of God unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification
   and redemption. I have thus tried to denounce the plan which God has
   rejected.

   II. I shall now, in the second head, SHOW THAT BOASTING IS EXCLUDED,
   for in a blessed sense God has accepted the second plan, namely, the
   way of salvation by faith through Divine Grace.

   The first man that entered Heaven, entered Heaven by faith. "By faith
   Abel offered a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain." Over the tombs of
   all the goodly who were accepted of God, you may read the
   epitaph--"These all died in faith." By faith they received the promise.
   And among all yonder bright and shining throng, there is not one who
   does not confess, "We have washed our robes and made them white in the
   blood of the Lamb."

   The plan, then, which God has chosen, is one of Divine Grace, alone. I
   will try and picture that plan before our mind's eye. We will imagine
   Boasting to be exceedingly desirous to enter into the kingdom of
   Heaven. He marches to the door and knocks. The porter looks out and
   demands, "Who stands there?" "I am Boasting," says he, "and I claim to
   have the highest seat. I claim that I should cry aloud and say, Glory
   be unto man, for though he has fallen, he has lifted himself up and
   worked out his own redemption."

   And the angel says, "But have you not heard that the salvation of souls
   is not of man, nor by man, but that God will have mercy on whom He will
   have mercy and will have compassion on whom He will have compassion?
   Get you gone, Boasting, for the highest seat can never be yours, when
   God, in direct opposition to human merit, has rejected the Pharisee and
   chosen the publican and the harlot, that they may enter into the
   kingdom of Heaven."

   So Boasting says, "Let me take my place, then, if not in the highest
   seat, yet somewhere amid the glittering throng. For instance, let me
   take my place in the seat of election. Let it be said and taught, that
   albeit God did choose His people, yet it was because of their works
   which He foresaw and their faith which He foreknew and that, therefore,
   foreseeing and foreknowing, He did choose them because of an excellence
   which His prescient eye discovered in them. Let me take my seat here."

   But the porter says, "No, you can not take your place there, for
   election is according to the eternal purpose of God, which He purposed
   in Christ Jesus before the world was. This election is not of works but
   of Grace and the reason for God's choice of man is in Himself and not
   in man. And as for those virtues which you say God did foreknow, God is
   the Author of all of them if they exist, and that which is an effect
   cannot be a first cause. God foreordained these men to faith and to
   good works and their faith and good works could not have been the cause
   of their foreordination.

   Then straight from Heaven's gate the trumpet sounded--("For the
   children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that
   the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works but
   of Him that calls it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the
   younger"). Then Boasting found that as works had no place in election,
   so there was no room for him to take his seat there and he bethought
   himself where next he could be.

   So after a while Boasting says to the porter, "If I cannot mount the
   chair of election, I will be content to sit in the place of conversion,
   for surely it is man that repents and believes." The porter did not
   deny the truth of that, and then this evil Boasting said, "If one man
   believes and not another, surely that must be the act of the man's
   will. And his will being free and unbiased, it must be very much to
   that man's credit that he believes and repents and is therefore saved.
   For others, having like opportunities with himself and having the same
   Grace no doubt, reject the preferred mercy and perish, while this man
   accepts it and therefore let me at least take my seat there."

   But the angel said in anger, "Take your seat there? Why, that were to
   take the highest place of all, for this is the hinge and turning-point
   and if you leave that with man then you give him the brightest jewel in
   the crown. Does the Ethiopian change his skin and the leopard his
   spots? Is it not God that works in us to will and to do of His own good
   pleasure? Of His own will He begat us with the Word of Truth and it is
   not of the will of man, nor of blood, nor of birth. Oh, Boasting, your
   free will is a lie!

   It is not man that chooses God but God that chooses Man. What did
   Christ say--"You have not chosen Me but I have chosen you." And what
   did He say to the ungodly multitude, "You will not come unto Me that
   you might have life." In which He gave the death-blow to all ideas of
   free will--when He declared that man will not come to Him that he might
   have life. And then He said again, in another place, as if that were
   not enough, "No man can come unto Me except the Father which has sent
   Me draw him."

   So Boasting, though he was glad not to admit it, was shut out and could
   not take his place in Heaven upon the stool of conversion. And while he
   stood there but little abashed, for bashfulness he knows not, he heard
   a song floating over the battlements of Heaven from all the multitude
   who were there, in accents like these, "Not unto us, not unto us but
   unto Your name, O Lord, be the praise"--

   "It was the same love that spread the feast That gently forced us in;
   Else we had still refused to taste, And perished in our sin."

   But then," said Boasting, "if I may not have so high a place, let me at
   least sit on the lowly stool of perseverance and let it at least be
   said that while God saved the man and is therefore to have the glory,
   still the man was faithful to Grace received. He did not turn back unto
   perdition but watched and was very careful and kept himself in the love
   of God and therefore there is considerable credit due to him. For while
   many drew back and perished and he might have done the same, he
   struggled against sin. And thus by his using his Grace he kept himself
   safely. Let me sit, then, on the chair of perseverance."

   But the angel replied, "No, no, what have you to do with it? I know it
   is written, 'keep yourselves in the love of God,' but the same Apostle
   forbids all fleshly trust in human effort by that blessed
   doxology--'Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling and to
   present you faultless before the Presence of His glory with exceeding
   joy, to the only wise God our Savior, be glory and majesty, dominion
   and power, both now and forever. Amen.' That which is a command in one
   Scripture is a Covenant promise in another, where it is written, 'I
   will put My fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from Me.' "

   Oh, Brethren, well do you and I know that our standing does not depend
   upon ourselves. If that Arminian doctrine, that our perseverance rests
   somewhere in our own hands, were true, then damnation must be the lot
   of us all. I cannot keep myself a minute, much less year after year--

   "Ifever it should come to pass, That sheep of Christ should fall away;
   My fickle, feeble soul, alas! Would fall a thousand times a day."

   But what says the Scripture?--"I give unto My sheep eternal life and
   they shall never perish, neither shall anyone pluck them out of My
   hand,. My Father who gave them Me is greater than all and none is able
   to pluck them out of My Father's hand." And what says the Apostle--"I
   am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
   principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
   from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

   I have not time to quote all the innumerable passages, but it is
   absolutely certain that if there is one doctrine in Scripture more
   clearly revealed than another, it is the doctrine of the Perseverance
   of the Saints by the power of the Holy Spirit. The man who doubts that
   precious Truth of God has quite as much reason to doubt the Trinity, to
   doubt the divinity of Christ, or the fact of the atonement. For nothing
   can be more clear in the plain, common sense meaning of the words than
   this--that they who are in Christ have, even today, eternal life and
   shall never perish.

   Now, since this perseverance is not dependent upon our works, but like
   all the rest of salvation, is an efflux from the bottomless love of
   God, boasting is manifestly excluded. But once again and lastly,
   Boasting sometimes asks to be admitted a little into glorification. I
   fear sometimes that a doctrine which is popular in the Church, about
   degrees of glory, is not altogether unassociated with that old
   self-righteousness of ours which is very loath to die.

   "One star differs from another star in Glory" is a great truth--but
   this the stars may do without differing in degrees. One star may shine
   with one radiance and another with another. Indeed, astronomers tell us
   that there are many varieties of color among stars of the same
   magnitude. One man may differ from another, without supposing a
   difference in rank, honor, or degree. For my part, I do not see
   anything about degrees in Glory in Scripture, and I do not believe in
   the doctrine--at least if there are degrees, mark this--they cannot be
   according to works but must be of Divine Grace alone.

   I cannot consider that because one Christian has been more devoted to
   Christ than another, therefore there will be an eternal difference, for
   this is to introduce works. This is to bring in again the old Hagar
   marriage and to bring back the child of the bondwoman, whereof God has
   said, "The son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with My son, even
   with Isaac."

   Oh, Brethren, I think we can serve God from some other motive than that
   base one of trying to be greater than our Brethren in Heaven. If I
   should get to Heaven at all, I do not care who is greater than I am,
   for if anyone shall have more happiness in Heaven than I shall, then I
   shall have more happiness, too. For the sympathy between one soul and
   another will there be so intense and so great, that all the heavens of
   the righteous will be my Heaven. And therefore, what you have, I shall
   have, because we shall all be one in fellowship far more perfectly than
   on earth.

   The private member will there be swallowed up in the common body.
   Surely, Brethren, if any of you can have brighter places in Heaven, and
   more happiness and more joy than I, I will be glad to know it. The
   prospect does not excite any envy in my soul now, or if it did now, it
   certainly would not then--for I should feel that the more you had the
   more I should have. Perfect communion in all good things is not
   compatible with the private enrichment of one above another.

   Even on earth the saints had all things common when they were in a
   heavenly state and I am persuaded they will have all things common in
   Glory. I do not believe in gentlemen in Heaven and the poor Christians
   behind the door. I believe that our union with each other will be so
   great that distinctions will be utterly lost, and that we shall all
   have such a joint communion and interest and fellowship, that there
   will be no such thing as private possession, private ranks and private
   honors. We shall there, to the fullest extent, be one in Christ.

   I do believe that Boasting is shut out there. But I think that if there
   were these degrees in glory, I mean if they are dependent on works done
   on earth, Boasting would at least get his tail in. If it did not
   insinuate its whole body, it would at least get some of its unhallowed
   members over the wall, whereas, the text says it is excluded. Let me
   enlarge this one word and then proceed. It does not say, "Boasting, you
   are to be allowed to come in and sit down on the floor." No, shut the
   door and do not let him in at all.

   "But let me in," he says," and I will be quiet." No, shut him out
   altogether. "But at least let me put my foot in." No, exclude him--shut
   him out altogether. "But at least let me sometimes go in and out." No,
   shut him out altogether. Exclude him--bolt the door--put double
   padlocks on it. Say once and for all, "Boasting, get you gone. You are
   hurled down and broken in pieces and if you can refit yourself and come
   once more to the gate to ask admittance, you shall be driven away with
   shame." It is excluded. It cannot be let in, in any sense, in any term,
   nor in any degree.

   As Calvin says, "Not a particle of boasting can be admitted, because
   not a particle of work is admitted into the Covenant of Grace." It is
   of Divine Grace from top to bottom, from Alpha to Omega. It is not of
   man nor by man, not of him that wills, nor of him that runs but of God
   that shows mercy and therefore, boasting is excluded by the law of
   faith.

   III. And now, thirdly and very briefly. Beloved in Christ Jesus, what a
   precious Truth of God I have now to hold up to the eyes of poor lost
   sinners, who today are aware that they have no merits of their own.
   Soul, THE VERY GATE WHICH SHUTS OUT BOASTING, SHUTS IN HOPE AND JOY FOR
   YOU.

   Let me state this Truth of God broadly, that the ignorant may catch it.
   You say today, "Sir, I never attend the House of God and up to this
   time I have been a thief and a drunkard." Well, you stand today on the
   same level as the most moral sinner and the most honest unbeliever, in
   the matter of salvation. They are lost, since they believe not, and so
   are you. If the most honest is saved, it will not be by their honesty
   but by the Free Grace of God. And if the most evil would be saved, it
   must be by the same plan.

   There is one gate to Heaven for the most chaste and the most debauched.
   When we come to God, the best of us can bring nothing, and the worst of
   us can bring no less. I know when I state it thus, some will say, "Then
   what is the good of morality?" I will tell you. Two men have fallen
   overboard. One man has a dirty face and the other a clean one. There is
   a rope thrown over from the stern of the vessel and only that rope will
   save the sinking men--whether their faces are fair or foul. Is not this
   the truth? Do I therefore underrate cleanliness. Certainly not--but it
   will not save a drowning man.

   Nor will morality save a dying man. The clean man may sink with all his
   cleanliness and the dirty man may be drawn up with all his filth, if
   the rope does but get its hold of him. Or take this case. Here we have
   two persons, each with a deadly cancer. One of them is rich and clothed
   in purple, the other is poor and wrapped about with a few rags. And I
   say to them--"You are both on a par now, here comes the Physician
   Himself--Jesus, the King of disease--His touch can heal you both. There
   is no difference between you whatever."

   Do I therefore say that the one man's robes are not better than the
   others rags? Of course they are better in some respects but they have
   nothing to do with the matter of curing disease. So morality is a neat
   cover for foul venom but it does not alter the fact that the heart is
   vile and the man, himself, under condemnation. Suppose I were an army
   surgeon and there had been a battle. There is one man there--he is a
   captain and a brave man. He led his rank into the thick of the battle
   and he is bleeding out his life from a terrible gash. By his side there
   lies a man of the rank and file, and a great coward, too, wounded in
   the same way.

   I come up to both of them and I say, "You are both in the same
   condition. You have both the same sort of wound and I can heal you
   both." But if either of you should say, "Get you gone. I'll have
   nothing to do with you," your wound will be your death. If the captain
   should say, "I do not want you. I am a captain, go and see to that poor
   dog yonder." Would his courage and rank save his life? No, they are
   good things but not saving things. So is it with good works, men can be
   damned with them as well as without them if they make them their beast.

   Oh, what a Gospel is this to preach in our theatres. To tell those
   hedge-birds, those who are full of all manner of loathsomeness, that
   there is the same way of salvation open to them as to a peer of the
   realm, or a bishop on the bench. That there is no difference between us
   in the way of mercy, that we are all condemned. That there may be
   degrees as to our guilt but that the fact of our condemnation is quite
   as certain to the best as to the worst!

   "Oh" you say, "this is a leveling doctrine!" Ah, bless God if you are
   leveled. "Oh," you say, "but this cuts at everything that is good in
   man!" Ah, thank God, if it kills everything in which man glories, for
   that which man thinks to be good is often an abomination in the sight
   of God. And oh, if all of us together, moral or immoral, chaste or
   debauched, honest or unholy, can come with the rope about our neck and
   with the weeds of penitence upon our loins and say, "Great God, forgive
   us. We are all guilty, give us Grace. We do not deserve it. Bestow upon
   us Your favor, we have no right to it but give it to us because Jesus
   died."

   Oh, He will never cast out one that way, for that is the way of
   salvation. And if we can put our hand this morning-- no matter though
   it were black last night with lust, or red up to the elbow with
   murder--yet if we can put our hand on Jesus' head and believe on
   Him--the blood of Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleans us from all sin.
   Where is boasting now? You who have done so much for humanity--you
   cannot boast--for you have nothing to boast of. You fine gentlemen and
   noble ladies, what do you say of this?

   O be wise and join in the prayer, "But You, O Lord, have mercy upon us,
   miserable sinners!" And may the Lord then pronounce over us His
   sentence, "You are clean, go and sin no more. Your iniquities are all
   forgiven you."

   IV. I close by just observing, that THE SAME PLAN WHICH SHUTS OUT
   BOASTING LEADS US TO A GRACIOUS GRATITUDE TO CHRIST.

   We are sometimes asked by people, "So you think that such a thing is
   necessary to salvation?" or, perhaps, the question is put in another
   way, "How long do you think a man must be godly in order to be saved?"
   I reply, dear Friend, you cannot understand us, for we hold that these
   things do not save in any sense. "Why, then," they say, "are you
   baptized?" or, "Why do you walk in holiness?" Well, not to save myself
   but because I am saved. When I know that every sin of mine is forgiven,
   that I cannot be lost, that Christ has sworn to bring me to the place
   where He is--then I say, Lord what is there that I can do for You?

   Tell me. Can I burn for You? Blessed were the stake if I might kiss it.
   If You have done so much for me, what can I do for You? Is there an
   ordinance that involves self-denial? Is there a duty which will compel
   me to self-sacrifice? So much the better--

   "Now for the love I bear His name, What was my gain I count my lost; By
   former pride I call my shame, And nail my glory to His Cross." This is
   the way to do good works. And good works are impossible until we come
   here. Anything that you do by which to save yourself is a selfish act,
   and therefore cannot be good. Only that which is done for God's glory
   is good in a Scriptural sense.

   A man must be saved before he can do a good work. But when saved,
   having nothing to get and nothing to lose-- standing now in Christ,
   blessed and accepted--he begins to serve God out of pure gratitude and
   love. Then, virtue is possible and he may climb to its highest steeps
   and stand safely there without fear of the boasting which would cast
   him down. He will feel, even then, that his standing is not in what he
   has done, nor in what he is, nor in what he hopes to be but in what
   Christ did and in the, "It is finished," which made his eternal
   salvation secure.

   O for Divine Grace, that we may live to the praise of the glory of His
   Grace, wherein He has made us accepted in the Beloved, bringing forth
   the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory
   and praise of God. Of Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To
   Him be glory forever. Amen.

                             Two Advents Of Christ

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 22, 1861, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And as is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment:
   So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that
   look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto
   salvation.'" Hebrews 9:27,28.

   We must begin by noticing the parallel which the Apostle here draws.
   The words "as" and "so" suggest a comparison between two Truths of God,
   the correspondence of which he designed to set forth. The one a fact
   generally allowed, the other a fact he was anxious to inculcate. Now
   you will note that he says, "It is appointed unto men once to die," and
   only once. This is a truism. The rule is universal. The exceptions are
   inconsiderable. One or two persons may have died twice. As, for
   instance, Lazarus, and those others who were raised from the dead by
   Christ. These, we cannot doubt, after living for a little while,
   returned again to the tomb.

   But for the most part, speaking of the race, "It is appointed unto men
   once to die." The greatest affairs of life can only be performed once.
   We are once born naturally--are once born spiritually. There are not
   two natural births, neither are there two spiritual births. We live on
   earth but once. We die but once. We shall be judged but once. We shall
   receive the final sentence but once, and then we shall once be received
   into the joy of our Lord forever, or once be driven from His Presence
   never to return.

   Now, a part of the Apostle's parallel lies here. As men die but once,
   so Christ has died but once. As the Law required but one death, so
   Jesus Christ, having offered that one death as the ransom for His
   people, achieved His task. "In the day that you eat thereof you shall
   surely die," was the penalty. "Christ died for our sins according to
   the Scriptures," was the payment. "By one man sin entered into the
   world and death by sin." That is the first fact. "But now once in the
   end of the world has He appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of
   Himself." This is the second fact.

   But you have not got the full weight of the comparison yet. After man's
   spirit has been once on earth, has lived its time, and the body has
   died, the soul is to revisit this earth again, for "after this the
   judgment." Every man will have two advents--the advent which he now
   enjoys or which he now misuses upon earth--and the advent which lies
   beyond the present course of probation. After he has descended to the
   tomb, he shall come here again. His bones shall come together, bone to
   his bone. The flesh shall come upon the skeleton and the spirit shall
   return, either from the Heaven where it rejoices, or from the Hell
   where it howls, to inhabit the body once again, and to stand upon the
   earth.

   We must all come here again--even though the place that now knows us
   shall know us no more forever. Yet, somewhere upon this earth we shall
   stand, even though we should be unable to recognize any likeness
   between that and the place in which we lived, and unable to recognize
   any likeness between us and what we were. Regardless, here we must
   return to receive our appointed doom.

   Now, so is it with Christ. He has once died and He is to come a second
   time. A second time is His body to be on earth. After death, the
   judgment! Only when we speak of Christ, He shall come, not to be judged
   but to be the Judge. After death comes the reward with us--after death
   the reward with Him. After our death comes our resurrection. That has
   passed already upon Christ. As a resurrection shall come to saint and
   sinner, the final audit and pronunciation of the sentence--so Christ
   shall come to the final gathering together of His elect and the final
   overthrow of all His enemies, to the final crowning of His head--when
   He shall have put all things under His feet and reign forever and ever.

   Having thus, I think, brought out the parallel of the text, I will
   leave it for you to think over. As it is appointed unto men to die once
   and after this the judgment, so it was appointed unto Christ to die but
   once. That is achieved. The sequel is now pointed out. To them that
   look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto
   salvation. We will spend our time tonight, and God grant that we may
   spend it profitably, by observing, first, the likeness between the two
   advents of Christ. Secondly, the dissimilarity between them, which is a
   far more extensive subject. And then we shall make a few remarks
   concerning our personal interest in both advents.

   I. The text asserts very plainly that as we are here twice--once in a
   life of probation and a second time in the Day of Judgment--so Christ
   shall be here twice--once in His life of suffering and then again in
   His hour of triumph,

   THE TWO COMINGS OF CHRIST HAVE SOME DEGREE OF LIKENESS. First, they are
   like each other in the fact that they are both of them Personal
   comings. Christ came the first time, not as a spirit, for a spirit has
   not flesh and bones as He had. He was One who could be pressed to a
   woman's bosom, One who could be borne in a father's arms. He was One
   who could afterwards walk in His own Person to the temple--One who
   could bear our sins in His own body on the tree.

   We have done once and for all with the foolish ideas of certain of the
   early heretics, that Christ's appearance upon earth was but a phantom.
   We know that He was really, personally, and physically here on earth.
   But it is not quite so clear to some persons that He is to come really,
   personally and literally, the second time. I know there are some who
   are laboring to get rid of the fact of a personal reign, but as I take
   it, the coming and the reign are so connected, that we must have a
   spiritual coming if we are to have a spiritual reign.

   Now we believe and hold that Christ shall come a second time, suddenly,
   to raise His saints at the first resurrection. This shall be the
   commencement of the grand judgment and they shall reign with Him
   afterwards. The rest of the dead live not till after the thousand years
   are finished. Then shall they rise from their tombs at the sounding of
   the trumpet and their judgment shall come and they shall receive the
   deeds which they have done in their bodies.

   Now, we believe that the Christ who shall sit on the Throne of His
   father David, and whose feet shall stand upon Mount Olivet, is as much
   a personal Christ as the Christ who came to Bethlehem and wept in the
   manger. We do believe that the very Christ whose body did hang upon the
   tree shall sit upon the Throne. That the very hands that felt the nails
   shall grasp the scepter. That the very feet that were fastened to the
   Cross shall tread upon the necks of His foes. We look for the personal
   advent, the personal reign, the personal session and court of Christ.

   Nor less shall the advents be like each other in the fact that they
   shall both be according to promise. The promise of the first coming of
   Christ was that which made glad the early Believers. "Your father
   Abraham rejoiced to see My day, he saw it and was glad." The epitaph
   inscribed upon the slab which covers the sepulcher of the early saints
   has written upon it, "These all died in faith, not having received the
   promises, but having seen them afar off." And today we believe that
   Christ is to come according to promise.

   We think we have abundant evidence in the Words that were uttered by
   the lips of inspired Prophets and Seers, and more especially from the
   enraptured pen of John in Patmos. Do they not testify that Christ shall
   surely come? We now, like Abraham of old, do see His day. Our eyes
   catch the coming splendor. Our soul is overwhelmed with the approaching
   glory. Did the Jew look for Messiah, the Prince? So do we. Did he
   expect Him to reign? So do we. In fact, the very Prince for whom Israel
   now looks in all her hardness of heart, is He whom we expect.

   They doubt Messiah's first advent and they look for Him to come as the
   fairest among ten thousand, the Prince of the Kings of the earth. Hail,
   Israel! In this your Gentile sister is agreed. She looks for Him to
   come in the same form and fashion. And when His coming shall have
   removed the scales from the blind eyes of Israel's tribes, then the
   fullness of the Gentiles shall, with Abraham's seed, praise and magnify
   the Lamb once slain, who comes the second time as the Lion of the tribe
   of Judah. In both cases we think the advent of Christ fully promised.

   But we must remark in the next place, that the second advent of Christ
   will be like the first in its being unexpected by the mass of people.
   When He came before, there were only a few looking for Him. Simeon and
   Anna and some humble souls of the sort knew that He was about to come.
   The others knew that the Patriarchs and Prophets of their nation had
   foretold His birth. But the vanity of their thoughts, and the conduct
   of their lives were at such entire variance with the creed to which
   they were trained, they cared nothing for Him.

   The Magi might come from the distant East, and the shepherds from the
   adjacent plains--but how little sensation did they make in the streets
   of busy Jerusalem, in the halls of kings, or in the homes of business?
   The kingdom of God came not with observation. In such an hour as they
   thought not, the Son of Man came. And now, though we have the Words of
   Scripture to assure us that He will come quickly and that His reward is
   with Him and His work before Him-- yet how few expect Him!

   The coming of some foreign Prince, the approach of some great event, is
   looked for and anticipated from the hour that the purpose is
   promulgated among the people. But Your coming, Jesus, Your glorious
   advent--where are they that strain their eyes to catch the first beams
   of the Sun rising? There are a few of Your followers who wait for Your
   appearing. We meet with a few men who walk as those who know that time
   is short and that the Master may come at cockcrow-ing, or at midnight,
   or at the day watch.

   We know a few beloved disciples who, with longing hearts, beguile the
   weary hours, while they prepare songs to greet You, O Immanuel!--

   "Strangers on earth, we wait for You; O leave the Father's Throne, Come
   with a shout of victory, Lord, And claim us as Your own. No resting
   place we seek on earth, No loveliness we see, Our eye is on the royal
   Throne, Prepared for us and You.'

   Lord, increase the number of those who look for You, and desire You,
   and pray and wait for You, and watch through the dreary hours of the
   night for the morning which Your coming shall usher in!

   Yet, mark, when He shall come, there will be this to say about it, that
   He will come to bless those who do wait for Him just as He did at the
   first. Blessed were the eyes that saw Him! Blessed were the hearts that
   loved Him! Blessed were the ears that heard Him! Blessed were the lips
   that kissed Him! Blessed were the hands that broke the tributary
   alabaster box upon His glorious head--and blessed shall they be who are
   counted worthy of the resurrection and of the kingdom which He has
   prepared!

   Blessed are they who, having been born of the Spirit, can see the
   kingdom of God. But doubly blessed are they who, having been born of
   water as well as of the Spirit, shall enter into the kingdom of God!
   For unto all this is not given. There are some who will not see the
   kingdom and others who cannot enter because they will not obey the
   ordinances which makes them Christ's disciples. Thrice blessed shall
   they be who, with loins girt about, being obedient servants, and having
   done His will, shall hear Him say, "Come you blessed, inherit the
   kingdom prepared for you from before the foundation of the world." He
   comes to bless His people.

   But then there is this further likeness and with the mention of it, I
   close this first point--He comes, not only to bless His people but to
   be a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to them that believe not
   upon Him. When He came the first time, He was like a refiner's fire and
   like fuller's soap. As the refiner's fire burns up the dross, so did He
   consume the Pharisees and Sadducees--and as the fuller's soap cleanses
   away the filth, so did He unto that generation when He condemned it,
   even as Jonah the Prophet did unto the men of Nineveh and thereby
   condemned the men of Jerusalem because they repented not.

   Thus too, when He shall come the second time, while He shall bless His
   people, His fan will be in His hand and He will thoroughly purge His
   floor and they who know Him not, and love Him not, shall be driven away
   like the chaff into unquenchable fire. Long not for Christ's coming if
   you love Him not, for the Day of the Lord will be unto you darkness,
   and not light. Ask not for the world's end--say not, "Come quickly,"
   for His coming will be your destruction--His advent will be the coming
   of your eternal horror. God grant us Divine Grace to love the Savior
   and put our trust in Him. Then, but not till then, we may say, "Come
   quickly, come quickly, Lord Jesus!"

   II. Now we shall turn to the second part of our subject, THE UNLIKENESS
   BETWEEN THE TWO ADVENTS.

   In the prophecy of His coming the first and the second time there was
   disparity as well as correspondence. It is true in both cases He will
   come attended by angels and the song shall be, "Glory to God in the
   highest, on earth peace, goodwill towards men." It is true in both
   cases, shepherds who keep watch over their flocks, even by night, shall
   be among the first to hail Him with their sleepless eyes--blessed
   shepherds who watch Christ's folds, and therefore shall see the Great
   Shepherd when He comes.

   Still, how different, I say, will be His coming. At first He came as an
   Infant of a span long. Now He shall come--

   "In rainbow wreath and clouds of storm," the Glorious One. Then He
   entered into a manger, now He shall ascend His Throne. Then He sat upon
   a woman's knees and did hang upon a woman's breast. Now earth shall be
   at His feet and the whole universe shall hang upon His everlasting
   shoulders. Then He appeared the Infant, now the Infinite. Then He was
   born to trouble as the sparks fly upward, now He comes to glory as the
   lightning from one end of Heaven to the other.

   A stable received Him then. Now the high arches of earth and Heaven
   shall be too little for Him. Horned oxen were then His companions, but
   now the chariots of God which are twenty thousand, even thousands of
   angels, shall be at His right hand. Then in poverty His parents were
   too glad to receive the offerings of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
   But now in splendor, King of kings, and Lord of lords, all nations
   shall bow before Him--and kings and princes shall pay homage at His
   feet.

   Still He shall need nothing at their hands, for He will be able to say,
   "If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the cattle are Mine upon a
   thousand hills." "You have put all things under His feet. All sheep and
   oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field." "The earth is the Lord's and
   the fullness thereof."

   Nor will there merely be a difference in His coming. There will be a
   most distinct and apparent difference in His Person. He will be the
   same, so that we shall be able to recognize Him as the Man of Nazareth,
   but O, how changed! Where now the carpenter's smock? Royalty has now
   assumed its purple. Where now the toil-worn feet that needed to be
   washed after their long journeys of mercy? They are sandaled with
   light, they "are like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace."
   Where now the cry, "Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have
   nests but I, the Son of Man, have not where to lay My head"?

   Heaven is His Throne. Earth is His footstool. Methinks in the night
   visions I behold the day dawning. And to the Son of Man there is given
   "dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all people, nations and
   languages, should serve Him." Ah, who would think to recognize in the
   weary Man and full of woes, the King eternal, immortal, invisible? Who
   would think that the humble Man, despised and rejected, was the seed
   corn out of which there should grow that full corn in the ear, Christ
   All-Glorious, before whom the angels veil their faces and cry, "Holy,
   holy, holy, Lord God of Sa- baoth"?

   He is the same but yet how changed! You that despised Him, will you
   despise Him now? Imagine the Judgment Day has come and let this vast
   audience represent the gathering of the last dreadful morning. Now you
   who despised His Cross, come forward and insult His Throne! Now you who
   said He was a mere man, come near and resist Him, while He proves
   Himself to be your Creator! Now, you who said, "We will not have this
   man to reign over us," say it now if you dare--repeat now, if you dare,
   your bold presumptuous defiance!

   What? Are you silent? Do you turn your backs and flee? Verily, verily,
   so was it said of you of old. They that hate Him shall flee before Him.
   His enemies shall lick the dust. They shall cry to the rocks to cover
   them and to the hills to hide them from His face. How changed, I say,
   will He be in the appearance of His Person.

   But the difference will be more apparent in the treatment which He will
   then receive. Alas, my Lord, Your reception on earth the first time was
   not such as would tempt You here again. "All they that see Me laugh Me
   to scorn. They thrust out the lip. They say, He trusted in God that He
   would deliver Him, let Him deliver Him if He delights in Him. I am
   become a reproach, the song of the drunkard, a byword and a proverb."
   "When we shall see Him, there is no beauty in Him that we should desire
   Him."

   This was the world's opinion of God's Anointed. So they did salute
   Jehovah's Christ when He came the first time. Blind World, open your
   eyes while the thunderclaps of judgment make you start up in terror and
   amazement and look about you. This is the Man in whom you could see no
   beauty--dare you say the same of Him now? His eyes are like flames of
   fire and out of His mouth goes a two-edged sword. His head and His hair
   are white like wool, as white as snow, and His feet like much fine
   gold. How glorious now! How different, now, the world's opinion of Him!

   Bad men weep and wail because of Him. Good men cry, "All hail! All
   hail! All hail!" They clap their hands and bow their heads and leap for
   joy. Around Him an innumerable company of angels wait--cherubim and
   seraphim with glowing wheels attend at His feet and ever unto Him they
   continually, continually, continually cry--Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
   of Hosts." Let us suppose again that the Judgment Day has come and let
   us challenge the world to treat the Savior as it did before.

   Now, then, Crowds, come and drag Him down, to hurl Him from the hill,
   headlong! Step forward, you Pharisees, and tempt Him and try to
   entangle Him in His words. Herodians, have you no penny now, that you
   may ask Him a difficult question to entrap Him? What? Sadducees, have
   you no riddles left? Aha! Aha! Laugh at the Scribes and at the wise
   men--see how the wise Man of Nazareth has confounded them all! See how
   the Sufferer has put to nothing the persecutors! Come Judas,
   arch-traitor, sell Him for thirty pieces of silver! Come and give Him
   another kiss and play the traitor over again!

   Pilate, come forward and wash your hands in innocence and say," I am
   clear of the blood of this just Person!" See to it, you fathers of the
   Sanhedrin, wake from your long slumbers, and say again, if you dare,
   "This man blasphemes." Smite Him on the cheek you soldiers, buffet Him
   again you praetorians. Set Him once more in the chair and spit in His
   face. Weave your crown of thorns and put it on His head and put the
   reed into His right hand. What? Have you not an old cloak to cast about
   His shoulders again? What? Have you no songs, no ribald jests, and is
   there not a man among you that dares, now, to pluck his hair?

   No, see them, how they flee! Their loins are loosed. The shields of the
   mighty have been cast to the winds. Their courage has failed them. The
   brave Romans have turned cowards and the haughty bulls of Bashan have
   hastened away from their pastures. And now, you Jews, cry, "Away with
   Him," now let His blood be on you and on your children! Now come
   forward, you ribald crew and mock Him as you did upon the Cross. Point
   to His wounds, jeer at His nakedness-- mock His thirst, revile His
   prayer--stand and thrust out your tongues and insult His agonies if you
   dare. You did it once! It is the same Person! Do it again!

   But, no. They throw themselves upon their faces and there goes up from
   the assembled mass a wail such as earth never heard before--not even in
   the day when Mizraim's children felt the angel's sword and, weeping
   worse than it was ever known in Bochim. Hotter tears than Rachel shed
   when she would not be comforted for her children. Weep on! It is too
   late for your sorrow now. Oh, if there had been the tear of penitence
   before, there had not been the weeping of remorse, now. Oh, if there
   had been the glancing of the eye of faith, there had not been the
   blasting and the scorching of your eyes with horrors that shall utterly
   consume you. Christ comes, I say, to be treated very differently from
   the treatment He received before.

   The difference appears once more in this. He will come again for a very
   different purpose. He came the first time with, "I delight to do Your
   will O God." He comes a second time to claim the reward and to divide
   the spoil with the strong. He came the first time with a sin-offering.
   That offering having been once made, there is no more sacrifice for
   sin. He comes the second time to administer righteousness. He was
   righteous at His first coming, but it was the righteousness of
   allegiance. He shall be righteous at His second coming with the
   righteousness of supremacy. He came to endure the penalty, He comes to
   procure the reward. He came to serve, He comes to rule.

   He came to open wide the door of Divine Grace, He comes to shut the
   door. He comes not to redeem but to judge. Not to save but to pronounce
   the sentence. Not to weep while He invites, but to smile while He
   rewards. Not to tremble in heart while He proclaims Grace but to make
   others tremble while He proclaims their doom. Oh Jesus! How great the
   difference between Your first and Your second Advent!

   III. I must now spend the few minutes that remain in ASKING A FEW
   QUESTIONS.

   What has this to do with us? It has something to do with everyone of
   us, from the oldest bald-head here, down to that rosy child who is
   listening with eyes of wonder to the thought that Christ shall come and
   every eye shall see Him. There are many spectacles which only a few
   among the children of men can see but every eye shall see Him. Many of
   us may be gone from this earth before the next great display shall be
   seen in London, but every eye shall see Him. There may be some grand
   sights which you feel no interest in. You would not see them if you
   might, but you shall see Him.

   You would not go to a place of worship to hear Him but you shall see
   Him. Perhaps you went up to the House of God sometimes, and when there,
   vowed you would never go again. Ah, but you will be there then, without
   a question as to your choice. And you will have to remain till the
   close, too, till He pronounces either the benediction or the
   malediction upon your heads. For every eye shall see Him. There is not
   one of us that will be absent on the day of Christ's appearing. We have
   all, then, an interest in it. Alas, it is a sorrowful thought that many
   will see Him to weep and to wail!

   Will you be among that number? No, do not look around to your
   neighbor--will you be among that number? Alas for you! You will, if you
   never weep for sin on earth. If you do not weep for sin on earth you
   shall weep for it there. And, mark, if you do not fly to Christ and
   trust in Him now, you shall be obliged to fly from Him and be accursed
   of Him then. "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
   Anathema Maranatha"--accursed with a curse!

   Paul said that. In the name of the Church, by its most loving and
   tender Apostle, the soul is cursed that loves not Christ! Heaven on
   that day shall solemnly ratify the curse with an "Amen." And the Day of
   Judgment brings its thunders to roll in dreadful chorus the sound,
   "Amen. Let him be accursed if he loves not Christ." But there will be
   some there who, when Christ shall come, shall greatly rejoice to see
   Him. Will you be among that number? Will there be a crown for you? Will
   you share in that magnificent triumph? Will you make one of that royal
   court which shall delight to "see the King in His beauty" in "the land
   that is very far off'?

   Sister, will you be among the daughters of Jerusalem who shall go forth
   to meet King Solomon with the crown his mother crowned Him in the day
   of His espousal? Brother, will you be among those who shall go forth to
   meet the King when He comes with, "Hosanna, blessed is He that comes in
   the name of the Lord"? "I hope so," says one. I hope so, too, but are
   you sure? "Well, I hope so." Do not be content with having a hope
   unless you know it is a good hope through Divine Grace.

   What do you say tonight--have you been born again? Have you passed from
   death to life? Are you a new creature in Christ Jesus? Has the Spirit
   of God had dealings with you? Have you been led to see the fallacy of
   all human trust? Have you been led to see that no good works of yours
   can ever fit you to reign with Christ? Have you been led to discard
   your righteousness as filthy rags? Soul, can you say tonight--

   "My faith does lay her hand
   On that dear head of Yours.
   While like a penitent I stand,
   And there confess my sin"?
   Humbly, feebly, but still earnestly, can you say, "Christ is my All. He
   is all I desire on earth. He is all I need for Heaven"? If so, long for
   His appearing, for you shall see Him, and shall be glorified in Him.
   But beware if you cannot say that!
   We are getting near to the end of the year. This is the last time I
   shall have the pleasure of addressing you this year. Oh that God may
   bring in more in the last week of the year than in all the weeks that
   have gone! It is possible. Nothing is too hard for God. It will
   certainly be so if God shall stir up your hearts, Brothers and Sisters,
   to pray for it. Are there not young men here who are not yet the
   followers of the Lamb? Oh, that tonight, even tonight, the Spirit of
   God may say in your heart, "Turn you! Turn you! Why will you die?" And
   oh, may you be made so uneasy that tonight you will not be able to give
   sleep to your eyes nor slumber to your eyelids till you have put your
   trust in Christ and He is yours!
   Tomorrow probably you will hear the guns betokening the time when the
   ashes of the Prince are put into their resting place. May every gun be
   a sermon to you, and as you hear them booming, let this be its
   message--
   "Come to judgment, Come to judgment, come away." And may you be able to
   answer as you hear it,
   "Yes, blessed be God, I am
   Not afraid to come to judgment, for Bold shall I stand in that great
   day! For who anything to my charge shall lay? While, through Your
   blood, absolved I am, From sin's tremendous curse and shame?" Remember,
   salvation is by Christ. Not of works, nor of the will of man, nor of
   blood, nor birth. And this is the message which Christ bids us deliver,
   "Whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved." Oh, may you
   be led to call on His name by prayer and humble faith and you shall be
   saved. "Whosoever believes on Him is not condemned." Oh, may you
   believe on Him tonight if you never have done so before. Touch the hem
   of His garment, you with the bloody issue. Say, "Jesus, Son of David,
   have mercy on me!"

   You with the blind eye, say, "Lord save me, or I perish!" You who are
   ready to sink, cry out to Jesus! And the ready ears of Jesus and the
   ready hands of the Savior shall now hear and bless if the heart is
   ready, and if the soul is asking mercy. May God grant you the richest
   blessings of His Grace for Christ Jesus' sake. Amen.

   Perhaps it would be improper in the pulpit to wish you "the compliments
   of the season," but I do wish you the blessing of God at all seasons,
   in season and out of season, and that is my blessing upon you
   tonight--that you may have the blessing of God living and His blessing
   dying--His blessing in His advent and His blessing at the Judgment. The
   Lord bless you more and more! May He give you a blessed Christmas and
   the happiest of New Years, and to Him shall be all the praise and the
   honor. Amen.

                           A Secret And Yet No Secret

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JANUARY 26, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "A garden enclosed is My sister, My spouse; a spring shut up, a
   fountain sealed." "A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters and
   streams from Lebanon." Song of Solomon 4:12,15.

   OBSERVE the sweet titles with which Christ, the Husband, addresses His
   Church the bride. "My sister," one near to Me by ties of nature. My
   next of kin, born of the same mother, partaker of the same sympathies.
   My spouse, nearest and dearest, united to Me by the most tender bands
   of love--My sweet companion, part of My own Self. My sister, by My
   Incarnation, which makes Me bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh.
   My spouse, by heavenly betrothal in which I have espoused you unto
   Myself in righteousness. My sister, whom I knew of old and over whom I
   watched from her earliest infancy. My spouse, taken from among the
   daughters, embraced by arms of love and affianced unto Me forever.

   See, my Brethren, how true is it that our royal kinsman is not ashamed
   of us, for He dwells with manifest delight upon this twofold
   relationship. Be not, O Beloved, slow to return the hallowed flame of
   His love. We have the word "My" twice in our version. As if Christ
   dwelt with rapture on His possession of His Church. "His delights were
   with the sons of men," because those sons of men were His. He, the
   Shepherd, sought the sheep, because they were His sheep. He lit the
   candle and swept the house, because it was His money that was lost. He
   has gone about "to seek and to save that which was lost," because that
   which was lost was His long before it was lost to itself or lost to
   Him.

   The Church is the exclusive portion of her Lord's--none else may claim
   a partnership, or pretend to share her love. Jesus, Your Church
   delights to have it so! Let every believing soul drink solace out of
   these wells. Soul, Christ is near to you in ties of relationship!
   Christ is dear to you in bonds of marriage union and you are dear to
   Him. Behold, He grasps both of your hands with both His own, saying,
   "My sister, My spouse." Mark the two sacred holdfasts by which your
   Lord gets such a double hold of you that He neither can, nor will, ever
   let you go. Do you say in your heart this morning, "My Brother, my
   Husband?" Seek to be near to Him in nature--to be like your Brother, an
   eon of God. And to be near to Him in fellowship--that you may know Him
   and have fellowship with Him, being conformable unto His death.

   Leaving this porch of cedar, let us enter the palace. Observe the
   contrast which the two verses present to us. I think that the Spirit of
   God intends that the verses should be understood as we intend to use
   them this morning. But even if we should be mistaken as to the precise
   interpretation of the passage in its connection, we shall not err in
   enlisting so beautiful a string of metaphors in the service of the
   Truth of God.

   You know, Beloved, there are two works of the Holy Spirit within us.
   The first is when He puts into us the living waters. The next is when
   He enables us to pour forth streams of the same living waters in our
   daily life. Our blessed Lord expressed what we mean, when on that great
   day of the feast, He cried, saying, "If any man thirst, let him come
   unto Me and drink. He that believes on Me, as the Scripture has said,
   out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. This spoke He of
   the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive."

   The Spirit of God first implants in us the new nature. This is His
   work--to regenerate us, to put into us the new principle, the life of
   God in Christ. Then next, He gives us power to send forth that life in
   gracious emanations of holiness of life, of devoutness of communion
   with God, of likeness to Christ, of conformity to His image. The
   streams are as much of the Holy Spirit as the fountain itself. He digs
   the well and He afterwards, with heavenly rain, fills the pools. He
   first of all makes the stream in the desert to flow from the flinty
   rock, and afterwards, out of His infinite supplies, He feeds the stream
   and bids it follow us all our days.

   I was pleased to find a quotation the other day, from one of the early
   fathers, which contains in it views I have frequently expressed to
   you--"The true Believer is composed of body, soul, and the Holy
   Spirit." After the greatest research, eminent mental philosophers have
   given up all idea of a third principle which they can discover in man,
   as man.

   They can find nothing but the body and the soul. But, rest assured that
   as there is a certain something in the vegetable which we call
   vegetable life, as there is a sensitive substance which makes animal
   life, as there is a mysterious subsistence developed as mental life, so
   there is some real, substantial, Divine principle forming spiritual
   life.

   The Believer has three principles, the body, the soul, and the
   indwelling Spirit, which is none other than the Holy Spirit of God,
   which abides in the faithful continually. Just such a relationship as
   the soul bears to the body, does the spirit bear to the soul. As the
   body without the soul is dead, so the soul without the Spirit is dead
   in trespasses and sins. As the body without the soul is dead naturally,
   so the soul without the Spirit is dead spiritually.

   And, contrary to the general teaching of modern theologians, we insist
   upon it that the Spirit of God not only renovates the faculties which
   were there already, but does actually implant a new principle--that He
   does not merely set to rights a machinery which had before gone awry,
   but implants a new life which could not have been there. It is not a
   waking up of dormant faculties--it is the infusion of a supernatural
   Spirit to which the natural heart is an utter stranger.

   Now, we think the first verse, to a great extent, sets forth the secret
   and mysterious work of the Holy Spirit in the creation of the new man
   in the soul. Into this secret no eye of man can look. The inner life in
   the Christian may well be compared to an enclosed garden--to a spring
   shut up--to a fountain sealed. But the second verse sets forth the
   manifest effects of Divine Grace, for no sooner is that life given than
   it begins to show itself. No sooner is the mystery of righteousness in
   the heart, than, like the mystery of iniquity, it "does already work."

   It cannot lie still. It cannot be idle. It must not rest. But, as God
   is ever active, so this God-like principle is active, too. Thus you
   have a picture of the outer life, proceeding from the inner. "A
   fountain of gardens, a well of living waters and streams from Lebanon."
   The first is what the Christian is before God. The next is what the
   Christian will become before men. The first is the blessedness which he
   receives in himself. The next is the blessedness which he diffuses to
   others.

   We will begin, then, where God the Holy Spirit begins with us, when He
   enters the recesses of the heart and breathes the secret life.

   I. With regard to the first text. You will clearly perceive that in
   each of the three metaphors you have very plainly the idea of secrecy.
   There is a garden. A garden is a place where trees have been planted by
   a skillful hand. They are nurtured and tended with care, and fruit is
   expected by its owner. Such is the Church--such is each renewed soul.
   But it is a garden enclosed and so enclosed that one cannot see over
   its walls--so shut out from the world's wilderness that the passerby
   must not enter it. It is so protected from all intrusion that it is a
   guarded Paradise--as secret as was that inner place, the holy of
   holies--within the tabernacle of old.

   The Church--and mark, when I say the Church, the same is true of each
   individual Christian--is set forth, next, as a spring. "A spring"--the
   mother of sweet draughts of refreshing water, reaching down into some
   impenetrable caverns and bubbling up with perennial supplies from the
   great deeps. Not a mere cistern, which contains only, but a fresh
   spring, which through an inward principle within, begets, continues,
   overflows. But then, it is a spring shut up--just as there were springs
   in the East, over which an edifice was built, so that none could reach
   the springs save those who knew the secret entrance--so is the heart of
   a Believer when it is renewed by Divine Grace. There is a mysterious
   life within which no human skill can touch.

   And then, it is said to be a fountain. But it is a fountain sealed. The
   outward stones may be discovered, but the door is sealed, so that no
   man can get into the hidden springs. They are altogether hidden and
   hidden, too, by a royal will and decree of which the seal is the
   emblem. I say the idea is very much that of secrecy. Now, such is the
   inner life of the Christian. It is a secret which no other man knows,
   no, which the very man who is the possessor of it cannot tell to his
   neighbor. "The wind blows where it lists and you hear the sound thereof
   but can not tell from where it comes or where it goes. So is everyone
   that is born of the Spirit."

   There are mysteries in nature so profound that we only label them with
   some hard name and leave them--and all the knowledge that we have about
   them is that they are beyond the reach of man. But what are they? What
   are those mysterious impulses which link distant worlds with one
   another? What is the real essence of that power which flashes along the
   electric wire? What is the very substance of that awful force which
   rives the oak, or splits the spire? We do not know. These are
   mysteries.

   And even if we could enter these caverns of knowledge, if we could
   penetrate the secret chamber of nature, if we could climb the lofty
   tree of knowledge till we found the nest where the callow principles of
   nature as yet unfledged are lying-- even then we could not find out
   where that hidden life is. It is a something--as certainly a something
   as the natural life of man. It is a reality--not a dream, not a
   delusion--it is as real (though far more Divine) as that "vital spark"
   which we say is "of heavenly flame." But though real, it is not in
   itself perceptible by human senses. It is so hidden from the eyes of
   men who have it not, that they do not believe in its existence.

   "Oh," they say, "there is no difference between a Christian and another
   man. There may sometimes be a little difference in his outward acts,
   but as to his being the possessor of another life, the idea is silly."
   As to the regenerate being men of a distinct race of beings, as much
   above man naturally as man is above the brute beasts--carnal men would
   scorn to acknowledge. They cannot make this out. How can they? It is a
   spring shut up. It is a fountain sealed. No, and the Christian himself,
   though he feels the throbbing of the great life-force within, though he
   feels the perpetual bubbling up of the ever-living fountain, yet he
   does not know what it is. It is a mystery to him, too.

   He knows it came there once upon a time--perhaps he knows the
   instrumentality by which it came. But what it was he cannot tell. "One
   thing I know, whereas I was blind now I see. Whereas I once loved sin I
   now hate it. Whereas I had no thoughts after God and Christ, now my
   heart is wholly set upon Divine things." This he can say. But how it
   came about, he does not know. Only God did it--did it in some
   mysterious way, by an agency which it is utterly impossible for him to
   detect. There are even times when the Christian himself finds this well
   so shut up that he cannot see it himself-- and he is led to doubt about
   it. "Oh," says he, "I question whether the life of God is in me at
   all."

   I know some have scoffed at the idea of a Christian's being alive, and
   at the same time doubting his spiritual existence. But however great a
   paradox it may seem, it is, nevertheless, a mournful truth in our
   experience. That spring, I say, is sometimes shut up even to ourselves
   and that fountain is so fast sealed, that although it is as really
   there as when we could drink of it, and the garden is as truly there as
   when we refreshed ourselves among its spicy beds, yet we cannot find
   any solace in it.

   There have been times, when if we could have the world for it, we could
   not discover a spark of love in our hearts towards God--no, not a grain
   of faith. Yet He could see our love when our blind eyes could not, and
   He could honor our faith even when we feared we had none. There have
   been moments when, if Heaven and Hell depended on our possession of
   full assurance, we certainly must have been lost--for not only had we
   no full assurance but we had scarcely any faith. Children of light do
   walk in darkness--there are times when they see not their signs--when
   for three days neither sun nor moon appears.

   There are periods when their only cry is, "My God, my God, why have You
   forsaken me?" There is little wonder about this when we see how secret,
   how impalpable, how indiscernible by eye, or touch, or human intellect,
   is the Spirit of God within us. It is little wonder that sometimes
   flesh and blood should fail to know whether the life of God is in us at
   all. "A garden enclosed, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed."

   A second thought is written upon the surface of the text. Here you see
   not only secrecy but separation. That also runs through the three
   figures. It is a garden but it is a garden enclosed--altogether shut
   out from the surrounding heaths and commons--enclosed with briars and
   hedged with thorns, which are impassable by the wild beasts. There is a
   gate through which the great husbandman, himself, can come. But there
   is also a gate which shuts out all those who would only rob the keeper
   of the vineyard of his rightful fruit.

   There is separation in the spring, also. It is not the common spring,
   of which every passerby may drink. It is one so kept and preserved
   distinct from men, that no lip may touch, no eye may even see, its
   secret. It is a something which the stranger doesn't interfere with. It
   is a life which the world cannot give and cannot take away. All
   through, you see, there is a separateness, a distinctness. If it is
   ranged with springs, still it is a spring especially shut up. If it is
   put with fountains, still it is a fountain bearing a particular mark--a
   king's royal seal--so that all can perceive that this is not a general
   fountain but a fountain that has a proprietor and stands especially
   alone by itself.

   So is it with the spiritual life. It is a separate thing. The chosen of
   God, we know, were separated in the eternal decree. Their names were
   written in a different book from the rest of men. The Book of Life
   records their names, and none but theirs. They were separated by God in
   the day of redemption, when Christ redeemed them from among men, out of
   every kindred and nation and tribe. They are separated day by day by
   Divine Providence, for the fiery pillar gives light to them, while it
   is darkness to the Egyptians.

   But their separation, so far as they can most clearly see it, must be a
   separation caused by the possession of the life which others have not.
   I fear there are some professed Christians who have never realized
   this. They are a garden. One could hardly speak ill of their character,
   their carriage is excellent, their deportment amiable. Their good works
   commend them before men, but still they are not separate from sinners.
   In vital essential distinction they have little manifest share. Their
   speech may be half of Canaan but the other half is of Ashdod. They may
   bring unto God thank-offerings but there is a niche in their house for
   Baal, too.

   They have not yet heard the cry, "Come you out of here, My people, that
   you be not partakers of her plagues." Not yet has the mandate of the
   Prophet rung in their ears, "Depart you, depart you, go you out from
   here, be you clean that bear the vessels of the Lord." They are a
   garden, but they are not a garden walled round. Oh, how many we have in
   this day of this kind! They can come to the Church, they can go to the
   world--they can talk as God's people talk--and they can murmur as the
   rebellious murmur. They understand well the gift of prayer, but they
   understand little of the secret of the inner life of devotion.

   Brothers and Sisters, if you and I have ever received that third, that
   noble, that Divine principle, the life of God, into our souls, it will
   be utterly impossible for us to feel at home with the men of the world.
   No, we shall say, "without the camp" must be my place, bearing His
   reproach. Sometimes, indeed, we shall not feel at home with the
   professing Church, we shall be constrained to even come out of her, if
   we would follow the Lord fully. Yes, and there are sacred seasons when
   we shall be so enclosed that we shall not be at ease in any society,
   however select, for our souls will pine for sweet solitude, secret
   communion, hidden embraces. We shall be compelled to walk alone with
   Christ.

   The garden will be shut up even from other gardens, distinct even from
   other places where Christ walks. Oh, there will be periods with your
   soul, if it is renewed, when you must be alone, when the face of man
   will disturb you--and when only the face of Jesus can be company to
   you. I would not give a farthing for that man's spiritual life who can
   live altogether with others. If you do not sometimes feel that you must
   be a garden enclosed, that you must enter into your closet and shut the
   door. If you do not feel seasons when the society of your dearest
   friend is an impediment, and when the face of your sweetest relation
   would but be a cloud between you and Christ, I cannot understand you.

   Be you, O children of Christ, as chaste virgins kept alone for Christ!
   Gad you not abroad, O my Heart, but stay at home with Jesus, your
   Lover, your Lord, your All. Shut up your gates, O my Heart, to all
   company but His. O my sweet well-spring of delights, be shut up to
   every lip but His, and O you fountain of the issues of my heart, be you
   sealed only for Him--that He may come and drink, and drink again, and
   take sweet solace in you--your soul being His, and His alone.

   In the third place, it is worthy of a more distinct remark that you
   have in the text the idea of sacredness. The garden enclosed is walled
   up that it may be sacred to its owner. The spring shut up is preserved
   for the use of some special person. And the fountain sealed more
   eminently still bears the mark of being sacred to some distinguished
   personage. Travelers have said that they have discovered gardens of
   Solomon which were of old enclosed where the king privately walked and
   they have also found wells of most deliciously cold water, which has
   been dexterously covered, so that no person unacquainted with the stone
   in the wall, which might revolve, or might be removed, could have found
   the entrance to the spring.

   At the foot of some lofty range of mountains a reservoir receives the
   cooling streams which flow from melted snows. This reservoir was
   carefully guarded and shut out from all common entrance, in order that
   the king, alone, might enter there and might refresh himself during the
   scorching heat. Now such is the Christian's heart. It is a spring kept
   for Christ. Oh, I would that it were always so! Oh, how often do we
   pollute the Lord's altar! How frequently, my Soul, do you let in
   intruders? Alas, how common it is for us to be feasting other friends
   and shutting the door against Him.

   How often do we keep Him waiting in the street, while we are
   entertaining some barbarian who is passing by, who offers us his kiss
   but is meanwhile stabbing us with his right hand? Christian Brothers
   and Sisters, I appeal to your experience. Have you not to mourn
   frequently that you are not so much for Christ as you could wish to be?
   Though you recognize the truth of the text--you are not your own but
   are bought with a price--do you feel its force as you ought to do, in
   the actions which you perform for Christ? Are they all wholly for Him?
   Could you take for your motto, "All for

   Jesus"?

   Could you feel that, whether you buy or sell, whether you read or pray,
   whether you go out in the world or come back to your home, that Jesus,
   only, is the one Object on whom your heart is set and for whom your
   life is spent? Blessed are they, those virgin souls, who where ever the
   Lamb does lead, from

   His footsteps never depart! Thrice happy are they who wear the white
   robe unsoiled by contact with the world! Thrice blessed are they who
   can say, "Let Him kiss me with the kisses of His lips, for His love is
   better than wine!" Every Christian should feel that he is God's
   man--that he has God's stamp on him--and he should be able to say with
   Paul, "From henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear in my body the
   marks of the Lord Jesus."

   But I think there is another idea prominent and it is that of
   security--security to the inner life. "A garden enclosed." The wild
   boar out of the wood shall not break in there, neither shall the little
   foxes spoil the vines. "A fountain shut up." The bulls of Bashan shall
   not muddy her streams with their furious feet--neither shall the wild
   beast of Lebanon come there to drink. "A fountain sealed." No putrid
   streams shall foul her springs. Her water shall be kept clear and
   living. Her fountains shall never be filled up with stones. Oh, how
   sure and safe is the inner life of the Believer!

   Satan does not know where it is, for "our life is hid with Christ." The
   world cannot touch it. It seeks to overthrow it with troubles, and
   trials, and persecutions, but we are covered with the eternal wings and
   are safe from fear of evil. How can earthly trials reach the Spirit? As
   well might a man try to strike a soul with a stone, as to destroy the
   Spirit with afflictions. Surely in the floods of great waters they
   shall not come near unto Him. He has placed us in the secret place of
   the tabernacles of the Most High. In His pavilion has He hidden us and
   in a high rock has He secured us. As a castle preserves the besieged
   and as the ramparts keep those who find refuge behind them, even so
   munitions of stupendous rock your dwelling place shall be.

   "Who is he that shall harm you," when God is your protector? "No weapon
   that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that rises
   against you in judgment shall You condemn." No temptation shall be able
   to destroy the purity of the life within. No crushing weights of doubts
   shall be able to take away the vital principle from that new source of
   strength. If all the powers of earth and Hell could combine, and in
   their uttermost fury, assault the Spirit in its weakest hour, that
   immortal principle must still exist--it would boldly defy them all and
   triumph over every one of them. For He who gave it pledged His life for
   its preservation.

   The Spirit in the Christian is a spark of the Godhead and till the
   Godhead dies, the Christian's inner life can never expire. We are
   immortal, even though we are mortal. Within this outward crust that
   perishes there is a soul which endures and within that soul which
   endures there is a something which might outlast even the soul
   itself--a part of the Being of God, the indwelling Holy One of Israel,
   who is Himself most surely Divine. "God dwells in us and we in Him." We
   are one with Christ, even as Christ is one with the Father, and
   therefore as imperishable through Christ's life as Christ Himself.
   Truly may we rejoice in the fact that "because He lives we shall live
   also."

   Once more only. I think in looking at the text you receive the thought
   of unity. You notice, it is but one garden--"a garden enclosed." "A
   garden." It is but one spring and that is shut up. It is but one
   fountain. So the inner life of the Christian is but one. There is the
   old life which still survives--that old death, rather--the body of sin
   and death, struggling against the Law of life which God has put into
   His members, but this has no kinship with the Life Divine. It is alone
   and knows no relationship with earth. There is but one Life for all
   Christians--either we have it, or we are dead. There are degrees of
   operation but it is the same God.

   There are differences of administration, but it is the same Spirit that
   quickens. We may not, all of us, have "one Lord, one faith and one
   Baptism." I wish we had. I would that the two Baptisms would cease, and
   that once again the Church would recognize and practice the Baptism of
   Believers. But we do have one Spirit, otherwise we are not Christians.
   I may dissent myself as much as I please from another man who is in
   Christ--I cannot do that, however, without sin. But dissociate myself
   as I may, I must be one with him, for the Life that is in him is in me.
   The same Life which quickens me, if I am in Christ, dwells also in him.

   When I hear strict communion talked of, it reminds me of a little
   finger which was washed very clean, and therefore thought the rest of
   the body too filthy to have fellowship with it. So it took a piece of
   red tape and bound it tightly round itself, that the life-blood might
   not flow from itself into the rest of the body. What do you think,
   Brethren? Why, as long as that little finger was itself alive, the
   pulsations and the motions of the blood went from it to all the rest of
   the body, and that little piece of red tape was but a ridiculous sham.
   It did not affect anything. It had no influence. It only enabled the
   little finger boastfully to glory and perhaps to earn for itself the
   sad distinction--"These are they that separate themselves." But the
   blood flowed on unimpeded and the nerves and sinews felt the common
   life-throb still.

   They forgot, when they denied fellowship in the outward act of eating
   bread and drinking wine, that the essential spirit of communion was far
   too spiritual to be thus restrained--it had overleaped their boundary
   and was gone! The only way in which a Christian can leave off communing
   with all other Christians is by leaving off being a Christian. Thus can
   the finger leave off communing with the rest of the body--by rotting
   away and no way else, as long as it is alive.

   Communion is the life-blood of the soul. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit
   that quickens the body of the Church and that Holy Spirit will go into
   every member. You may try to check Him by Church decrees, or to stop
   Him by your trust-deeds and your ordinances, that such-and-such a
   Church shall never be loosed from the bands of ancestral bigotry. But,
   by God's Grace, the Church's life will beat freely through all the
   members of the Church's fellowship--and communion will go to all who
   are in Christ.

   There is but one garden, but one spring, but one sealed fountain. And
   if you have it in your heart and I have it in mine, there is a
   relationship between you and me that is as near as if you and I had the
   same soul, for you and I have the same Spirit. If you could imagine two
   bodies quickened by the very same mind, what a close connection would
   that be! But here are hundreds of bodies, hundreds of souls, quickened
   by the same Spirit. Brethren, not only ought we to love one another,
   but the love of Christ constrains us, so that we cannot resist the
   impulse. We do, indeed, love each other in Christ Jesus.

   II. I shall now need your attention, while with brevity I try to open
   the second text, which presents a decided contrast, because it deals
   not so much with the inner life as with the active life which goes
   abroad into all the deeds of the Christian in the world and is the
   natural outgoing of the life within.

   First, notice that in contradistinction to our first thought of
   secrecy, you have in the text manifestation. "A fountain of gardens."
   Everybody can see a fountain which runs streaming through many gardens,
   making deserts fertile. "A well of living waters." Whatever the
   traveler does not see, when he is riding along on a thirsty day, he is
   sure to see the fountain. If there is one anywhere, he is certain to
   observe it. "And streams from Lebanon." So that any passerby in the
   valley, looking up the side of the mountain, will see by the clusters
   of trees which skirt the stream where the stream is.

   Or, if it is a smaller brook, just as sometimes in Cumberland and
   Westmoreland, on a rainy day you see the mountain suddenly marked with
   streaks of silver all down its brown sides, where the brooks are
   rippling--so the Christian becomes like the streams leaping down
   Lebanon's steep sides, clearly perceived even from a distance--manifest
   to the most casual observer.

   Now, Brethren, this is what you and I ought to be. No man ought to
   court publicity for his virtue, or notoriety for his zeal. But, at the
   same time, it is a sin to be always seeking to hide that which God has
   bestowed upon us for the good of others. A Christian is not to be a
   city in a valley--he is to be "a city set upon a hill." He is not to be
   a candle put under a bushel, but a candle in a candlestick, giving
   light to all. Retirement may be lovely in the eyes of some, and the
   hiding of oneself is doubtless a blessed thing, but the hiding of
   Christ in us can never be justified. The keeping back of the Truth of
   God which is precious to ourselves, is a sin against our kind, and an
   offense against God.

   Those of you who are of a nervous temperament and of retired habits of
   life, must take care that you do not too much indulge your natural
   propensity, lest you should be useless to the Church. Seek in the name
   of Him who was not ashamed of you to do some little violence to your
   feelings and tell to others what Christ has told you. Keep not the
   secret--it is too precious--it too much concerns the vital interests of
   man. Speak, if you can, not with trumpet tongue, yet speak with a still
   small voice! If the pulpit must not be your tribune, if the press may
   not carry on its wings your words, yet say, as Peter and John did,
   "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I unto you."

   And speak, too, as you can--gently to ones, if not loudly to
   twenties--quietly to twos, if not publicly to scores. By Sychar's Well
   talk to the Samaritan woman, if you cannot on the mountain preach the
   sermon. In the house, if not in the temple. In the field, if not upon
   the exchange. In the midst of your own household, if you cannot in the
   midst of the great family of man. At any rate, hide not your
   talent--wrap it not up. "It is but one," you say. So much the more
   reason why you should make the greater use of that one. Conceal it
   not--bring it out--trade with it. And so you shall multiply the talent
   and you shall bring in good interest to your Lord and Master.

   The inner life is secret--mind that you have this inner mystery. But
   out of the secret emanates the manifest. The darkness becomes the
   mother of light. From the dark mines comes the blazing coal. Oh, see to
   it that from all that is hidden, and secret, and mysterious, there
   comes out the plain and the manifest, that men may see the holiness,
   truthfulness, and zeal of God in your life!

   But clearly enough, again, we have in the second text, in opposition to
   the separation of the first, diffusiveness. The garden was enclosed
   before. Now it is "a fountain of gardens." The well was shut up, now it
   is a well of living waters. Before we had the fountain sealed, now we
   have streams dashing down the sides of Lebanon. So a Christian is to be
   separate in his inner life. But in the outer manifestations of that
   inner life, he is to mingle for good among his fellow men. It was usual
   in Romish countries for women who wished to be especially holy, to make
   recluses of themselves.

   In the Church of St. Roche, in Paris, there was a small building
   erected on the side of the Church. The only opening was a little
   grating, through which the necessities of life were passed. Within this
   narrow cell, there lived for eighty years and died, I think, at the age
   of ninety-six, a woman doubtless devout but certainly superstitious.
   There she passed her life. The only sound she heard was the tramp of
   the worshippers upon the Church pavement and the chant of the daily
   service. But she lived there, thinking she was serving God by being
   separate from men.

   That is not the separation of the New Testament. We are to be separate
   from sinners, as Christ was, and whoever went among sinners more than
   He did? We are to be healthy, and by that health separate from the
   leper. We are to be clean, and by that cleanness separate from the
   filthy. But we are to go among them. We are to visit. We are to
   distribute ourselves what Christ has given to us. If we keep ourselves
   altogether apart, we shall be useless to our fellow men. We shall be
   like stagnant pools--we shall grow putrid by degrees. We must let the
   streams flow abroad. We must seek to give to others what Christ has
   given to us.

   Now, some of you who keep yourselves separate in that sense, may I beg
   you to see if there is no mission of mercy for you? Go out among them
   as physicians in the midst of the sick, as torchbearers in the midst of
   darkness. Go out as losers of the bonds among the captives. As openers
   of prison doors among those that are bound and He who has given you the
   true principle within, which is, and must be shut up, will bless the
   outgoings of your zeal, both in the morning and in the evening, and
   cause that, watering others, your own soul shall be watered, too.

   Briefly we are obliged to speak on each of these points. But notice,
   thirdly, that in opposition to the sacredness of the first text we have
   in the second verse an unlimited freeness, especially in that last
   expression--"streams from Lebanon." What can be freer than the brook,
   which leaps along the mountainside? There the bird wets its wings.
   There the red deer comes to drink, and even that wild beast of Lebanon,
   of which we read in the Book of the Kings, comes there and without let
   or hindrance slakes its thirst. What can be freer than the rivulet
   singing with liquid notes flowing down the glen?

   It belongs to no one. It is free to all. Whosoever passes by, whether
   peer or peasant, may stoop there and refresh himself from the mountain
   stream. So is it with you, Christian. Carry about with you a piety
   which you do not wish to keep for yourself. A light loses none of its
   own luster when others are lit by its flame. Remember, you shall earn
   riches by giving riches and in this sense giving away shall be an
   increase of your wealth! I know some who are in an ill sense, like
   fountains shut up. They love the doctrine of election but there is one
   doctrine they love better and that is, the doctrine of exclusion.

   They love to think they are shut in, but they feel quite as much
   delight that others are shut out. Their conversation is always flavored
   with the thought of shutting others out. They are told that in
   such-and-such a Church there has been a large increase. Well, they hope
   they are genuine--by which they mean that they do not believe they are.
   A young Believer begins to tell them something of his joys. Well, they
   don't like to be too fast in pronouncing an opinion--by which they mean
   they would not like one more to get in than should, and they are half
   afraid that perhaps some may overstep the bounds of election and get
   saved who should not be.

   Well, Brethren, I love the doctrine of election. I love to think that
   the garden is enclosed, but I love in my own life to exemplify the
   equally precious Truth of God of the freeness of the Gospel. So that if
   I speak to any it shall not be to discourage them, but to encourage
   them--not to say, "Get you gone!" But "Come, and welcome!" Depart, you
   cursed," is nothing to do with me--my business is to say, "Come, you
   blessed." I would rather go to the door and say, "Come in, you blessed
   of the Lord, why do you stand outside?" than slam it in a sinner's face
   with, "What have you to do here?"

   No, we must be shut up in the inner life. But let every wall be broken
   down as to the outer life. We must be hidden springs within, but let us
   be sweetly flowing rivulets without--giving drink to every passerby.

   And not to detain you long, you will notice that, while we had in the
   other text the idea of security, in connection with that, we have here,
   in this text, the idea of approach. The garden was shut up--that was to
   keep it. There are no walls here, so that all may come to it. The
   streams were shut up before. Here it is an open well. The fountain was
   sealed in the first verse--here it is a flowing stream. All this is to
   teach us this--the way God keeps His people in security is not by
   shutting out their enemies from attacking them. But while laying them
   open to temptation and attack, He yet sustains them.

   It is not much to preserve oneself behind a wall which cannot be
   scaled. But to stand where arrows are flying thick as hail, where
   lances are being pushed with fury, where the sword-cuts are falling on
   every part--to stand, I say, invulnerable, invincible, immortal--this
   is to wear a Divine Life which cannot be conquered by human power! Such
   is the Christian. We are to pray, "lead us not into temptation." But
   indeed, we often are tempted, notwithstanding our prayer. God will put
   us where we must be tempted--put us where we must be tried--if we are
   not tried, there is no honor to Him. And if we are not tempted, then
   where is the glory to the Divine Grace that delivers us out of
   temptations?

   The Lord does not put His plants into a hot-house, as some gardeners
   do. No, He sets them out in the open air and if the frost is coming, He
   says, "Ah, but no frost can kill them and they will be all the sturdier
   in the summer, for the cold in the winter." He does not shelter them,
   either, from the heat of the sun, or from the cold of night--for in
   this world we must have tribulation and we must have much of it,
   too--for it is through much tribulation we inherit the kingdom. But
   what God does to His people is this. He keeps them in tribulation,
   preserves them in temptation and brings them joyfully out of all their
   trials.

   So, Christian, you may rejoice in your security. But you must not think
   that you are not to be attacked. You are a stream from Lebanon, to be
   dashed down many a cascade, to be broken over many a rough rock, to be
   stopped up with many a huge stone, to be impeded by many a fallen tree.
   But you are to dash forward with the irresistible force of God,
   sweeping everything away, till you find at last the place where shall
   be your perfect rest.

   And last of all, in opposition to the unity of which I spoke, we have
   in our second text great diversity. You have "a fountain," not of a
   garden but "of gardens." You have a well but it is a well of living
   waters. You have not a stream but streams--streams from Lebanon. So a
   Christian is to do good in all sorts of ways and his fruits are to be
   of many kinds. He is to be like the trees of Paradise, which bear
   twelve manner of fruits. The Christian is to have all sorts of Divine
   Graces. "Whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever
   things are of good repute," he is to have all these.

   It is an old proverb that a man may have too many irons in the fire.
   But it depends upon what fire it is. For if it is God's fire, put all
   the irons in it. A man may attempt too much, they say--but not for
   Christ. If you should attempt great things and have great faith, you
   shall succeed in all that you attempt. There seems to be a fear among
   some Christian men either of doing too much themselves, or letting
   other people do too much. And I know some to whom that text might
   almost be applied, "They have the key of the kingdom of Heaven but they
   neither enter themselves and they that would, they hinder."

   Not content to refuse the burden for themselves--they will not even
   touch it with one of their little fingers--but they discourage others
   from carrying the burden, too. Well, we are not afraid as these are.
   Blessed be God, if there is a trench to be filled up, let us struggle
   about who shall lead the way. If there is a rampart to be climbed, if
   there is no other man to throw the irons over with the scaling-ladder,
   let your minister attempt the deed and lead the van, for he is well
   assured that there are many here who would jostle with him and say,
   "Let me go first. Let me serve my Master. Let me live or let me die, if
   I may but glorify Him."

   What? Bring forth for Christ a little shriveled cluster? Climb to the
   topmost bough--to a cluster which the very birds of Heaven will not
   deign to touch, because it is too little even for their appetites? No!
   Rather let us have every bough weighed down with clusters, like those
   of Eshcol, which will take two ordinary men to carry, but which we can
   bear in rich profusion, because the life of the Spirit of God is in us!

   We are a race of little doers, of little givers, of little thinkers, of
   little believers. O God, raise us up again giants in these days! Give
   us again the consecrated men who shall stand upon the sword like the
   old Roman and say, "For God I devote myself. To Christ I give body,
   soul and spirit, and if I am offered up upon the sacrifice of your
   faith, I joy and rejoice with you all." Oh, if the fountain, the secret
   fountain, were better seen to, I think there would be more of these
   outward streams. And if the sealed well were better guarded, we should
   see more of these rapid streams from Lebanon, which would make glad the
   people of God and the world at large.

   And now, how many of you have the secret spring within you? If your
   soul is not renewed by Divine Grace you cannot do good. "Except a man
   is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." No man enters fully
   into discipleship with Christ till the water, as well as the Spirit has
   been reverently received--"Except a man is born of water and of the
   Spirit you cannot enter the kingdom of Heaven." But these two things
   being done, being born of water and of the Spirit, go forth to show to
   others the mystery, the fellowship of the mystery--to make all men know
   that God has appeared unto us in Christ Jesus, reconciling the world
   unto Himself, not imputing their iniquities.

   Preach of Christ when you know Christ, but not till then. Let the
   streams flow out where you have the inner fountain, but not till then.
   Sad reflection! There are some of you that have it not. Oh, if you have
   it not, you perish. You cannot get it of yourselves. He alone can give
   it. You are in His hands to give it to you. Oh, may your longings end
   in groaning today, and may you groan to God, "Lord! Renew me, Lord,
   cause me to be born again!" And those groans will be proofs that He has
   begun the good work, and those longings shall be evidence that there is
   a well in you, though it is a well shut up--a well shut up even from
   yourself.

   God grant that you may seek and find through Jesus Christ. And to Him
   be glory, forever and ever. Amen.

                       A Voice from the Hartley Colliery

   A Sermon

   (No. 432)

   Delivered on Thursday Evening, January 30th, 1862, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "If a man die, shall he live again?--Job 14:14.

   ONCE MORE THE LORD has spoken. Once again the voice of Providence has
   proclaimed "All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as
   the flower of grass." O sword of the Lord, when wilt thou rest and be
   quiet? Wherefore these repeated warnings? Why doth the Lord so
   frequently and so terribly sound an alarm? Is it not because our drowsy
   spirits will not awaken to the realities of death? We fondly persuade
   ourselves that we are immortal, that though a thousand may fall at our
   side, and ten thousand at our right hand, yet death shall not come nigh
   unto us. We flatter ourselves that if we must die, yet the evil day is
   far hence. If we be sixty, we presumptuously reckon upon another twenty
   years of life; and the man of eighty, tottering upon his staff,
   remembering that some few have survived to the close of a century, sees
   no reason why he should not do the same. If man cannot kill death, he
   tries at least to bury him alive; and since death will intrude himself
   in man's pathway, we endeavor to shut our eyes to the ghastly object.
   God in providence is continually filling our path with tombs. With
   kings and princes there is too much forgetfulness of the world to come;
   God has, therefore, spoken to them. They were but few in number; one
   death might be sufficient in their case. That one death of a beloved
   and illustrious prince will leave its mark on courts and palaces. As
   for the workers, they also are wishful to put far from them the thought
   of the coffin and the shroud: God has spoken to them also. There were
   many; one death would not be sufficient; it was absolutely necessary
   that there should be many victims, or we should have disregarded the
   warning. Two hundred witnesses cry to us from the pit's mouth, a solemn
   fellowship of preachers all using the same text, "Prepare to meet thy
   God, O Israel!" If God had not thus spoken by the destruction of many,
   we should have said, "Ah, it is a common occurrence; there are
   frequently such accidents as these?" The rod would have failed in its
   effect had it smitten less severely. The awful calamity at the Hartley
   Colliery has at least had this effect, that men are talking of death in
   all our streets. Oh! Father of thy people, send forth thy Holy Spirit
   in richer abundance, that by this solemn chastisement higher ends may
   be answered than merely attracting our thoughts to our latter end. Oh!
   may hearts be broken, may eyes be made to weep for sin, may follies be
   renounced, may Christ be accepted, and may spiritual life be given as
   the result of temporal death to the many who now sleep in their
   untimely graves in Earsdon churchyard.

   This text is appropriate to the occasion, but God alone knoweth how
   applicable the discourse may be to some here present; yes, to young
   hearts little dreaming that there is but a step between them and death;
   to aged persons, who as yet have not set their house in order, but who
   must do it, for they shall die and not live. We will take the question
   of the text, and answer it upon Scriptural grounds. "If a man die,
   shall he live again?" NO!--YES!

   I. We answer the question first with a "No." He shall not live again
   here; he shall not again mingle with his fellows, and repeat the life
   which death has brought to a close. This is true of him with regard to
   himself, and equally true with regard to his neighbors. Shall he live
   again for himself? No. Shall he live again for his household? No.

   1. Dwell for a moment on the first thought. "If a man die, shall he
   live again." Shall he live for himself. No; if he hath lived and died a
   sinner, that sinful life of his shall never be repeated. Sinner, thou
   mayest empty the cups of drunkenness in this world throughout a long
   life, but thou shalt never have another season to spend in
   intoxication! Thou who hast broken through all the bounds of morality,
   thou mayest live in this life debauched, depraved, and devilish, but
   death shall put an end to thy career of lust. Let the cup be sweet; it
   is the last time thou shalt ever drink it. If there be any pleasures in
   sin, thou shalt never taste them again. The sweets shall be over once
   for all, and at the bottom thou shalt find the bitter dregs which shall
   be gall for ever. Once thou shalt insult high heaven, but not twice.
   Once shalt thou have space to blaspheme; once shalt thou have time
   proudly to array thyself in self-righteousness; once shalt thou have
   power to despise the Christ who is the Savior of men, but not twice.
   The longsuffering of God shall wait for thee through thy life of
   provocations; but thou shalt not be born again into this world; thou
   shalt not a second time defile its air with blasphemies, nor blot its
   beauties with impiety. Thou shalt not live again to forget the God who
   hath daily loaded thee with mercies. Thou hast thy daily bread now; the
   clothes that are on thy back shelter thee from the cold; thou goest to
   thy house, and thou hast comforts and mercies there, but like the swine
   which feed beneath the oak forgetful of the green bough which yields
   the acorn, or like the brute which is content to eat the grass, but
   never thanks the sun or the cloud which nourished the pasture, so thou
   livest in this world, forgetful of the God who made thee, in whom thou
   livest, and movest, and hast thy being. In this life thou art
   unthankful but thou shalt have no further opportunity for this
   ingratitude. All thy candles shall go out in eternal darkness. There
   shall be no more dainty meals for thee; no more joyous holidays, no
   more quiet slumbers. Every mercy shall be taken from thee. That which
   makes life desirable shall be removed if thou diest impenitent, till
   thou shalt hate thine existence and count it thy highest blessing if
   thou couldst cease to be. Thou shalt not live again, I say, to treat
   thy God worse than the ox treateth its owner. The ass knoweth his
   master's crib, but thou knowest not, though thou shalt know, for this
   is the last season in which thou shalt play the brute. My dear hearers,
   many of you have something more than the common mercies of God, you
   have his Word, Sabbath after Sabbath, preached in your ears. I may say
   truthfully concerning you who attend this house of prayer, that you
   hear one who, when he fails for want of power, fails not for want of
   will to do you good; one who has not shunned to warn you, and to preach
   in all simplicity the whole counsel of God, so far as he has been
   taught it by the Holy Spirit. If you die you shall not live again to
   stifle the voice of your conscience, and to quench the Spirit of God.
   You shall have no more Sabbaths to mis-spend when this life is over.
   There shall be no church bells for you, after your knell is tolled. No
   affectionate voice shall beseech you in Christ's stead to be reconciled
   to God. No warning hand shall point you to the cross; no loving lip
   shall cry, "This is the way; walk ye in it." Ye have your last warnings
   now sinners; if ye reject them ye shall have no more. Ye hear in this
   life your last invitations; despise them, and the door shall be shut in
   your face for ever. Christ is lifted up before your eyes, look to him
   now and live; refuse him, and there remaineth no more sacrifice for
   sin, and no other life in which you may lay hold of him.

   Fix'd is their everlasting state,

   Could man repent, 'tis then too late;

   Justice has closed mercy's door,

   And God's longsuffering is no more.

   Here you may have a mother to weep for you; a wife to pray for you,
   friends who will counsel you; the blessings of a Christian country, an
   open Bible, and a house of prayer, but it is your last time. Now or
   never; now or never. Lost in time; lost in eternity; saved now, saved
   for ever. Sinner, it is thy last turn. Will thou choose to be damned?
   Then damned thou art without hope! May God save thee now, and saved
   thou art beyond fear of perishing. But it is thy last, thine only
   opportunity. Where the tree falleth there it must lie for ever.

   "Return, O wanderer to thy home,

   'Tis madness to delay;

   There are no pardons in the tomb,

   And brief is mercy's day.

   Return! Return!"

   Solemnly let us say it, awful as it appears, it is well that the sinner
   should not live again in this world. "Oh!" you will say, when you are
   dying, "if I could but live again, I would not sin as I once did." When
   you are in the pit of hell, perhaps your pride will lead you to imagine
   that if you could come back to earth again you would be another man.
   Ah! but you would not be so! Unless you had a new heart and a right
   spirit, if you could live again, you would live as you did before. Keep
   the fountain unchanged, and the same streams will flow. Let the cause
   remain, and the same effects will follow. If the lost spirits could
   escape from hell, they would sin as they did before; if they could
   again listen to the gospel they would again reject it, for he that is
   filthy will be filthy still; the flames of hell shall work no change in
   character; for they have no sanctifying influence; they punish, but
   they do not cleanse. Sinners, it is well that you will not live again,
   for if you did you would but increase your condemnation. There would be
   two lives of sin, of rejection of Christ, of unbelief, and, if it were
   possible, hell would then be less tolerable for you than it shall be
   now. Oh! my poor dying hearers, by the corpses in the dark smothering
   gas of Hartley Pit, I pray you be awakened, for your death-hour is
   hastening on, and you have but to-day in which to find a Savior.

   "Sinner beware.--the axe of death,

   Is raised and aimed at thee:

   Awhile thy Maker spares thy breath,

   Beware, O barren tree."

   Every time you hear your clock tick, let it say to you, "Now or never,
   NOW OR NEVER, NOW OR NEVER."

   In the case of the child of God, it is the same, so far as he himself
   is concerned, when he dies he shall not live again. No more shall he
   bitterly repent of sin; no more lament the plague of his own heart, and
   tremble under a sense of deserved wrath. No more shall the godly pitman
   suffer for righteousness' sake, despising the sneer of his comrades.
   The battle is once fought: it is not to be repeated. If God hath safely
   guided the ship across the sea and brought it to its desired haven, it
   casteth anchor for ever, and goeth not out a second time into the
   storm. Like those earnest Methodist miners, we have one life of
   usefulness, of service, of affliction, of temptation; one life in which
   to glorify God on earth in blessing our fellow-men; one life in which
   faith may be tried and love made perfect; one life in which we may
   prove the faithfulness of God in providence; and one life in which we
   may see Christ triumphant over sin in our mortal bodies, but we shall
   not return to the scene of conflict.

   Brethren is it not a mercy for you and for me if we be in Christ, that
   our furnace is not to be re-lit? Oh, brethren, it were unkind for us to
   wish back the dead! Ah, when we think of those brethren, those men of
   God, who in the pit held prayer meeting when they knew that the fatal
   gas would soon take away their lives; though we look at their weeping
   widows and their sorrowing children, it were wrong to wish them back
   again. What would any of us who fear God think, if we were once in
   heaven? Would not the very suggestion of return, though it were to the
   most faithful spouse and best-beloved children, be a cruelty? What,
   bring back again to battle the victor who wears the crown! Drag back to
   the storm and the tempest, the mariner who has gained the strand! What,
   bring me back again to pain and sorrow, to temptation, and to sin? No.
   Blessed be thou, O God, that all the wishes of friends shall not
   accomplish this, for we shall be

   "Far from this world of grief and sin,

   With God, eternally shut in."

   This world is not so lovely as to tempt us away from heaven. Here we
   are strangers and foreigners; here we have no abiding city; but we seek
   one to come. There is one wilderness, but we bless God there are not
   two. There is one Jordan to be crossed, but there is not another. There
   is one season when we must walk by faith and not by sight, and be fed
   with manna from heaven; but blessed be God there is not another, for
   after that comes the Canaan--the rest which remaineth for the people of
   God. What man among ye, immersed in the cares of business, would desire
   two lives? Who, that is tired to-day with the world's noise, and vexed
   with its temptations; who that has come from a bed of sickness; who
   that is conscious of sin, would wish to leave the haven when once it is
   reached? As well might galley-slave long to return to his oar, or
   captive to his dungeon? No, blessed be God, the souls which have
   ascended from the colliery to glow are not to leave their starry
   spheres, but rest in Christ for ever.

   2. But now we pass to the other thought under this first head. If a man
   die, shall he live again?" Shall he live for others? No. The sinner
   shall not live to do damage to others. If there were any fathers who
   perished in the pit who had neglected the training of their children,
   they cannot live again to educate them for Christ. If there were any
   there (we hope there were not, and there is a hopeful sign, for I am
   told that there was not a single public-house within a mile of the
   village), but if there were there any who by their ill example taught
   others to sin, they shall never do it again. If there were any there
   who led others astray, by bold speeches against God, they have done
   once for all their life's-mischiefs. And so with each of us to-night.
   Do I speak to one here who is living a useless life; a tree planted in
   rich soil but bearing no fruit; a creature made by God but rendering
   him no service? Do I not speak to some such to-night? I know I do. You
   cannot be charged with outward vice, or with positive irregularity of
   conduct, but still it may be said of you, "I was an hungred and ye gave
   me no meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink; naked and ye clothed
   me not; sick and in prison and ye visited me not." Ye have not done it
   unto one of the least of these his brethren, and ye have not done it
   unto Christ. It is not necessary to do anything in order to be lost.
   The way to perdition is very simple; it is only a little matter of
   neglect. "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation." Well,
   sinner, this is the last life of negligence that you shall ever spend;
   the very last season when you shall turn upon your heel and say, "Ha!
   ha! there is nothing in it!" The last time in which you shall put off
   the messenger by saying, "When I have a more convenient season I will
   send for thee." The neglect of our own souls is a most solemn mischief
   to others. When others see that we neglect, they take courage and
   neglect too.

   "One sickly sheep infests the flock,

   And poisons all the rest."

   But there are others whose example is bad. What sorrow it is to notice
   men who carry the infection of sin wherever they go about them. In some
   of our villages, and especially in our towns, we have men who are
   reeking dung-hills of corruption. To put them by the side of a youth
   for an hour would be almost as dangerous as to make that youth walk
   through Nebuchadnezzar's fiery furnace. Men who, as Saul breathed out
   threatenings, breathe out lasciviousness. Ah! do I speak to such a
   wretch? It is thy last rebellion--thy last revolt. Thou shalt never do
   this again. Never again shalt thou lead others down to hell, and drag
   them to the pit with thee. Remember that. And some there be who not
   only by example, but by overt teaching drive others astray. We have
   still, in this enlightened Christian land, wretches who boast the name
   of "infidel lecturer;" whose business it is to pervert men's minds by
   hard speeches against the majesty of heaven. Let them labor hard if
   they mean to subvert Jehovah's throne, for they have little time to do
   it in. Well may the enemies of the Lord of Hosts be desperately in
   earnest, for they have an awful work to do, and if they consider the
   puny strength with which they go forth to battle against the Judge of
   all the earth, and the brevity of the time that can be given to the
   struggle, well may they work and toil. This is their only time their
   sure damnation draweth nigh. Hushed shall be their high words; cold
   shall be their hot and furious hearts. God shall crush them in his
   anger, and destroy them in his hot displeasure. If a man die, he shall
   not live again to scatter hemlock seed, and sow sin in furrows. I do
   not know what your life is my friend. You have stepped in here
   to-night; it is not often you are in a place of worship, but listen
   now. You know that to your family you are sometimes a terror, and
   always an ill example. Ah, you are a co-worker with Satan now, but God
   shall put you where you shall do no more hurt to that fair child of
   yours; where you shall not teach your boy to drink; where you shall not
   instil into your daughter's mind unholy thoughts. The time shall come,
   masters, when you shall be taken away from those men who imitate you in
   your evil ways. The time shall be over with you working-man yonder, you
   shall not much longer jeer at the righteous, and sneer at the godly.
   You will find it hard work to laugh at the saints when you get into
   hell. You will find when God comes to deal with you, and your life is
   over, that it will be utterly impossible for you then to call them
   fools, for you will be thinking yourself the greatest fool that ever
   was, that you did not, like them, seek first the kingdom of God and his
   righteousness. Well, jeer and joke, and point the finger, and slander,
   and persecute as you may; it is the last time, and you shall never have
   another opportunity to mock the saints. O remember, it were better for
   you that a mill-stone were about your neck, and that you were cast into
   the depths of the sea than that you should thus offend Christ's little
   ones. Well, I think we may say it is a great mercy that the sinner
   shall not live again in this sense. What, bring him back again--that
   old drunkard of the village tap-room, restore him to life? No, no; good
   men breathed more freely when he was gone. What, bring back that vile
   old blasphemer who used to curse God? No, no; he vexed the righteous
   long enough; let him abide in his place. What, bring back that lewd,
   lascivious wretch to seduce others and lead them astray? What, bring
   back that thief to train others to his evil deeds? Bring back that
   self-righteous man who was always speaking against the gospel, and
   striving to prejudice other men's minds against gospel light? No, no.
   With all our love of one man, the love of many is stronger still, and
   we could not wish for the temporary and seeming good of one, to permit
   him to go raging, among others. Natural benevolence might suggest even
   the loosing of a lion as a creature, but a greater benevolence says,
   "No, let him be chained, or he will rend others." We might not wish to
   crush even a serpent. Let it live, it has its own sphere and its own
   enjoyment. But if the serpent creep among men, where it can bite and
   infuse its poison into human veins, let it die. Without compunction we
   say it,--"It were better that one man should die for the nation, that
   the whole nation perish not." If a man die then, as far as others are
   concerned, he shall not live again to curse his kind.

   And now, me remind you that it is the same with the saint, "If a man
   die, shall he live again?" No. This is our season to pray for our
   fellow-men, and it is a season which shall never return. Mother, you
   shall never come back to pray for your daughters and your sons again!
   Ministers, this is your time to preach. We shall never have an
   opportunity of being God's ambassadors anymore. Oh! when I sometimes
   think of this, I am ashamed that I can preach with dry eyes, and that
   sobs do not choke my utterance. Methinks if I were lying upon my dying
   bed, I might often say, "O Lord, would that I could preach again, and
   once more warn poor souls." I think Baxter says he never came out of
   his pulpit without sighing, because he had played his part so ill, and
   yet who ever preached more earnestly than he? And so, at times when we
   have felt the weight of souls, yet in looking back, we have thought we
   did not feel it as we should; and when we have stood by the corpse of
   one of our own hearers, we have had the reflection, "Would that I could
   have talked more personally, and spoken more earnestly, to this man!" I
   often feel that if God should ever permit me to say I am clear of the
   blood of you all, it is about as much as I can ever hope to have, for
   that must be heaven to a man, to feel that God has delivered him out of
   his ministry, it is such an awful thing to be responsible before God
   for the souls of men. "If the watchman warn them not, they shall
   perish, but their blood will I require at the watchman's hands." And
   so, remember, it is with each one of you. Now is your time to rescue
   the fallen, to teach the ignorant, to carry the lambs in your bosom, or
   to restore the wandering; now is your season for liberality to the
   Church, for care of the poor, for consecration to Christ's service, and
   for devotion to his cause. If there could be sorrow among the spirits
   that are crowding around the throne of Christ, methinks it would be
   this, that they had not labored more abundantly, and were not more
   instant in season and out of season in doing good. If those godly
   pitmen over whom we mourn tonight, had not done their utmost while they
   were here, the deficiency could never be made up. Let me commend to you
   the example of some of those who were in the pit, praying and exhorting
   their fellow men just as they were all in the last article of death.
   They were Primitive Methodists. Let their names clothe Primitive
   Methodism with eternal honor! I conceive that in employing poor
   unlettered men to preach, the plan of the Primitive Methodists is New
   Testament and Scriptural policy. Such methods of usefulness we have
   endeavored to pursue, and hope to do so yet more fully. The Primitive
   Methodists think that a man may preach who never went to college; that
   a man may preach to his fellow-miners even though he cannot speak
   grammatically; and hence they do not excite their ministers to labor
   after literary attainments, but after the souls of men; and the local
   preachers are chosen solely and wholly for their power to speak from
   the heart, and to make their fellow-men feel. We should have done more
   for London if we had not been so squeamish. Real Primitive Methodism we
   have seen in London, in the person of Mr. Richard Weaver; and if you
   would put a score of the ministers who have preached in the theatres
   altogether, they would not have made one such a man as Richard Weaver,
   for real effect upon the masses. And yet what teaching had he, and what
   wisdom? None, but that he feels the power of God in his own soul, and
   speaks out of his heart, roughly and rudely, but still mightily to
   others. We want all our Churches to feel that they must not say, "Who
   is John So-and-so? He is only a cobbler; he must not preach. What is
   Tom So-and-so? He is only a carpenter; why should he preach?" Ah, these
   are the men who shook the world; these are the men whom God used to
   destroy old Rome. With all our gettings, while we seek to get education
   in the ministry, we must take care that we do not despise those things
   that are not, which God shall make mightier than the things that are:
   and those base things which God hath chosen to stain the pride of human
   glorying, and to bring into contempt all the excellent of the earth. I
   know that I address some working men here. Working men, oh, that you
   knew Christ in your own hearts as they did in the Hartley pit! You see
   they had no preacher down there. Do not get the notion that you want a
   minister in order to come to Christ. Priestcraft is a thing we hate,
   and as you hate it too, we are quite one in that opinion. I preach the
   Word, but what am I more than you? If you can preach to edification, I
   pray you do so. Your poor brethren in the pit, though not set apart to
   that work, were yet as true priests unto the living God, and ministers
   for Christ, as any of us. So be you. Hasten to work while it is called
   to-day; gird up your loins and run the heavenly race for the sun is
   setting never to rise again upon this land.

   II. "If a man die shall he live again?" Yes, yes, that he shall. He
   does not die like a dog; he shall live again; not here, but in another
   and a better or a more terrible land. The soul, we know, never dies,
   but when it leaves the clay it mounts to sing with angels or descends
   to howl with fiends. The body itself shall live again. The corpses in
   the pit were some of them swollen with foul air; some of them could
   scarcely be recognized, but as the seed corn has not lost its vitality,
   shrivelled though it be, neither have those bodies. They are now sown,
   and they shall spring up either to bear the image of condemnation, or
   of immortality and life. Scattered to the winds of heaven, devoured of
   beasts, mixed with other substances and other bodies, yet every atom of
   the human body has been tracked by the eye of omniscience, and shall be
   gathered to its proper place by the hand of omnipotence. The Lord
   knoweth every particle of the bodies of them that are his. All men,
   whether they be righteous or wicked, shall certainly live again in the
   body, "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.
   This much cometh to all men through Christ, that all men have a
   resurrection. But more than that. They shall all live again in the
   eternal state; either for ever glorified with God in Christ, blessed
   with the holy angels, for ever shut in from all danger and alarm; or in
   that place appointed for banished spirits who have shut themselves out
   from God, and now find that God has shut them out from him. They shall
   live again, in weal or woe, in bliss or bane, in heaven or in hell. Now
   ye that are unconverted, think of this I pray you for a moment. Ye
   shall live again; let no one tempt you to believe the contrary.
   Whatever they shall say, and however speciously they may put it, mark
   this word--you shall not rot in the tomb for ever; there shall not be
   an end of you when they shall say "Earth to earth, dust to dust, and
   ashes to ashes." Ye shall live again. And hark thee, sinner; let me
   hold thee by the hand a moment; thy sins shall live again. They are not
   dead. Thou hast forgotten them, but God has not. Thou hast covered them
   over with the thick darkness of forgetfulness, but they are in his
   book, and the day shall come when all the sins that thou hast done
   shall be read before the universe and published in the light of day.
   What sayest thou to this, sinner? The sins of thy youth, thy secret
   sins--oh! man, let that thought pierce through thee like a point of
   steel, and cut thee to the very quick--thy sins shall live again. And
   thy conscience shall live. It is not often alive now. It is quiet,
   almost as quiet as the dead in the grave. But it shall soon awaken, the
   trumpet of the archangel shall break its long sleep; depend on that;
   the terrors of hell shall make thee lift up thine eyes which have so
   long been heavy with slumber. You have had an awakened conscience, but
   then you are still in the land of hope, you will find however that an
   awakened conscience when there is no Christ to flee to is an awful
   thing. Remorse of conscience has brought many a man to the knife and to
   the halter. Ah, careless sinner, you dare not to-night sit up an hour
   alone and think over the past and the future; you know you dare not.
   But there will be no avoiding conscience hereafter, it speaks now, but
   it will thunder then; it whispers now, and you may shut your ears, but
   its thunder-claps then shall so startle you that you cannot refuse to
   listen. Oh! transgressor, thy conscience shall live again, and shall be
   thy perpetual tormentor. Remember that your victims shall live again.
   Am I addressing any who have enticed companions into sin, and conducted
   friends to destruction? Your dupes shall meet you in another world and
   charge their ruin upon you. That young lad whom you led astray from the
   path of virtue shall point to you in hell and say, "He was my tempter."
   That woman--let us cover up that deed,--bright eyes shall sparkle upon
   you through the black darkness like the eyes of serpents, and you shall
   hear the hissing voice, "Thou didst bring me here," and you shall feel
   another hell in the hell of that other soul. Oh! God, save us, let the
   sins of our youth be covered. Oh, save us! Let the blood of Jesus be
   sprinkled on our conscience, for, there are none of us that dare meet
   our conscience alone! Shelter us, thou Rock of Ages. Deliver us from
   blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation. Sinner, remember thy
   God shall live. Thou thinkest him nothing now; thou shalt see him then.
   Thy business now stops the way; the smoke of time dims thy vision; the
   rough blasts of death shall blow all this away, and thou shalt see
   clearly revealed to thyself the frowning visage of an angry God. A God
   in arms, sinner, a God in arms, and no scabbard for his sword; a God in
   arms, and no shelter for thy soul; a God in arms, and even rocks
   refusing to cover thee; a God in arms, and the hollow depths of earth
   denying thee a refuge! Fly, soul! while it is yet time: fly, the cleft
   in the rock is open now. "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
   shalt be saved." "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; he
   that believeth not shall be damned." Fly, sinner, to the open arms of
   Jesus! Fly! for he casteth out none that come to him.

   And then, lastly, as this is true of the sinner, so it is true of the
   saint. He shall live again. If in this life only we had hope, we were
   of all men the most miserable. If we knew that we must die and not live
   for ever, our brightest joys would be quenched; and in proportion to
   the joy we lost would be the sorrow which followed. We shall live
   again. Godly wife, thy Christian husband, though he perished by the
   fatal "damp," shall live again, and thou shalt sit with him before the
   eternal throne. He finished his life with prayer amid his comrades, he
   shall begin anew with praise amid the cherubim. Widow, bereaven of thy
   many children, thou hast lost them all; not lost we hope, but gone
   before. Oh! there shall be joy when every link that was snapped shall
   be re-fitted; when again the circle shall be completed, and all losses
   restored.

   "Far, far removed from fear and pain,

   Dear brethren we shall meet again."

   That sweet hymn of the children is a blessed one after all--

   "We shall meet to part no more."

   Death, thou canst not rob us, thou canst not tear away a limb from
   Jesu's body! Thou canst not take away a single stone from the spiritual
   temple. Thou dost but transplant the flower, O death! thou dost not
   kill it. Thou dost but uproot it from the land of frost to flourish in
   the summer's clime; thou dost but take it from the place where it can
   only bud, to the place where it shall be full blown. Blessed be God for
   death, sweet friend of regenerated man! Blessed be God for the grave,
   safe wardrobe for these poor dusty garments till we put them on afresh
   glowing with angelic glory. Thrice blessed be God for resurrection, for
   immortality, and for the joy that shall be revealed in us. Brethren, my
   soul anticipates that day; let yours do the same. One gentle sigh and
   we fall asleep; perhaps we die as easily as those did in the colliery;
   we sleep into heaven, and wake up in Christ's likeness. When we have
   slept our last on earth, and open our eyes in heaven, oh! what a
   surprise! No aching arm, no darkness of the mine, no chokedarnp, no
   labor and no sweat, no sin, no stain there! Brethren, is not that verse
   near the fact which says,

   "We'll sing with rapture and surprise,

   His loving kindness in the skies?

   Shall we not be surprised to find ourselves in heaven? What a new place
   for the poor sinner. From the coal mine to celestial spheres. From
   black and dusty toil to bright and heavenly bliss. Above ground once
   for all, ay and above the skies too. Oh! long-expected day begin! When
   shall it come? Hasten it, Lord.

   Come death and some celestial hand,

   To bear our souls away!"

   I have thus tried to bring forward the text. Oh that the Lord, in whose
   name I desire to speak, may bless it to some among you. I have now to
   ask you kindly to think of those who are suffering through this
   terrible calamity. More than four hundred widows and orphans are left
   bereaved and penniless, for the working-man has little spare cash to
   provide for such contingencies. As a congregation we can do but little
   to alleviate so great a sorrow, let us, however, bear our part with
   others. I have no doubt the wealthier ones among you have already
   contributed in your different connexions, either through the Lord
   Mayor, or Mark Lane, or the Coal Market, or the Stock Exchange, or in
   some other way, but there are many of you who have not done so, and
   those who have may like an opportunity of doing so again. Let us do
   what we can to-night, that we may show our gratitude to God for having
   spared our lives; and as we drop our money into the box, let us offer a
   prayer that this solemn affliction may be blessed to all in the land,
   and that so Christ may be glorified.

   The preacher desires to bear testimony to the hearty sympathy which led
   his audience, on a cold wet evening to assemble in considerable
   numbers, and which opened up their hearts to subscribe £120 for the
   bereaved. May the Lord bind up the bleeding hearts!

   * This sermon was preached to commemorate the Hartley Mining Disaster
   of 16 January 1862--exactly two weeks prior to the preaching of this
   message. In one of the most horrific mining disasters ever, 204 men and
   boys lost their lives when part of a giant cast iron beam (more than 20
   tons of it) broke off the massive pumping engine and launched itself
   down the shaft, blocking the only exit and trapping more than 200 men
   in the vast underground coal pit. Although the remaining men of the
   town and hundreds from nearby communities laboured for days to try to
   open up a means of rescue, most of the men trapped in the pit probably
   succumbed to noxious gasses within 36 hours. At the time Spurgeon
   preached this message, bodies of the victims were still being
   recovered, and England was just coming to grips with the magnitude of
   the disaster. Pictures of a memorial erected near the disaster site may
   be viewed on the Web.

                                Life In Earnest

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 2, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He did it with all his heart and prospered." 2 Chronicles 31:21.
   This is no unusual occurrence. In fact, it seems to be the general rule
   of the moral universe that those men prosper who do their work with all
   their hearts, while those are almost certain to fail who go to their
   labor leaving half their hearts behind them. Look around you in
   business. Who are the young men who rise in the establishment? Not your
   men who sleep behind the counter, who are glad to avoid a customer.
   Employers soon discover those who throw energy into their work and they
   like a young man who has "push" in him.
   He is sure to be promoted and in time will become a trader on his own
   account. Who are the merchants that succeed in this busy time of
   competition? Your lazy sluggards? No. Your men who are diligent in
   business, do what they do with both their hands, breast the current
   with all their strength, scorning to be carried down the stream to the
   cataract of bankruptcy. Who are your men who rise to eminence? Men do
   not go to bed and wake up in the morning to find themselves famous, at
   least not until they have encountered many stern labors.
   God does not at this day give harvests to idle men except harvests of
   thistles, nor is He pleased to send wealth to the man who will not dig
   in the field to find its hidden treasure. It is universally confessed
   that if a man would prosper, he must be diligent in business. For at
   this day, beyond every preceding age it is true, "In the sweat of your
   brow shall you eat bread."

   The same thing is true if we leave mercantile pursuits and survey any
   other of the walks of life. If a man would make discoveries in science,
   he does not hit upon them by accident. But, being in the way, science
   meets with him. If a man would become eminent as a physician, he must
   walk the hospitals. If he would attain position at the bar, he must
   give days and nights to the folios of law. There is no hope for a man
   in these times, in anything, unless he proceeds to it with all his
   heart.

   It is the same in religion as it is in other things. I would not have
   you treat religion as though it were a business. But I would have you
   put as much force and power and energy and heartiness and earnestness
   into religion as ever you do into business, and, I might add, that it
   deserves far more. How is it that false religions have spread? What
   made Mohammedanism once so mighty in the earth? It was because Mahomet
   himself, when he preached, was as sincerely deluded as any of his
   followers--when he was pelted in the streets he still persevered and
   when assassins dogged his footsteps he counted not his life dear unto
   him that he might proclaim what he thought to be a revelation from
   Heaven.

   As for his followers, they were not sleepy professors. They drew their
   scimitars from their scabbards and swore that they would not rest till
   they had brought men by edge of steel to the faith of their prophet. On
   they dashed, till their religion, like a mighty rising ocean, swept all
   before it, nor could its rising wave be driven back till it was met by
   an equal enthusiasm to withstand its progress.

   Look again on Roman Catholic missions. How was it that Romanists did
   what we have never done and what I fear we never shall do till we have
   changed our men? How was it that Francis Xavier carried his faith into
   India, preached in Burma, obtained great influence in China and even
   entered into the recesses of Japan, till everywhere you might see a
   Catholic convent or nunnery and a crucifix lifted up, with devotees
   bowing before it? Because Xavier's spirit was full of fire. He seemed
   to be a flash of lightning flaming from one end of Heaven to the other.

   Now mark, as it has been with false religions, so must it be with the
   true. Under God, the Holy Spirit, our only hope for the increase of the
   Church and for the conversion of the world lies in the development of
   energy within us, in the bringing out of earnestness in Christian
   souls. Oh, it was not scholarship that converted the heathen world at
   first, for on the slabs in the catacombs we have decisive evidence that
   the first Christians could scarcely spell their own names. It was not
   the pomp of learning, the pride of philosophy, or the power of
   eloquence which made the early confessors so mighty. It was their
   singular earnestness.

   The Church was all on fire. She was like a volcano. She might not be
   high and lofty as some of the surrounding hills, but they had summits
   clothed with frost, while she sent forth earnest Truths of God like
   streams of lava, which burned their way and covered all the lands.
   Christians in those days were Christians, indeed. They believed what
   they professed. They knew what they spoke. They testified what they had
   seen. And they spoke with an unconquerable, untamable energy, which
   smote even the iron power of Rome and dashed it into shivers.

   So must it be today, and indeed, so is it. Look around you--who are the
   most useful men in the Christian Church today? The men who do what they
   undertake for God with all their hearts. Where is the preacher whom God
   blesses to the conversion of hundreds in a year? Is he a sleepy,
   prosaic soul? Does he confine himself within narrow limits? Does he
   speak sleepy words to a slumbering congregation? We know it is not so,
   but where God is pleased to give the congregation, it is, whatever it
   may not be, a proof that there has been earnestness in the preacher.

   Who are the most successful Sunday school teachers? The most learned?
   Every superintendent will tell you it is not so. The most talented? The
   most wealthy? No. They that are the most zealous. The men whose hearts
   are on fire--those are the men who honor Christ. Who among you today is
   doing the most for your Master's kingdom? I will tell you. Lend me a
   spiritual thermometer by which I may try the heat of your heart and I
   will tell you the amount of your success. If your hearts are cold
   towards God I am sure you are doing nothing though you may pretend to
   do it. But if you can say, "Lord, our soul is all on flame with an
   agony of desire to do good to the souls of men," then you are doing
   good, and God is blessing you as He did Hezekiah, who did it with all
   his heart and prospered.

   I feel that very many Christians are not Christians with all their
   hearts. I feel that perhaps some of you have only given Jesus Christ a
   dull, cobwebby corner of your hearts, instead of bidding Him sit at the
   head of the table and reign upon the throne. And fearing that we are
   all in danger of getting into a Laodicean lukewarm state, I wish to
   stir you up this morning. But if I may only stir myself up, I shall be
   thrice happy to go home and think that at least one has gotten some
   good from the service, for the preacher needs to be kept alive quite as
   much as the hearers. There is a danger that even the Lord's servant may
   lack the live coal upon his lips, and then he will be useless to his
   hearers.

   This morning we shall notice the effects of whole-heartedness upon the
   Christian. I shall then endeavor to stir you up with many arguments to
   be earnest in your work offaith and labor of love. And when I have so
   done, I shall address those to whom religion has as yet been a trifling
   matter. And God grant that they may be ready to seek the Lord with all
   their hearts, for then He will surely be found of them.

   I. First, then, let us notice THE SPHERE WHICH CHRISTIAN EARNESTNESS
   OCCUPIES IN THE DIVINE

   LIFE. Mark, I speak now only to those who are really and savingly
   converted to God, for if we are not first right with God, zeal for God
   is but a pretense.

   One of the first things that thorough earnestness will do for a
   Christian man is to make him think very earnestly for his Lord and
   Master. In the diary of Jonathan Edwards we find the following account
   of his feelings towards the Lord's work, "I had great longing for the
   advancement of Christ's kingdom in the world; my secret prayer used to
   be in great part taken up in praying for it. If I heard the least hint
   of anything that had happened in any part of the world which appeared
   to me, in some respect or other, to have favorable aspect on the
   interest of Christ's kingdom, my soul eagerly caught at it and it would
   much animate and refresh me. I used to be earnest to read public news
   letters, mainly for that end, to see if I could not find some news
   favorable to the interest of religion in the world."

   Now, when we are full of zeal for God, it is the same with us. Our
   thoughts are continually set upon Divine things. Go where we may, we
   regard our place not as a sphere for business, but as a sphere for
   usefulness. We make that our very first thought. Why, Beloved, if we
   are really in earnest for God, we shall begin to think of Christ's work
   in the world as soon as ever we wake. And when we rest at night it will
   be still with the Lord before us, and with His glory written in our
   hearts.

   I am afraid some of you think but very little of Him and of His cause
   in the world. How often when our missionary heralds are issued, nobody
   cares to read them. The annual report of what God is doing in foreign
   nations is generally the driest and dullest affair that ever comes in
   our way--not so much dry in itself but because we of this generation
   have not been tutored and schooled to think of the advance of the
   Gospel and the progress of Christ's cause. Let once this flaming torch
   of zeal kindle your souls and you will have Christ's cause upon your
   hearts at all times.

   But when a man has thus had his soul quickened, to consider the cause
   of Christ, the next thing he will do is to plan and to purpose for it.
   What fine purposes some men have at eccentric seasons! After they have
   listened to some earnest address they go home thinking--"Well, I must
   do something." And they half resolve they will, but, lacking the
   whole-heartedness of Hezekiah, the purpose never comes to a definite
   shape. It still resides in the clouds. As some men build castles in the
   air, so others build Churches there. They educate preachers in the air,
   they support Christ's ministers in the sky, they send out fresh
   missionaries in the clouds.

   All their plans are very beautiful, and all practical schemes are poor
   affairs compared with their magnificent projects, but then it is all an
   unsubstantial dream--a pleasing picture, a dissolving view, and it soon
   melts into something which for them is more practical--the world and
   the affairs thereof. Give a man earnestness, and every time he makes a
   purpose it is a purpose. Every stroke of the great motive-power within
   his soul reveals and sets a wheel in motion. He cannot let the blood
   circulate through him without its carrying life in every drop. But some
   men have dead blood in their veins, it is going round, going to the
   heart, and issuing from it, but there is no life in a drop of it.

   They can talk and they can sometimes make a resolve but it never comes
   to a definite purpose. They never set their ties and plant their feet
   down and say, "God helping me, I will do something. God being with me,
   I will not live in this world for nothing. I will not be as an oyster
   which lies in the mud and opens its shell according as the tide brings
   round the meal-time. It shall not be said that I live merely to eat and
   drink, and to accumulate wealth. But, O Christ Jesus! By everything
   that is true, if You will help me I will serve You while I live and, if
   it must be, will be prepared to die for Your cause." Only earnest men
   get so far as to select their purpose and adhere to it.

   Dear Friends, choose your gun, but mind you, stand to it till every
   round of ammunition is exhausted. We have known persons in a great
   spasm--in a sort of apoplectic fit of pious enthusiasm, make a huge
   resolve but they came to their cooler senses long before it is carried
   out. The blood has run to the land very powerfully, there has even been
   too much blood--they have rolled over in the spasm of fanaticism. It
   has never come to a practical effect.

   Now, when a man's heart is right with God, what he has resolved to do
   he will do. I can speak for one, when I say I know a man who, when he
   feels that God has given him a work to do--when he has once resolved it
   shall be done-- would move Heaven and earth but what he would
   accomplish it. And he would sooner break his heart or destroy his
   health than he would fail in it. For he feels that if it is God's work,
   it must be done. Man's work may stop, but God's work cannot. And when
   any get in his way, or seem to thwart his purpose, that man feels his
   zeal so boiling over, that for God's sake he forgets everything else.
   And even dear friendships snap when it appears as if Christ's cause
   were imperiled.

   I know this, that when a man gets thoroughly alive for God, he cannot
   put up with those lazy sluggards who will neither work themselves nor
   permit others to labor. When once a Believer gets his spirit wholly up
   to the work, it is now--for God and Christ--follow who may. But as for
   you that are faint-hearted, go to your homes lest you make the man of
   God's heart to faint. Stand away, lest the chilling influence of your
   icy souls should do something to abate our fervor. Methinks a Christian
   is never worth much till, having been brought up to the point of
   resolve, he will achieve the Heaven-born purpose, come what may. Until
   he is ready to crash and smash everything earthly and worldly so that
   he may accomplish his life-work in the name of the eternal God who
   called him to it.

   His earnestness of purpose will show itself in perseverance. The man
   fell the first time--"Never mind," says he, "It is God's work. We will
   try again." He breaks down again--but he falls to rise. There he sees
   the summit of the mountain glittering in the sunlight. And though he
   has a burden on his back, he vows, "I will climb there." He has fallen
   down that crag and he lies there black with bruises, groaning and
   moaning. The first thing he does when he wipes his eyes of the dust, is
   to look up and say, "I will mount there yet." He climbs again--but an
   antagonist shoves him down. He has not time to stop and examine who it
   is, and resent the insult--he recommences the ascent.

   Now and then he runs. When he cannot run he walks. And when he cannot
   walk he creeps. And when it seems impossible to go on hands and knees,
   he is content to pull himself up by his hands alone, oftentimes even
   grasping a briar and sending a thorn into his flesh, but still saying,
   "It is God's place and He has bid me climb and in His Divine strength I
   will do it. I cannot rest, I cannot be quiet till the deed is done."
   Perseverance is the sure effect of this whole-heartedness for God. Mark
   carefully that this heart being thus on fire will show its zeal in an
   entire dependence upon God and in intensely fervent prayer for God's
   help and for God's blessing.

   Surely a man cannot know himself, who, when he has a high and noble
   purpose, attempts it apart from God. He is well persuaded that if it is
   God's work it must be done in God's strength and as he must have that
   strength, he goes before God as if he meant to have it, and could take
   no denial. One of the old Puritans says, "When we pray to God without
   fervency we do, as it were, ask Him to deny us. But when we can go with
   fervency, then we must prevail." Oh, those prayers which one has
   sometimes heard when the man of God seemed like a Samson! He gets hold
   of the two pillars of Heaven and bowing himself with all his strength
   to pull down the mercy and to destroy his sins, he knocks at Heaven's
   gate as for dear life--the knock of a starving beggar who cannot afford
   to be unheard.

   Oh, that is prevailing prayer, when we can get a grip of the angel and
   wrestle with him. I saw in one of the Churches in Paris a picture by an
   eminent artist representing Jacob wrestling with the angel. I had not
   exactly conceived it so literally as the artist had, for he has
   sketched the Patriarch with his foot between the angel's feet, trying
   to throw him down and wrestling just as wrestlers might do in the ring.
   There ought to be a practical purpose about our prayer and as intense
   an earnestness to win the blessing from the angel as there is on the
   part of the wrestler to hurl his foe upon his back. We shall never get
   true and lasting revival in the Church till we have men who in the
   supplications do their work with all their hearts and thus prosper.

   My dear Friends, I shall not enlarge further to show you the proper
   sphere of earnestness--the fact is that it enters into every part of
   the spiritual man. Earnestness quickens his pulse, increases the
   circulation of his blood, it makes the man in all respects in an
   healthy state. These holy stimulants make the soul stronger than the
   giant when he is refreshed with new wine. If you would ask me what fire
   has to do with the Christian sacrifice, I would answer it has
   everything to do with it. You may present a sacrifice in the dark but
   you cannot consume a sacrifice without flame. You may do with very
   little light, but you must have fire to burn the whole victim, or else
   the sacrifice is no offering at all.

   Oh for more of this fire! Jesus! Master! Baptize us with the Holy
   Spirit and with fire! Fill our souls with fervor! Restore unto us the
   indomitable energy of our ancestors. Give us back the northern iron and
   steel, to which their resolute natures may be likened--deliver us from
   these willow days in which men bend before every blast--make us strong
   men to run the race of righteousness, and mighty men made mighty
   through Your Spirit, with earnestness to serve You among the sons of
   men!

   II. I shall want your earnest attention while I labor TO STIR YOU UP BY
   CERTAIN ARGUMENTS WHICH MAY PROVOKE YOU TO THIS EARNESTNESS.

   Either our religion is the grossest impostor that was ever palmed upon
   mankind, or else it is one which deserves the whole life and force and
   strength of every man who has been blessed by it. I would today, if I
   were not sure that God's Word is true and that the precious Doctrines
   of Grace are the very revelation of Heaven, renounce them boldly. Oh, I
   could not, I hope--I speak before God--hold the religion of Christ and
   yet be sleepy about it. It does seem to me that if religion is worth
   anything, it is worth everything--and that for man to keep his
   godliness as some great farmers do their little off-hand farms, which
   they merely farm for pleasure, while their very life and substance is
   spent in another place, seems to me to be the height of wickedness and
   the topmost ridge of absurdity.

   Either I would never seek God and His righteousness at all, or I would
   seek them first. It seems to me to be an insane attack upon everything
   like wisdom, to put the worst things first and the best things last--to
   put the world on our heads and Heaven under our feet--to make Christ
   second best and to make Mammon chief and lord in our affections. Surely
   this will never do.

   But, Christian Brothers and Sisters, that I may have your hearts warmed
   this morning, may the Spirit of God take these things and lay them like
   hot coals to your souls. Remember, my Brothers and Sisters, what solemn
   things you and I have to deal with. We have to deal with the souls of
   men, immortal, infinitely precious. We have to clear under God with the
   eternal interests of Heaven and Hell. We have dealings with the
   sinner's sin and long to see it washed away with the precious blood of
   Christ. We have dealings with man's natural death in sin and long that
   men may be regenerated by the Holy Spirit.

   Now, if the soul is what Scripture tells us it is--if there is a Heaven
   and a Hell--if Christ has made an atonement for sin, these are things
   that cannot be trifled with. As well dance upon the altar of God, or
   dabble a harlot's garments in the blood of the Paschal Lamb, as trifle
   and be half-hearted when we have to deal with such awful things as
   these.

   Consider the greatness of the work we have to deal with. Have any of
   you a glimpse of an idea of this one city of London? Three million!
   Three million! As many as the Scottish nation, with some sixty thousand
   added to the number every year--more added than we add accommodation in
   places of worship to receive them, so that if our Churches grow--still
   not in the same ratio as the population. It is said that we have more
   than half a million inhabitants in this city who are heathens--as
   positively heathens as though they lived under the sway of the king of
   Dahomey, or dwelt in the very center of Tartary--without God and
   without Christ! They never listen to the Gospel, never enter a place of
   worship from the beginning of the year to the end of it. This is the
   work for which we must gird up our loins.

   Oh, dear Brethren! We cannot afford to be half-hearted here. If there
   is some happy city somewhere in the world where all men hear the Word
   and where the most are converted, even there coldness is inexcusable.
   But here, here in this awful city with so much to do, asleep!! Oh, God,
   forgive us that we are not more awake! Think how few there are to do
   the work. There are, perhaps, many so called laborers, men who wear the
   robes of priesthood but who know not Christ in the power of His Gospel.
   How few there are of the faithful among men who are ready to spend and
   be spent!

   When I look at the great harvest--enlarge your thoughts for a moment,
   the field is the world--when I see corn field after corn field, a
   thousand million immortal souls. And in some countries one missionary
   to two million, and in others, not one even to ten million immortal
   souls--one may wipe the sweat from his brow in the hot and sultry day
   but only the cold-hearted will stop to rest, for there is so much to
   do. "The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few." And
   shall those laborers sleep? O Lord, we beseech You, have pity upon us
   and help us never to sleep again but to be in earnest for poor souls.

   Think, I pray you, how earnest Satan is. If we slumber, he never does.
   If we are idle, certainly he never is. As Hugh Latimer said, the devil
   is the most busy prelate in the land. He traverses his diocese. He is
   always visiting his flock. He is instant in season and out of season to
   destroy. See the activity of the infidel and the Romanist--those who
   hold false doctrines--how zealously do they compass sea and land to
   make one proselyte. What are we doing? I say, Brethren, what are we
   doing? Call it nothing and you have not called it by too small a name.
   They are alive and we are half dead. They are boiling in fervent heat
   and we are neither cold nor hot, but lukewarm.

   And, oh, I pray you, my Hearers, think and let this move you--think of
   the responsibilities which lie upon us as a Church. I speak not
   egotistically, to glorify either myself personally or myself in you.
   But there has never been a congre-gation--certainly never a dissenting
   congregation--which has been more favored than we have been. What has
   God worked! What a dew from Heaven has rested upon the Word! What
   multitudes have been added to the Church! What manner of people are we
   to be? Indeed, Brethren, I do not need to censure, for your obligations
   are felt and the Holy Spirit is helping you to fulfill them.

   There are men in the midst of this Church of whom I dare speak in any
   and in every company, and say that Apostolic days scarcely produced men
   superior to them. I have the felicity and the honor to see some in this
   Church who are patterns of everything that is good. They not only spend
   their time for Christ, but who beyond what I ever expected to see of
   mortal men. They give labor, substance and talent to Christ and His
   cause. Those I always look upon with joy as being the honorable product
   of the Truth of God fully, fairly and faithfully preached.

   But there are many others of whom this could not be said. Oh, we were
   speaking lies in hypocrisy if we said of all of you that you were doing
   what you could do, or half what you can do! Yes, and in some cases a
   hundredth part of what you will wish you had done when you come to lie
   upon your beds. God has been pleased to give a congregation and to give
   to that congregation a ministry upon which the Spirit has rested, as is
   manifested in the many--the very many conversions which daily take
   place in our midst.

   The Christian world has looked upon us and said, "How God has favored
   that Church!" And if we sleep, what base ungrateful wretches shall we
   be? If God has brought us to the kingdom for such a time as this, and
   we prove unworthy, deliverance will come from some other quarter to
   this land but we shall have to write Ichabod upon these walls, for the
   glory will depart. God will leave us to our own devices. We have had
   opportunities of doing good that have been seldom offered to any body
   of Christians, and if we do not avail ourselves of them, the most
   withering curse that ever came upon a Christian community must most
   certainly fall upon us. Oh, may God help us to be found faithful to our
   charge.

   Do you need anything else to stir you up? Behold, before you today the
   stream of death washing away myriads of souls--behold, I say, before
   you this morning, the dying souls of men. Listen! Their moans are going
   up to Heaven now, the groans which they utter in their last agonies are
   accusing you before the Most High. "None cared for my soul," is the cry
   of many. "Great God, I lived in a Christian land but none cared for my
   soul! I lived in a court or in an alley and Christian people passed the
   entrance of that alley to go to Chapel but they never thought about me.
   I lived next door to a Christian man but he never prayed for me. I
   lived in a top room of the very house where there lived a man of God
   but he never thought of me!"

   Oh, hear those last cries, I say, as the Spirit for the last time
   reflects upon the cold Church which cared not for her children. Hear
   the accusation of the angel as he cries, "The sea monsters draw out the
   breast, they give suck to their young ones--the daughter of my people
   is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. The tongue of
   the sucking child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst--the
   young children ask for bread and no man breaks it unto them."

   Hear, I beseech you and let it startle you into earnestness--hear the
   shrieks of the damned spirits for a moment. Another soul has gone to
   Hell, and while we speak, another and another and another. Listen to
   the solemn fall, the moving of the black waters as they close around
   the sinking spirit. As roll the masses of water down Niagara's steep,
   so roll the waves of souls into perdition. And you, you are the men
   whom God has sent to be the saviors of the world--will you waste the
   moments and neglect your charge?

   Black night has settled upon the nations and you, you only, are the men
   who carry the flaming torch into the thick darkness--followers of
   Christ, disciples of Jesus. You are to be the deliverers of those who
   sit in the valley of the shadow of death bound in affliction and iron.
   Will you sit still, will you fold your arms, will you give to the world
   and self that which belongs to Christ? Let my tears influence you. But
   what are these if shrieks of doomed souls cannot awaken us? What hearts
   of adamant we must have, not to feel while the terrors of Hell are
   around us! What granite heart must we have received if we believe that
   men are being lost and yet never care for them!

   Oh, sits there a Christian man anywhere around me, above, or beneath,
   who cares not for man's soul? I pray God to send into his ears one
   piercing shriek from Tophet and let that abide in his memory and ring
   in his soul until he says, "I must do something to win sinners to
   Christ."

   But once more--and if I fail here--I break down altogether. I conjure
   myself and you to serve God with all our hearts, because of that love
   which we have received of Jesus. Look, there He hangs--my eyes behold
   Him. His head is crowned with thorns. His feet are pierced with nails.
   His hands are dripping with blood. Jesus, Master! You are dying for me!
   That precious heart's blood of Yours is flowing for my redemption and
   for my cleansing. At Your feet I fall and kiss You. O Lover of my soul,
   I cannot but love You, You have won my heart. The love of Christ
   constrains me! And do You, Lord, for sinners, bleed? For rebels, for
   enemies, for those who would not have You to reign over them and shall
   I not adore You?

   Yes, but when I rise from my knees, shall I go forth into the world and
   forget You? Thorn-crowned head, shall I forget You? Pierced hands and
   feet, shall I forget You? Mangled body, shall I forget You? Slaughtered
   Emmanuel, shall I forget You? God forbid!--

   "Sooner than not my Savior lo ve Oh, may I cease to be."

   Beloved, what do you say? Will you look into His face and never weep
   for souls? Will you look upon His wounds and your heart never be
   wounded for poor dying men? Will you live unto yourselves and die unto
   yourselves?

   Sirs, the infidel is not far wrong when he tells us that our religion
   is hypocrisy, if we can be half-hearted over it. Go, go you enemy of
   the Church, tell it in Gath. Publish it in the streets of Ascalon, till
   we become a hissing and a reproach if you shall find us living, as
   though the Truth of God were a lie and as though the doctrines revealed
   of God were but a delusion and an impostor! Wake up, Church of God! Why
   are you given to slumber? O for a voice like thunder! How would I make
   you wake! But what am I, more than half asleep myself? I read the life
   of such men as Alleine of Taunton, and Baxter of Kidderminster,
   Grimshaw of Haworth and Whitfield of everywhere--I blush at my cold
   heart.

   Especially when perusing the life of our Apostle Paul, I blush a
   thousand times to think how idly I have lived. Sinners, these were
   men--the tears streamed down their cheeks when they thought of sinners
   lost forever. Their words froze not like icicles upon their lips--they
   spoke and every word was power. Oh how they pleaded! How Paul could
   say, "Night and day with tears," (hear how he puts it), "as though God
   did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's place, be you reconciled
   to God." He surely could not accuse himself that he had not poured out
   his soul for men. No, these men lived.

   We dare not say we live. Oh, the long-suffering and the tender mercy of
   God, that He has had compassion on such a Church as that of the present
   day and that He continues to have mercy upon us, when we are so dull
   and sluggish in the service of Christ. Even while I am preaching thus I
   feel sorry that we should have need of such a sermon. When the Spartans
   went to battle, every Spartan marched with songs, willing to fight. But
   when the Persians went to the conflict, you could hear as the regiments
   came on the crack of whips, as the officers drove their soldiers to the
   fight. You need not wonder that a few Spartans were more than a match
   for thousands of Persians--that in fact, they were like lions in the
   midst of sheep.

   So let it be with the Church, never needing to be flogged to action but
   full of an irrepressible life which longs for conflict against
   everything which is contrary to God. Then we should be like lions in
   the midst of herds of our enemies and nothing, through God, should be
   able to stand against us. Play no longer, men! Cease your piping and
   dancing in the market places. Come, lift up your hands from those
   childish toys! Come away men, come away from the dormitories where you
   sleep so luxuriously and from the playgrounds where you sport so
   merrily!

   Get to something that is worth doing, to something that is high and
   noble and heavenly, befitting your birth. "What is this you are calling
   play?" you say. Why your work, your business, your cares, unless they
   are sanctified to God. I tell you, Sirs, that in the light of eternity
   all thing else save serving God are mere child's-play, mere
   theatricals, mere masquerading. They are but the mummeries of a
   carnival, the jests of a comedy, the laughter of a pantomime. It is
   only serving God that is doing immortal work. It is only living for
   Christ that is living at all.

   III. And now I must draw to a conclusion--may God give me fresh Grace
   while I undertake the solemn work OF

   DEALING WITH CARELESS AND UNCONVERTED SOULS.

   When Mr. Whitfield was preaching in the parish Church of Haworth, he
   said when he came to the point of self-examination, "I was about to
   address the ungodly but I suppose that after the faithful ministry to
   which you have listened in this Church, there is very little need for
   me to say anything about this." Mr. Grimshaw thereupon rose and said,
   "Brother Whitfield, don't flatter them, I fear that half of them are
   going to Hell with their eyes open."

   And I must say this morning, blessing God for all the conversions that
   have taken place here, yet for God's sake we dare not flatter you.
   There are many of you still in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds
   of iniquity, as far from God as ever you were. Though we have wept over
   you and preached to you again and again, yet your hard hearts will not
   break. Up to now you have been proof that we can do nothing, and unless
   the Spirit of God shall come upon you, we fear that you will remain the
   same. But now in God's name let us talk to you.

   And so, my Hearers, you think that the things of God are not worth
   serious thought, at least not yet. If they are not altogether trifling
   things, they are of such secondary importance that any time will do.
   The scraggy end of your life will suffice, you think, for them. Now let
   me remind you who may be sporting with these things, that this is
   inconsistent with reason and sense. You will find dying to be very
   earnest work. It will be no amusement to be smitten by the hand of
   death, to go to your deathbed with your physician's voice in your ear,
   "Nothing can be done for you, you may linger for a little while but you
   must die."

   When the death struggle comes on, when death gets you, when the grim
   monster shakes you till you feel every bone rattle, when they wipe the
   death sweat of the last conflict from your brow, when the darkness
   steals over your eyes, when your extremities chill with death, when the
   voice is choked, when the death rattle is in your throat, oh, Sirs, you
   will not laugh, then! You will not say these things are fancies! You
   will have no hard words in those last moments against those who warned
   you.

   Men laughed at Noah when he built his ark upon dry land, but when they
   were climbing to the mountain tops to escape the inundating waves, they
   had no material for jest and satire. Then their tears and cries and
   groans proved that they felt the truth of Noah's preaching of
   righteousness. It will be so with you--mark, whosoever shall be the
   witness of it--you will find death no child's play. And then comes the
   judgment. The heavens are on fire, the earth is shaking. The Judge is
   sitting and the books are opened. Will you laugh then, when you hear
   your name proclaimed with the addition "Come to judgment, come away?"

   When the eye of the Judge shall be fixed upon you and He shall turn to
   that page which records your deeds, and shall solemnly read them while
   men and angels hear--Sinner! Sinner! It is enough to drive the laughter
   out of you this morning if you would but hear even the distant echo of
   the awful voice which shall pronounce the sentence, "Depart you cursed
   into everlasting fire in Hell, prepared for the devil and his angels."

   After the judgment, what comes then, Sinner? Then comes wrath without
   end. God will deal with you. His bare arm shall smite you. Beware, lest
   He tear you to pieces and there be none to deliver you. In eternity,
   mercy's gates are shut-- God's long-suffering is then over. Justice
   commences its awful work. Soul, you will have no merry jests in Hell.
   You will find no laughter there at God's mysteries. Oh, you may go on
   trifling now, my Hearers, but then you will not. You may say a little
   more sleep and a little more slumber today--but there will be none of
   it then.

   Oh, how you will look back upon the misspent past and wish, but wish in
   vain, that you had never been created, sooner than that you should have
   lived to lose your only hope of salvation, your only time in which you
   might find salvation. O God, my God, I beseech You plead with men, for
   we are weak! Plead with them, and make them feel that death, nor
   judgment, nor Hell are things to be trifled with!

   Will you remember, you who are the butterflies of the day, the insects
   who flit from flower to flower? Remember that Christ did not trifle
   when He came into the world to save souls. His was no life spent in the
   polished refinements of gaiety. His was a stern, awful life--His was a
   zeal that ate Him up. When He sweat great drops of blood, it was no
   light burden He had to carry upon those blessed shoulders. And when He
   poured out His heart, it was no weak effort He was making for the
   salvation of His people.

   Ah, Sinner! Ah, Sinner! Was Christ in earnest and are you foolish? Was
   Christ in earnest, I say, and do you despise, do you forget, do you
   neglect this great salvation? I may add, the ministers whom God sends
   are in earnest. I can say at this moment, I do feel a longing for the
   conversion of my hearers, such as I cannot describe. I would count it a
   high privilege if I might sleep in death this morning, if that death
   could redeem your souls from Hell. But why is it that we can feel? Oh,
   that we felt more! Why is it that we can weep when you do not? What is
   your soul to us, compared with what it must be to you? If we warn you,
   and you perish, your blood will not be required at our hand. It is only
   if we are cold and indifferent that we shall be held responsible.

   But when we have poured out our heart unto you, when we have stretched
   out our arms and like a loving mother with a child, have sought to
   bring you to the arms of Jesus, we have done all that we can do. We
   must leave the rest with God. But how is it, why is it, that you can
   trifle? It is your own salvation, not mine. It is your own eternal
   state. It is you that will lie forever in the pit, or joyously climb to
   Heaven. It is you, Sinner, yourself! Not your neighbor, not the person
   that is sitting next to you, but you, standing there in the crowd, or
   you yonder--each of you personally. Oh, why should we be earnest and
   you be dull? God forgive you this sin and forbid you to trifle longer.

   But lastly, you will find God to be in earnest when He comes to punish
   you. When He lets loose His terrors on you, you shall find it no sport.
   When the arrow which is today fitted to the string shall fly, you shall
   find it to be no babe's toy. When the sword which has been long in
   furbishing and which is bathed in Heaven, shall begin to cut, you may
   say to it, "Oh, Sword, when will you rest, when will you be quiet." But
   it will know no rest, for it will be awfully and solemnly in earnest
   with you, punishing you for your sins.

   Would now that one could awake you! Would that every heart here felt
   the need of whole-heartedness towards God. But you will not mind
   it--you will go away and I shall be unto you as one that plays a tune
   upon a goodly instrument, and it will all be forgotten. There was a
   tear just now--perhaps rather a tear of sympathy excited by
   earnestness, than a tear from your own hearts, for your own case. You
   will go away and forget it all, and you will come again and forget it
   again. And we shall go on praying with you, and preaching to you, but
   you will forget it. And one day it will be said, "So-and-So is dead, he
   died without a hope." And though it will be some consolation, yet what
   a sad one for the minister to be able to say, "Well, as in the sight of
   God, I did all I could, I did warn, teach, exhort, and plead with him."

   Oh, how much better if God shall bless the Word to you, and we shall
   hear you tell that He took you up out of the horrible pit and out of
   the miry clay and set your feet upon a rock and established your
   goings. "Believe in the Lord Jesus

   Christ and you shall be saved." Faith in Christ is the great way of
   salvation. Trust Jesus, trust Him with all your heart and you are saved
   this morning and your sins are gone!

   And when you are saved yourself, I pray you forget not what I have
   tried to instill this morning--that if we serve God with all our hearts
   we shall prosper in His ways. And that we cannot expect to see His
   blessing upon anything that we do, unless we do it as unto the Lord and
   not unto men.

                            Threefold Sanctification

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 9, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Sanctified by God the Father." "Sanctified in Christ Jesus." Jude 1:1.
   1 Corinthians 1:2.
   "Through sanctification of the Spirit" 1 Peter 1:2.
   MARK, Beloved, the union of the Three Divine Persons in all their
   gracious acts. We believe that there is one God, and although we
   rejoice to recognize the Trinity, yet it is ever most distinctly a
   Trinity in Unity. Our watch-word still is--"Hear O Israel, the LORD our
   God is one LORD." How unwisely do those young Believers talk, who make
   preferences in the Persons of the Trinity--who think of Christ as if He
   were the embodiment of everything that is lovely and gracious, while
   the Father they regard as severely just but destitute of kindness.
   And how foolish are those who magnify the decree of the Father, or the
   atonement of the Son, so as to depreciate the work of the Spirit. In
   deeds of Divine Grace none of the Persons of the Trinity act apart from
   the rest. They are as united in their deeds as in their essence. In
   their love towards the chosen they are One, and in the actions which
   flow from that great central source they are still undivided.
   Especially I would have you notice this in the case of sanctification.
   While we may, without the slightest mistake, speak of sanctification as
   the work of the Spirit, yet we must take heed that we do not view it as
   if the Father and the Son had no part in it. It is correct to speak of
   sanctification as the work of the Father, of the Spirit, and of the
   Son. Still does Jehovah say, "Let Us make man in our Own image after
   Our likeness," and thus we are "Hs workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
   unto good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in
   them."

   My Brethren, I beg you to notice and carefully consider the value which
   God sets upon real holiness, since the Three Persons are represented as
   co-working to produce a Church without "spot, or wrinkle, or any such
   thing." Those men who despise holiness of heart are in direct conflict
   with God. Holiness is the architectural plan upon which God builds up
   His living temple. We read in Scripture of the "beauties of holiness."
   Nothing is beautiful before God but that which is holy. All the glory
   of Lucifer, that son of the morning, could not screen him from Divine
   abhorrence when he had defiled himself by sin.

   "Holy, Holy, Holy"--the continual cry of cherubim--is the loftiest song
   that a creature can offer, and the noblest that the Divine Being can
   accept. See then, He counts holiness to be His choice treasure. It is
   as the seal upon His heart and as the signet upon His right hand. He
   could as soon cease to be, as cease to be holy, and sooner renounce the
   sovereignty of the world than tolerate anything in His presence
   contrary to purity, righteousness and holiness. I pray you, you who
   profess to be followers of Christ, set a high value upon purity of life
   and godliness of conversation.

   Value the blood of Christ as the foundation of your hope, but never
   speak disparagingly of the work of the Spirit which is your meetness
   for the inheritance of the saints in light. Yes, rather, prize
   it--prize it so heartily that you dread the very appearance of evil.
   Prize it so that in your most ordinary actions you may be, "a royal
   priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, showing forth the praises
   of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light."

   My design was to have entered at large upon the doctrine of
   sanctification this morning. I intended to use the word
   "sanctification" in the mode in which it is understood among
   theologians. For you must know that the term "sanctification" has a far
   narrower meaning in bodies of divinity than it has in Scripture. But in
   studying the subject I found myself lost in its ever-widening extent,
   so that I concluded to attempt less in the hope of efficiently doing
   more.

   On some future occasion we will enter at length into the Spirit's work,
   but now I only call attention to the fact that sanctification is
   treated in Scripture in various ways. I think we may do some service in
   illuminating the understanding of Believers, if we shall this morning
   draw their attention not to the theological but to the Scriptural uses
   of the term "sanctification," and show that, in God's Holy Word, it has
   a much wider meaning than is accorded to it by systematic divines.

   It has been well said that the Book of God, like the works of God, is
   not systematically arranged. How different is the freedom of nature
   from the orderly precision of the scientific museum! If you visit the
   British Museum you see all the animals there placed in cases according
   to their respective orders. You go into God's world and find dog and
   sheep, horse and cow, lion and vulture, elephant and ostrich roaming
   abroad as if no zoologist had ever ventured to arrange them in classes.
   The various rocks are not laid in order as the geologist draws them in
   his books, nor are the stars marked off according to their magnitudes.

   The order of Nature is variety. Science does but arrange and classify,
   so as to assist the memory. So systematic divines, when they come to
   deal with God's Word, find Scriptural truths put, not in order for the
   classroom, but for common life. The systematic divine is as useful as
   the analytical chemist, or the anatomist, but still the Bible is not
   arranged as a body of divinity. It is a handbook to Heaven. It is a
   guide to eternity, meant for the man at the plow, as much as for the
   scholar at his table. It is a primer for babes, as well as a classic
   for sages.

   It is the humble, ignorant man's book, and though there are depths in
   it in which the elephant may swim, yet there are shallows where the
   lamb may wade. We bless God that He has not given us a body of divinity
   in which we might lose ourselves, but that He has given us His own
   Word, put into the very best practical form for our daily use and
   edification.

   It is a recognized truth among us, that the Old Testament very often
   helps us to understand the New, while the New also expounds the Old.
   With God's Word, self-interpretation is the best. "Diamond cut diamond"
   is a rule with a goldsmith--so must it be with a Scriptural student.
   They who would know best, God's Word, must study it in its own light.

   I. Now, in the Old Testament we find the word "sanctify" very
   frequently, indeed, and it is used there in three senses. Let me call
   your attention to the first one. The word "sanctify" in the Old
   Testament frequently has the meaning of setting apart It means the
   taking of something which was common before, which might legitimately
   have been put to ordinary uses, and setting it apart for God's service,
   alone. It was then called sanctified or holy. Take, for instance, the
   passage in the 13th chapter of Exodus at the 2nd verse. "Sanctify unto
   me all the first-born."

   On account of the destruction of the first-born of Egypt, God claimed
   the first-born of men and the first-born of cattle to be His. The tribe
   of Levi was set apart to be the representatives of the first-born, to
   stand before the Lord to minister day and night in His tabernacle and
   in His temple. Those who were thus set apart to be priests and Levites
   were said to be sanctified. There is an earlier use of the term in the
   2nd chapter of Genesis, at the 3rd verse. It is said, "And God blessed
   the seventh day and sanctified it: because that in it He had rested
   from all His work which God created and made."

   It had been an ordinary portion of time before, but He set it apart for
   His own service, that on the seventh day man should do no work for
   himself, but rest and serve his Maker. So in Leviticus 27:14, you read,
   "And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord,"
   etc., which was meant as a direction to devout Jews who set apart a
   house or field to be God's. Intending that either the produce of the
   field or the occupation of the house should be wholly given either to
   God's priests or Levites, or in some other way set apart to holy uses.

   Now, nothing was done to the house. There were no ceremonies. We do not
   read that it was cleansed or washed or sprinkled with blood. But the
   mere fact that it was set apart for God was considered to be a
   sanctification. So in the most notable of instances in the Book of
   Exodus 29:44, we read that God said, "I will sanctify the tabernacle of
   the congregation and the altar," by which plainly enough was meant that
   He would set it apart to be His house, the special place of His abode,
   where between the wings of the cherubim the bright light of the
   Shekinah might shine forth, the glorious evidence that the Lord God
   dwelt in the midst of His people.

   To the same effect are such as the following: The sanctification of the
   altar, instruments and vessels, in Numbers 7:1, the setting apart of
   Eleazer the son of Abinadab, to keep the ark of the Lord while it was
   at Kirjathjearim, 1 Samuel 7:1, and the establishment of cities of
   refuge in Joshua 20:7, where in the original we find that the word
   rendered "appointed" is the same which elsewhere is translated
   "sanctified." It plainly appears from the Old Testament that the word
   "sanctify" sometimes has the meaning simply, and only, of setting apart
   for holy uses.

   This explains a text in John 10:36, "Say you of Him whom the Father has
   sanctified and sent into the world, 'you blaspheme,' because I said I
   am the Son of God?" Jesus Christ there speaks of Himself as
   "sanctified" by His Father. Now He was not purged from sin, for He had
   none. Immaculately conceived, gloriously preserved from all touch or
   stain of evil, He needed no sanctifying work of the Spirit within Him
   to purge Him from dross or corruption. All that is here intended is
   that He was set apart. So in that notable and well known passage in
   John 17:19, "And for their sakes I sancti- fy Myself that they also
   might be sanctified through the truth," by which, again, He meant only
   that He gave Himself up especially to God's service--to be occupied
   only with His Father's business.

   He could say, "It is My meat and My drink to do the will of Him that
   sent Me and to finish His work." Brethren, you understand, now, the
   text in Jude, "Sanctified by God the Father." Surely it means that God
   the Father has especially set apart His people or sanctified them. Not
   that God the Father works operatively in the Believer's heart, although
   Paul tells us it is God that works in us to will and to do--that
   belongs immediately and effectively to the Holy Spirit--but He in the
   decree of election separated unto Himself a people who were to be
   sanctified to Himself forever and ever.

   He, by the gift of His Son, redeemed for them, them from among men that
   they might be holy. And He by continually sending forth the Spirit
   fulfils His Divine purpose that they should be a separate people
   sanctified from all the rest of mankind. In this sense every Christian
   is perfectly sanctified already. We may speak of Believers as those who
   are sanctified by God the Father, that is to say, they are set apart.
   They were set apart before they were created, they were legally set
   apart by the purchase of Christ, they are manifestly and visibly set
   apart by the effectual calling of the Spirit of Divine Grace. They are,
   I say, in this sense, at all periods sanctified. And speaking of the
   work as it concerns God the Father, they are completely sanctified unto
   the Lord forever.

   Is not this doctrine clear enough to you all? Leave the doctrine a
   moment, and let us look at it practically. Brothers and Sisters, have
   we ever realized this Truth of God as we ought to do? When a vessel,
   cup, altar, or instrument was set apart for Divine worship, it was
   never used for common purposes again. No man but the priest might drink
   out of the golden cup. The altar might not be trifled with. God's
   brazen laver was not for ordinary washing. Even the tongs upon the
   altar and the snuffers for the lamps were never to be profaned for any
   common purpose whatever.

   What a suggestive and solemn fact is this! If you and I are sanctified
   by God the Father, we ought never to be used for any purpose but for
   God. "What," you say, "not for ourselves?" My Brethren, not for
   ourselves. You are not your own. You are bought with a price. "But must
   we not work and earn our own bread?" Verily, you must, but still not
   with that as your object. You must still be "diligent in business,
   fervent in spirit, serving the Lord." Remember, if you are servants,
   you are to serve not with eye service as men-pleasers but serving the
   Lord. If any man shall say "I have an occupation in which I cannot
   serve the Lord," leave it, you have no right in it.

   But I think there is no calling in which man can be found, certainly no
   lawful calling, in which he may not be able to say, "Whether I eat or
   drink, or whatever I do, I do all to the glory of God." The Christian
   is no more a common man than was the altar a common place. It is as
   great a sacrilege for the Believer to live unto himself, or to live
   unto the world, as you and I could have profaned the most holy place,
   used the holy fire for our own kitchen, or the censer for common
   perfume, or the candlestick for our own chamber.

   These things were God's--none might venture to appropriate them--and we
   are God's--and must be used only for Him. Oh, Christians, would that
   you could know this! You are Christ's men, God's men--servants of God
   through Jesus Christ. You are not to do your own works. You are not to
   live for your own objects. You are to say at all times, "God forbid
   that I should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus." You are
   practically to take this for your motto, "For me to live is Christ and
   to die is gain." I fear nine out of ten professing Christians have
   never recognized this fact. They think if they were to devote a partof
   their substance that would do, or a partof their time will suffice.

   Oh, Christ did not buy a partof you--Brothers and Sisters--Jesus Christ
   did not purchase a part of you! He bought allof you--body, soul and
   spirit--and He must have you, the whole man. Oh, if you are to be
   partly saved by Him and partly by yourselves, then live to yourselves.
   But if God has wholly set you apart to be vessels of mercy fitted for
   His use, do not rob the Lord! Treat not as common cups those things
   which are as the bowls of the altar.

   There is another practical thought here. It was a crime which brought
   destruction upon Babylon when Belshazzar in his drunken frolic cried,
   "Bring forth the cups of the Lord, the goodly spoil of the temple at
   Jerusalem." They brought the golden candlestick and there it stood
   flaming high in the midst of the marble hall. The despot, surrounded by
   his wives and his concubines, filled high the bowl with the foaming
   draught, and bidding them pass round the cups of Jehovah, the heathen,
   the worshippers of idols, drank confusion to the God of Heaven and
   earth.

   In that moment, just as the sacred vessel touched the sacrilegious
   lips, a hand was seen mysteriously writing out his doom--"You are
   weighed in the balances and found wanting." This was the crime which
   filled up the ephah of his sin. Now was the measure of his iniquity
   fully accomplished. He had used for lascivious and drunken purposes,
   vessels which belonged to Jehovah, the God of the whole earth. Oh, take
   heed, take heed, you that profess to be sanctified by the blood of the
   Covenant, that you reckon it not to be an unholy thing! See to it that
   you make not your bodies which you profess to be set apart to God's
   service, slaves of sin, or your members servants of iniquity unto
   iniquity. Lest, O Professors, you should hear in that hour the voice of
   the recording angel as he cries, "You are weighed in the balances and
   found wanting."

   Be you clean, you that bear the vessels of the Lord. And you Beloved
   who hope that you are Christ's. and have a humble faith in Him this
   morning, see that you walk circumspectly, that by no means you
   prostitute to the service of sin that which was set apart in the
   eternal Covenant of Grace to be God's. alone. If you and I are tempted
   to sin, we must reply, No! Let another man do that, but I cannot. I am
   God's man. I am set apart for Him--how shall I do this great wickedness
   and sin against God? Let dedication enforce sanctification. Think of
   the dignity to which God has called you--Jehovah's vessels, set apart
   for the Master's use.

   Far from you, far from you be everything which would make you impure.
   When Antiochus Epiphanes offered a sow on the altar of the Lord in the
   temple at Jerusalem, his awful death might have been easily foretold.
   Oh, how many there are who make a high profession who have offered
   unclean flesh upon the altars of God! So many have made religion a
   stalking-horse to their own emolument, and espoused the faith to gain
   esteem and applause among men! What says the Lord concerning such?
   "Vengeance belongs unto Me, I will recompense says the Lord" (Heb.
   10:30).

   Their god was their belly. They gloried in their shame. They minded
   earthly things--and they die justly accursed. Spots are they in your
   solemn feasts--wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of
   darkness forever. But, you Beloved, be not carried away with the error
   of the wicked--keep yourselves unspotted from the world.

   II. Secondly, in the Old Testament, the word "sanctify" is now and then
   used in another sense, one which I do not perceive to be hinted at in
   our Biblical Encyclopedias, but which is needed to make the subject
   complete. The word "sanctify" is used, not only to signify that the
   thing is set apart for holy uses but that it is to be regarded,
   treated, and declared as a holy thing. To give you an instance. There
   is a passage in Isaiah 8:13, which is to the point, when it is
   said--"Sanctify the Lord of Hosts, Himself."

   You clearly perceive that the Lord does not need to be set apart for
   holy uses. And the Lord of Hosts needs not to be purified, for He is
   Holiness itself. It means adore and reverence the Lord--with fear and
   trembling approach His throne--regard Him as the Holy One of Israel.
   But let me give you other instances. When Nadab and Abihu, as recorded
   in the tenth of Leviticus, offered sacrifice to God, and put strange
   fire on the altar, the fire of the Lord went forth and consumed them.
   And this was the reason given--"I will be sanctified in them that come
   near Me."

   The Lord did not mean that He would be set apart, nor that He would be
   made holy by purification, but that He would be treated and regarded as
   a most Holy Being with whom such liberties were not to be taken. And
   again in Numbers 20:12, on that unfortunate occasion when Moses lost
   his temper and smote the rock twice, saying, "Hear now, you rebels,
   must we fetch you water out of this rock?" The Lord said that he should
   seethe promised land but should never enter it, the reason
   being--"Because you believed Me not, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the
   children of Israel."

   By which He meant that Moses had not acted as to honor God's name among
   the people. A yet more familiar instance occurs in what is commonly
   called "The Lord's Prayer." "Our Father which are in Heaven, sanctified
   be Your name." The word "hallowed" is simply an English variation, the
   Greek is "sanctifiedbe Your name." Now we know that God's name does not
   need purifying, or setting apart--so that the sense here can only be,
   "Let Your name be reverenced and adored throughout the whole earth and
   let men regard it as being a sacred and holy thing."

   My beloved Brethren, have we not some light here concerning our second
   text--"Sanctified in Christ Jesus." If the word "sanctified" may mean
   "regarded as holy and treated as such," can you not see how in Christ
   Jesus the saints are regarded by God as being holy and treated as such?
   Mark, we do not lay that down as being the onlymeaning of the text, for
   we shall have to show that another sense may be attached to it.

   There are Brethren who have enlarged upon our being sanctified in
   Christ and have almost forgotten the work of the Spirit. Now, if they
   only speak of our being sanctified in Christ, in the sense of being
   treated as holy, in fact as being justified, we have no quarrel with
   them. But if they deny the work of the Spirit, they are guilty of
   deadly error. I have sometimes heard the term used, "imputed
   sanctification," which is sheer absurdity. You cannot even use the
   term, "imputed justification." "Imputed righteousness" is correct
   enough and implies a glorious doctrine.

   But justification is not imputed, it is actually conferred. We are
   justified through the imputed righteousness of Christ, but as to being
   imputedly sanctified, no one who understands the use of language can so
   speak. The term is inaccurate and unscriptural. I know it is said that
   the Lord Jesus is made of God unto us, wisdom, righteousness,
   sanctification and redemption. But this sanctification is not by
   imputation, nor does the text say so. Why, you might as readily prove
   imputed wisdom, or imputed redemptionby this text, as force it to teach
   imputed sanctification!

   It is a fact that for the sake of what Jesus Christ did, God's people,
   though in themselves partially'sanctified and being yet subject to sin,
   are for Christ's sake treated and regarded as if they were perfectly
   holy. But this, according to theological definitions, is rather
   justification than sanctification. It must, however, be admitted that
   the Scripture sometimes uses the word "sanctification" in such a manner
   as to make it tantamount to justification. This, however, we can
   clearly see, that God's people have access with boldness to the Lord,
   because they are regarded through Christ as though they were perfectly
   holy.

   Oh, Brethren, think of this for a moment. A holy God cannot have
   dealings with unholy men. A holy God--and is not Christ Jesus
   God?--cannot have communion with unholiness, and yet you and I are
   unholy. How, then, does Christ receive us to His bosom? How does His
   Father walk with us and find Himself agreed? Because He views us, not
   in ourselves, but in our great federal Head, the Second Adam. He looks
   at us--

   "Not as we were in Adam's fall,
   When sin and ruin covered all;
   But as we'll stand another day,
   Fairer than sun's meridian ray." He looks on the deeds of Christ as
   ours--on His perfect obedience and sinless life as ours, and thus we
   may sing in the language of Hart--
   " With your spotless garments on, Holy as the Holy One."

   We may boldly enter into that which is within the veil, where no unholy
   thing may come, yet where we may venture because God views us as holy
   in Christ Jesus. This is a great and precious doctrine. But still,
   since the use of the term "sanctification" in any other sense than that
   in which it is commonly employed as meaning the work of the Spirit,
   tends to foster confused notions and really does, I fear, lead some to
   despise the work of the Spirit of God, I think it is better in ordinary
   conversation between Christians to speak of sanctification without
   confounding it with what is quite a distinct act, namely, justification
   through the imputed righteousness of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

   Yet, if we hear a Brother so talk, we must not be too severe upon him,
   as though he assuredly erred from the faith, for in Scripture, the
   terms "sanctification" and "justification" are frequently used
   interchangeably and Christ's righteousness made the subject matter of
   both works of Divine Grace.

   III. We now come to the usual sense in which the word "sanctification"
   is employed. It means actually to purify or make holy. Not merely to
   set apart nor to account holy, but to make really and actually so in
   nature. You have the word in this sense in many places in the Old
   Testament. You will find it in Exodus 19:10, 11, 12. On the third day
   God was about to proclaim on the top of Sinai His Holy Law and the
   mandate went forth, "Sanctify the people today and tomorrow," which
   sanctification consisted in certain outward deeds by which their bodies
   and clothes were put into a clean state and their souls were brought
   into a reverential state of awe.

   In the third of Joshua you find when the children of Israel were about
   to pass the Jordan, it was said, "Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the
   Lord will do wonders among you." They were to prepare themselves to be
   beholders of a scene so august--when Jordan was driven back and the
   river was utterly dried up before the feet of the priests of God. There
   was in this case an actual purification. Men in the old times were
   sprinkled with blood and thus sanctified from defilement and considered
   to be pure in the sight of God.

   Now this is the sense in which we view our third text, "Sanctification
   through the Spirit," and this, I repeat, is the general sense in which
   we understand it in common conversation among Christian men.

   Sanctification beginsin regeneration. The Spirit of God infuses into
   man the new principle called the spirit, which is a third and higher
   nature, so that the believing man becomes body, soul and spirit. And in
   this he is distinct and distinguished from all other men of the race of
   Adam. This work, which begins in regeneration, is carried on in two
   ways--by vivification and by mortification. That is, by giving life to
   that which is good, and by sending death to that which is evil in the
   man. Mortification, whereby the lusts of the flesh are subdued and kept
   under. And vivification, by which the life which God has put within us
   is made to be a well of water springing up unto everlasting life.

   This is carried on every day in what we call perseverance, by which the
   Christian is preserved and continued in a gracious state, and is made
   to abound in good works unto the praise and glory of God. And it
   culminates, or comes to perfection, in "Glory," when the soul, being
   thoroughly purged, is caught up to dwell with holy beings at the right
   hand of the Majesty on High. Now, this work, though we commonly speak
   of it as being the work of the Spirit, is quite as much the work of the
   Lord Jesus Christ as of the Spirit.

   In looking for texts on the subject, I have been struck with the fact
   that where I found one verse speaking of it as the Spirit's work, I
   found another in which it was treated as the work of Jesus Christ. I
   can well understand that my second text, "Sanctified in Christ Jesus,"
   has as great a fullness of meaning as the third, "Sanctification
   through the Spirit." Lend me your attention. I fear that not many of
   you will be interested, except those of you who have a share in this
   precious work. Others may think the subject too dry for them. Oh that
   they may yet know how precious to Believers is the purifying work of
   sanctification!

   Sanctification is a work in us, not a work for us. It is a work in us
   and there are two agents--one is the Worker who works this
   sanctification effectually--that is the Spirit. And the other, the
   Agent, the efficacious means by which the Spirit works this
   sanctification--Jesus Christ and His most precious blood. Suppose, to
   put it as plainly as we can, there is a garment which needs to be
   washed. Here is a person to wash it, and there is a bath in which it is
   to be washed. The Person is the Holy Spirit but the bath is the
   precious blood of Christ. It is strictly correct to speak of the Person
   cleansing, as being the Sanctifer--it is quite as accurate to speak of
   that which is in the bath and which makes it clean as being the
   Sanctifier, too.

   Now, the Spirit of God sanctifies us. He works it effectively. But He
   sanctifies us through the blood of Christ, through the water which
   flowed with the blood from Christ's side. To repeat my
   illustration--here is a garment which is black. A fuller, in order to
   make it white, uses niter and soap, both the fuller and the soap are
   cleansers. So both the Holy Spirit and the atonement of Christ are
   Sanctifiers. I think that will be plain enough.

   Let us enlarge upon the doctrine. The Spirit of God is the great Worker
   by whom we are cleansed. I shall not, this morning, quote the texts.
   Most of you have the "Baptist Confession of Faith," published by
   Passmore and Alabaster. And the "Catechism," which are generally
   distributed among the families of the Church. They will furnish you
   with abundance of texts on that subject, for this is a doctrine which
   is generally received among us--that it is the Spirit of God who
   creates in us a new heart and a right spirit, according to the tenor of
   the Covenant--"A new heart will I give them and a right spirit will I
   put within them." "I will put My Spirit within them, and they shall
   walk in My ways."

   He renews and changes the nature--turns the bias of the will--makes us
   seek after that which is good and right, so that every good thing in us
   may be described as "the fruit of the Spirit." And all our virtues and
   all our Graces are efficiently worked in us by the Spirit of the living
   God. Never, I pray you, Brethren, never, never forget this! Oh, it will
   be an ill day for any Church when the members begin to think lightly of
   the work of the Holy Spirit within us! We delight to magnify the work
   of Christ for us, but we must not depreciate the work of the blessed
   Spirit in us.

   In the days of my venerable predecessor, Dr. Gill, who was in the
   opinion, even of ultra-Calvinists, sound to the core, this pernicious
   evil broke out in our Church. There were some who believed in what was,
   "Imputed Sanctification," and denied the work of the blessed Spirit. I
   was reading last night in our old Church Book, a note written there in
   the doctor's own handwriting, as the deliberate opinion of this
   Church--

   "Agreed--That to deny the internal sanctification of the Spirit, as a
   principle of Divine Grace and holiness worked in the heart, or as
   consisting of Divine Grace communicated to and implanted in the soul,
   which, though but a begun work and as yet incomplete, is an abiding
   work of Grace and will abide, notwithstanding all corruptions,
   temptations and snares, and be performed by the Author of it until the
   day of Christ, when it will be the saints' meetness for eternal
   glory--is a grievous error, which highly reflects dishonor on the
   blessed Spirit and His operations of Grace on the heart, is subversive
   of true religion and powerful godliness and renders persons unfit for
   Church communion.

   "Why, it is further agreed, that such persons who appear to have
   embraced this error be not admitted to the communion of this Church.
   And should any such who are members of it appear to have received it
   and continued in it, that they be forthwith excluded from it." Two
   members then present declaring themselves to be of the opinion
   condemned in the above resolution and also a third person who was
   absent but who was well known to have been under this awful delusion,
   were consequently excluded that evening.

   No, more, a person of another Church who held the opinion thus
   condemned, was forbidden to commune at the Table, and his pastor at
   Kettering was written to upon the subject, warning him not to allow so
   great an errorist to remain in fellowship. The doctor thought the error
   to be so deadly that he used the pruning knife at once. He did not stop
   till it spread, but he cut off the very twigs. And this is one of the
   benefits of Church discipline when we are enabled to carry it out under
   God--that it does nip error in the very bud--and thus those who as yet
   are not infected are kept from it by the blessed Providence of God
   through the instrumentality of the Church.

   We have always held, and still hold and teach that the work of the
   Spirit in us, whereby we are conformed unto Christ's image, is as
   absolutely necessary for our salvation, as is the work of Jesus Christ,
   by which He cleanses us from our sins.

   Pause here one moment and let me not distract your minds while I say
   that while the Spirit of God is said in Scripture to be the Author of
   sanctification, yet there is a visible agent which must not be
   forgotten. "Sanctify them," said Christ, through Your truth Your Word
   is truth." Young men of the Bible Class, look up the passages of
   Scripture which prove that the instrument of our sanctification is the
   Word of God. You will find that there are very many. It is the Word of
   God which sanctifies the soul. The Spirit of God brings to our minds
   the commands and precepts and doctrines of the Truths of God and
   applies them with power.

   These are heard in the ear, and being received in the heart, they work
   in us to will and to do of God's good pleasure. How important, then,
   that the Truths of God should be preached. How necessary that you never
   tolerate a ministry which leaves out the great doctrines or the great
   precepts of the Gospel. The Truth of God is the Sanctifier and if we do
   not hear the Truth, depend upon it, we shall not grow in
   sanctification. We only progress in sound living as we progress in
   sound understanding. "Your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto
   my paths."

   Do not say of such-and-such an error, "Oh, it is a mere matter of
   opinion." If it is a mere matter of opinion today, it will be a matter
   of practice tomorrow. No man has an error of judgment, without sooner
   or later having an error in practice. As every grain of Truth is a
   grain of diamond dust, prize it all. Hold fast the Truths of God which
   you have received and which you have been taught. "Hold fast the form
   of sound words." And in this day when articles are ridiculed, when
   creeds are despised--hold fast to that which you have received that you
   may be found faithful among the faithless. For by so holding the Truth
   of God shall you be sanctified by the Spirit of God. The Agent, then,
   is the Spirit of God working through the Truth.

   But now let me bring you back to my old figure. In another sense we are
   sanctified through Christ Jesus, because it is His blood and the water
   which flowed from His side in which the Spirit washes our heart from
   the defilement and propensity of sin. It is said of our Lord--"Christ
   also loved the Church and gave Himself for it. That He might sanctify
   and cleanse it with the washing of water by the Word, that He might
   present it to Himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle or
   any such thing."

   Remember again, "Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His
   own blood, suffered without the gate." "He that sanctifies and they who
   are sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not ashamed to
   call them Brethren." I say again, there are hundreds of texts of this
   kind. "You shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people from
   their sins." "God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto
   the world."

   In that memorable passage where Paul, struggling with corruption,
   exclaims, "Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
   body of this death?"--the answer is not concerning the Holy Spirit. But
   he says, "I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." Space forbids the
   multiplication of texts. But there are many passages to the effect that
   our sanctification is the work of Jesus Christ. He is our Sanctifier,
   for He filled the sacred laver of regeneration in which we are washed,
   filled it with His blood and with the water which flowed from His
   side--and in this, by the Holy Spirit, we are washed.

   There is no being sanctified by the Law. The Spirit does not use legal
   precepts to sanctify us--there is no purification by mere dictates of
   morality--the Spirit of God does not use them. No, just as when Marah's
   waters were bitter, Moses, to make them sweet, commanded them to take a
   tree and cast it into the waters, and they were sweet, so the Spirit of
   God, finding our natures bitter, takes the tree of Calvary, casts it
   into the stream, and everything is made pure. He finds us lepers, and
   to make us clean He dips the hyssop of faith in the precious blood and
   sprinkles it upon us and we are clean.

   There is a mysterious efficacy in the blood of Christ not merely to
   make satisfaction for sin but to work the death of sin. The blood
   appears before God and He is well-pleased. It falls on us--lusts wither
   and old corruptions feel the death stroke. Dagon falls before the ark
   and although the stump is left and corruptions still remain, yet Christ
   shall put an end to all our inbred sins and through Him we shall mount
   to Heaven perfect, even as our Father, which is in Heaven, is perfect.

   Just as the Spirit only works through the Truth, so the blood of Christ
   only works through faith Young men of the Catechumen and Bible Classes,
   again I say, turn to your Bibles at your leisure and look up the many
   passages which speak of faith as sanctifying the soul and purifying the
   mind. Our faith lays hold on the precious atonement of Christ. It sees

   Jesus suffering on the tree and it says--"I vow revenge against the
   sins which nailed Him there." And thus His precious blood works in us a
   detestation of all sin and the Spirit, through the Truth of God,
   working by faith, applies the precious blood of sprinkling--and we are
   made clean and are accepted in the Beloved.

   I am afraid that I have confused and darkened counsel with words. But,
   I think I may have suggested some trains of thought which will lead you
   to see that Holy Scripture teaches us a sanctification, not narrow and
   concise, so as to be written down with a short definition as in our
   creed books--but wide, large and expansive. A work in which we are
   sanctified byGod the Father, sanctified inChrist, and yet have our
   sanctification through the Spirit of God.

   Oh, my dear Hearers, strive after practical holiness. You that love
   Christ, do not let any say of you--"There is a Christian, but he is
   worse than other men." It is not our eloquence, our learning, our fame,
   or our wealth, that can ever commend Christ to the world--it is the
   holy living of Christians. I was speaking, the other day, to a Brother
   minister about this Bi-centenary movement, which I fear will be an
   immense injury to Christ's Church. I feared, lest it should be made an
   opportunity for strife among Brethren. Error must be corrected but love
   must not be wounded.

   He remarked, and I thought it was so truthful, that the only way by
   which Dissent flourished of old was by the then superior holiness of
   its ministers, so that while the Church clergyman was hunting, the
   Dissenting minister was visiting the sick. And said he, "This is the
   way in which we shall lose power, if our ministers become political and
   worldly, it will be all over with us." I have never shunned to rebuke,
   when I thought it necessary, but I hate contention. The only allowable
   strife is to labor who can be the most holy, the most earnest, the most
   zealous--who can do the most for the poor and the ignorant--and who can
   lift Christ's Cross the highest.

   That is the way to lift up the members of any one particular
   denomination--by the members of that body being more devout, more
   sanctified, more spiritual-minded than others. All mere party fights
   will only create strife, animosities, and bickering--and are not of the
   Spirit of God. But to live unto God and to be devoted to Him--this is
   the strength of the Church. This will give us the victory, God helping
   us--and unto His name shall be all the praise.

   As for persons here who are not converted and are unregenerate, I
   cannot address you about sanctification. I have opened a door this
   morning, but you cannot enter. Only remember, that if you cannot enter
   into this, you cannot enter into Heaven, for--

   "Those holy gates forever bar
   Pollution, sin and shame. None shall obtain admission there, But
   followers of the Lamb."

   May it be yours, by God's Grace, to come humbly and confess your sins
   and ask and find forgiveness. And then, but not till then, there is
   hope that you may be sanctified in the Spirit of your mind. The Lord
   bless you for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                               Obtaining Promises

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 16, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Who through faith obtained promises." Hebrews 11:33.
   THE promises of God are to the Believer an inexhaustible mine of
   wealth. Happy is it for him if he knows how to search out their secret
   veins and enrich himself with their hidden treasures. They are to him
   an armory containing all manner of offensive and defensive weapons.
   Blessed is he who has learned to enter into the sacred arsenal, to put
   on the breastplate, and the helmet, and to lay his hand to the spear
   and to the sword. They are to the Believer a surgery in which he will
   find all manner of restoratives and blessed elixirs. He shall find in
   them an ointment for every wound, a cordial for every faintness, a
   remedy for every disease. Blessed is he who is well skilled in heavenly
   pharmacy and knows how to lay hold on the healing virtues of the
   promises of God!
   The promises are to the Christian a storehouse of food. They are as the
   granaries which Joseph built in Egypt, or as the golden pot wherein the
   fresh manna was preserved. Blessed is he who can take the five barley
   loaves and fishes of promise and break them till his five thousand
   necessities shall all be supplied, and he is able to gather up baskets
   full of fragments. The promises are the Christian's Magna Charta of
   liberty--they are the title deeds of his heavenly estate. Happy is he
   who knows how to read them well and call them all his own.
   Yes, they are the jewel room in which the Christian's crown-treasures
   are preserved--the regalia--secretly his today, but which he shall
   openly wear in Paradise. He is already a king who has the silver key
   with which to unlock the strong room. He may even now grasp the
   scepter, wear the crown and put upon his shoulders the imperial mantle.
   O how unutterably rich are the promises of our faithful,
   Covenant-keeping God! If we had here the tongue of the mightiest of
   human orators, and if that tongue could be touched with a live coal
   from off the altar, yet still it could not utter a tenth of the praises
   of the exceeding great and precious promises of God!
   No, they who have entered into rest and have had their tongues attuned
   to the lofty and rapturous eloquence of cherubim and seraphim--even
   they can never tell the height and depth, the length and breadth of the
   unsearchable riches of Christ which are stored up in the treasure house
   of God--the promises of the Covenant of His Divine Grace.
   See, then, my Brethren, how necessary it is that you and I should know
   the heavenly art of, by faith, "obtaining promises." Furthermore, all
   things under the Covenant of Grace are by promise. The Law had
   blessings for works. What shall I say? It had only curses for
   transgressors, since the blessings were never obtained by any who were
   under the Law. But the Covenant of Grace says not, "Do this and live,"
   but it says, "I will," and "you shall." It says not, "He that does
   these things shall live by them," but, "at such-and-such a time will I
   visit you and you shall be blessed."

   Mention anything you will which is contained in the Covenant and I will
   show it is by promise. Do we speak of adoption? "Now we, Brethren, as
   Isaac was, are the children of promise." "They which are the children
   of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of
   the promise, these are counted for the seed." Do you speak of
   inheritance? Then, "God gave it to Abraham by promise," we are the
   "heirs of promise." "And this is the promise that He has promised us,
   even eternal life." The Covenants are described by Paul as being, the
   "Covenants of promise."

   Even the Gospel, itself, is in the first chapter of the Romans, at the
   second verse, spoken of as "the Gospel of God, which He had promised
   afore by His Prophets in the Holy Scriptures." Life eternal is
   described as the "promise of eternal life." We, Brethren, look for the
   "promise of His coming." And after that, we, "according to His promise
   look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwells righteousness." If
   we should begin at the beginning and run on till we come to the close
   of the catalog of Divine blessings which are bestowed upon us through
   Grace, we might say of them all, "These are promised Covenant mercies."

   How necessary then--in what a tenfold degree is it absolutely necessary
   that you and I should know how to obtain the promises and see them
   fulfilled. For if not, failing to obtain the promises, we have lost all
   things and are of all men the most miserable.

   I would try, this morning to explain the text, understanding it in two
   senses. First, some reader might think it means obtaining the promises
   in themselves. Perhaps, a more thoughtful reader would perceive that it
   may be better understood as obtaining the fulfillment of the promises.
   The phrase means certainly both, but we think that the mind of the
   Spirit is most fully expressed by the second sense.

   I. It is certain that holy men of old, and that good men now, do BY
   FAITH, OBTAIN PROMISES.

   Let us give you an instance--the memorable case of Abraham. Abraham is
   bid by God to offer up his son Isaac. He was already an heir of the
   promises, but not as yet had they been revealed to him in their utmost
   length and breadth. Obedient to the Divine command, Abraham prepares to
   offer up his son Isaac, his only son, on whom his hope of posterity
   depended, counting that God was able either of stones to raise up
   children, or to raise up Isaac again from the dead. He unsheathes the
   knife to slay his son.

   He is prevented from the consummation of the deed. God accepts his
   sacrifice and rewards it with a promise. If you will at your leisure
   read in Genesis 22, commencing at the fifteenth verse and proceeding
   onwards, you will see it was then that God conferred on Abraham that
   great charter wherein it was written, "In blessing I will bless you and
   in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the Heaven and
   as the sand which is upon the seashore. And your seed shall possess the
   gate of his enemies. And in your seed shall all the nations of the
   earth be blessed. Because you have obeyed My voice."

   Now, it was his act of faith which, not meritoriously, but of Divine
   Grace, obtained that noble promise. Brethren, if you would obtain a
   promise, your faith must do exploits. When you have made some sacrifice
   for God, and have been willing in the ties of human reason to do God's
   will as God bids you, you shall then stand on a vantage ground from
   which you may reach another and a higher promise than as yet you have
   ever been able to grasp in the hand of your faith.

   It is true the promise is not through the Law but through the
   righteousness of faith. But to him, who like Abraham, staggers not at
   the promise through unbelief, it shall surely be given to be "heir of
   the world." To him that has, shall be given, and he shall have
   abundantly. The Spirit of God shall whisper into your soul some promise
   which shall come home with as much power to you as though an angel from
   Heaven had spoken it to you. And you shall, through one act of faith,
   obtain the promise which before was beyond your reach.

   Another notable instance is given us in the case of David, where it was
   not so much faith, as an act consequent upon faith, which brought him
   the promise, namely, a noble wish to serve God by building a house for
   Him. David had been storing up much gold and silver that he might build
   a house for God, for he said, "Behold I dwell in a house of cedar but
   the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord remains under curtains." He was not
   permitted to build the house, but as a reward for his desire to do this
   for his God, Nathan was sent and then it was that the Covenant was made
   with David, in which he rejoiced even when expiring, because it was
   "ordered in all things and sure."

   Then Nathan said to him, "And it shall come to pass, when your days are
   expired that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will raise up
   your seed after you, which shall be of your sons. And I will establish
   his kingdom. He shall build Me an house and I will establish his throne
   forever. I will be his Father and he shall be My son. And I will not
   take My mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before you:
   but I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom forever: and his
   throne shall be established forever more."

   Now, Brethren, if you and I would obtain the promise, if we would have
   them spoken home to us with a force as great as if they consisted of
   novel words for the first time uttered by some seraphic lips, we must
   resolve to do some great thing for God. And He who expects the
   Grace-indicted wishes of His children, will in return lead them into
   some inner chamber of new delights which they had not known before. To
   quote yet another instance. Joshua was about to invade the land of
   Canaan, and therefore before his arduous enterprise the Lord gave him a
   new promise. His faith led him to the brink of Jordan, the borders of
   the promise land, and then and there he, by faith, obtained a blessed
   promise, which we will read for our comfort, remembering that venturing
   in the path of duty upon great enterprises, we may expect like he to
   win new promises.

   "There shall not any man be able to stand before you all the days of
   your life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with you: I will not fail
   you, nor forsake you. Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this
   people shall you divide for an inheritance the land, which I swore unto
   their fathers to give them. Only be strong and very courageous, that
   you may observe to do according to all the Law, which Moses My servant
   commanded you: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that
   you may prosper where ever you go.

   "This book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth. But you shall
   meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to
   all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way
   prosperous and then you shall have good success. Have not I commanded
   you? Be strong and of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be you
   dismayed: for the Lord your God is with you where ever you go."

   One more instance may not be amiss. God sometimes gives His people
   fresh promises by faith just before a trial is about to come upon them.
   It was so with Elijah. God said to him, "Go to the brook Cherith,
   behold I have commanded the ravens to feed you there." This was at the
   beginning of the famine. There he abode and God fulfilled the promise,
   for by faith Elijah had obtained it. Acting upon faith, still dependent
   upon God, he abides at Cherith, and as the result of this faith, God
   gives him a fresh promise, "Arise, get you to Zarephath: I have
   commanded a widow woman there to sustain you."

   The faith which received the first promise obtained the honor of a
   second. So with you and with me. If we have had a little promise, and
   up till now have realized it. If we have lived upon it, and made it the
   stay and support of our souls, surely God will give us another and a
   greater one and so, from promise to promise, speeding our way, we shall
   find the promises to be rungs of the ladder which Jacob saw--the top
   whereof shall reach to Heaven. Doubt and be distrustful about the
   promise that you have, and you cannot expect God to increase His
   Revelation to your soul.

   Be afraid, stagger through unbelief at that which was laid to your
   heart yesterday and you shall not have a new one tomorrow. Oh, that we
   had power to act as Samson did, who, having the promise of God that he
   should smite the Philis-tines--with the jaw-bone of an ass laid them
   heaps on heaps, never reckoning the odds, but having God with him in
   child-like simple faith--he dashed upon his foes and overcame them. We
   should go from strength to strength, receiving Grace upon Grace if we
   had faith to mount from promise to promise.

   But, I hear someone say, "is there such a thing as receiving promises
   now? They are in the Bible and we can read them, but can they ever come
   to us as if they were our own?" Oh, yes, dear Friends, and that is the
   best way in which God's people get at the sweetness of them. I believe
   in God the Holy Spirit. I believe in His immediate operations in the
   soul of man. This is the dispensation of the Holy Spirit and would
   therefore be strange if He did not speak in us, now, as much as in the
   age of types and shadows.

   I am not a disciple of the Quakers, although I believe I am a
   descendant of one of their early martyrs, but in some matters I
   heartily agree with them, as, for instance, in their testimony to the
   special and direct monitions, directions, and illuminations of the Holy
   Spirit. Surely, I know that God the Holy Spirit has dealings with His
   people today, as much as ever He had with the Prophets of old. There
   are times when He takes an old text out of the Word and re-writes it
   upon their souls, so that it is as really a Revelation fresh from
   Heaven, as though it had never been written in that Book before.

   Bilney, that blessed martyr of Jesus Christ, was much wounded in
   conscience, by reason of the great sin which, through the weakness of
   the flesh, he had committed, by subscribing to Popish errors. At that
   time he could get no comfort of soul because of his deep and continual
   sense of sin. The Spirit of God took this text and made it a balm for
   all his wounds, "This is a faithful saying and worthy of all
   acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of
   whom I am chief."

   Bilney kept that. Believing it to be as much his own as if it had never
   been uttered by Paul, he went to the stake and burned right bravely for
   Christ, in the strength of the promise so opportunely given to him.
   Beza says that once, when he had been long in great sorrow and deep
   distress, this text came with power to him--"My sheep hear My voice and
   I know them and they follow Me, and I give unto them eternal life and
   they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My
   hand. My Father, which gave them Me, is greater than all. And no man is
   able to pluck them out of My Father's hand."

   Mr. Calamy gives us an instance of a young woman who died triumphantly,
   being sustained by that well-known word of our Divine Lord, "Come unto
   Me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest."
   That man of

   God, Watts Wilkinson, spoke of that promise, "What I do, you know not
   now, but you shall know hereafter," as being often a very sweet
   consolation to him in mysterious dispensations of Providence. It is not
   for me to speak at any length of what texts have been my own. But there
   have been turning points in my history in which I have had promises
   from God which have been to me as marked and as distinctly from Heaven
   as if they had been spoken by seer or Prophet who met me in the way.

   Never shall I forget one instance, which accounts for my being here at
   this very hour. When I had resolved to enter college, walking across
   Midsummer Common, just outside of Cambridge, revolving in my mind the
   joys of scholarship and the hope of being something in the world, that
   text came to my heart, "Seek you great things for yourself? Seek them
   not." "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all
   these things shall be added unto you."

   All was given up. Everything was renounced, the finest prospects seemed
   to melt into thin air, merely on the strength of that text, believing
   that God, even our God, would most certainly fulfill to me His promise
   if I could keep His precept. Now, if I had told that to another, he
   might have laughed--but to me it was as solemnly the Word of God as if
   the heavens had opened and I had seen them written out in lightning
   flashes, or heard the thunders of God roll through the sky.

   I suppose some of you have known the same. One other instance I cannot
   fail to narrate. When the cholera was here last time, I wended my way
   from house to house among the sick and dying. I was one day sad at
   heart and thought surely my own time was come, for I had seen many
   deaths and had been at many graves. Walking down the Dover Road, I saw
   in a window, upon a paper fastened to the glass with four wafers, this
   verse--"Because you have made the Lord, even the Most High, your
   habitation, there shall no evil befall you, neither shall any plague
   come near your dwelling."

   I stopped, attracted by the paper in the window and read it. And this
   verse I am certain was as much a Revelation to my own heart, and I as
   much obtained that promise as though an angel had brought it with swift
   wings from on high. Your experience, Brother and Sister Christians,
   will furnish similar instances. We may be sneered at as fanatics by
   those who do not understand spiritual impressions from the Holy Spirit,
   but we know, and we speak only of what we have tasted and handled of
   the good Word of God. There is such a thing as still obtaining the
   promise afresh from Heaven-- money from the mint of God like new coin
   all unworn. Faith, and faith, alone, can know the secret of obtaining
   promises.

   Thus I have tried to explain the first meaning of the text.

   II. As for the second meaning, it is somewhat more practical. By faith
   these men obtained not merely the giving of the promise but, THE
   FULFILLMENT OF IT.

   Now, I shall want your earnest attention, and I hope also your memories
   will be at work while I try to give some practical regulations for
   obtaining the fulfillment of the promise. Some persons, however, who
   have bad memories may think they will get no good. I remember what an
   old preacher once did when visited by one of his members who said he
   feared he gained no good, for his memory was bad. In the opinion of all
   who saw his holy and heavenly walk, he was one of the most profitable
   of hearers.

   Two dirty glasses were produced, and into one of them the minister
   poured water and after rinsing a while, he poured it out again and
   setting it down by the side of the other, he said, "Has not the water
   had effect even though none remains? So let us hope that you may get
   good even should your memory retain but very little."

   God's promises may be divided into two classes. Some of them are
   unconditional. They are promises of Divine Grace, and of these, faith
   does not obtain the fulfillment--God fulfils them according to His own
   sovereign will and pleasure-- according to the purpose of His Grace. I
   mean promises such as those which relate to the calling of the elect at
   God's time, their being brought out from death to life. Their
   quickening, their conviction, and regeneration. Now, man being, before
   Divine Grace, utterly dead, powerless, and lifeless--it is clear that
   no faith on his part obtains these promises nor even helps to obtain
   them. But God, when the predestinated hour is come, says, "it is a time
   of love," and beholding the infant cast out and in its blood, He says
   unto it, "Live!"

   I ought to add, indeed, that even those promises which might be called
   conditional, are only conditional in a certain sense. For whereas they
   are conditional in one passage of Scripture, you find them
   unconditional in another. They are conditional only in the order of our
   attainment and enjoyment of them. But in the plan, purpose, and decree
   of God, they are all based on unconditional oaths and declarations of
   eternal love. God says, "I will" and "they shall"--and here the
   promises all rest.

   With regard to many of the promises which have some sort of description
   appended to them, we must by faith answer the description, or we cannot
   claim the blessing. Most of them have this condition--"For these things
   will I be inquired of by the house of Israel to do it for them." There
   are three ways of "obtaining the promise." Many of them only need the
   outstretched hand to grasp them. You may go with believing faith at
   once and take the promise, "Ask and you shall receive." There are many
   of the promises so readily attainable, that if you are in Christ, you
   may, this morning, see them fulfilled by simply believing them.

   Believe them to be true and you shall have what they promise you. Some
   of God's promises are like checks--you present them at the counter--and
   the cash is given. You have but to take the promise stamped by God's
   own hand, signed and sealed, believe it to be God's, and you shall have
   the mercy now. This is true of a very large number of the promises. Of
   some others I must give a second direction. You must not simply believe
   them but exercise importunate prayer about them. "Knock and it shall be
   opened."

   These promises are not to be had for the mere believing. Of some kind
   of devils it was said, "This kind goes not out but with prayer and
   fasting." Of some sort of promises it may be said, "This kind is not
   fulfilled but by prayer and importunity." You must knock, and if the
   gate opens not, you must knock again and continue to do so until God
   shall give you the favor. You are certain to have the blessing if you
   know how to wrestle with the angel and declare that you will not let
   him go unless he shall bestow it upon you.

   A third kind of these promises are not even to be fulfilled by prayer
   or by faith alone. You must obtain them by earnest seeking after them.
   "Seek and you shall find." Where God has appended to the promise a
   something that is to be done, diligently do it, and you shall obtain
   the blessing. I hold in my hand a book which is very precious to me. It
   is my treasure house, next to the Bible the most valuable. Indeed,
   because it is all Scripture--Clarke's Scripture Promises. When I have a
   trial or trouble, since the promises are here all put under different
   heads, I can turn at once and find just the promise I want. There are
   many of these sparkling jewels which cannot be won by prayer, nor be
   obtained by an act of faith alone.

   For instance such as these--"Those things which you have both learned
   and received and heard and seen in Me, do. And the God of peace shall
   be with you." Now, that promise requires something to be done by the
   Christian, and then the God of peace shall be with him. "Blessed are
   they that do His Commandments, that they may have a right to the tree
   of life and may enter in through the gates into the city." If we refuse
   to obey God's Commandments, our faith will be a dead faith, and our
   prayers will be presumption. We must obey the Lord's will and then we
   shall have the blessing. "Whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because
   we keep His Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His
   sight."

   If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love." "Who is among
   you that fears the Lord, that obeys the voice of His servant, that
   walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the
   Lord and stay upon his God." But here, you see, with regard to promises
   of this kind--and they are very numerous, indeed--the act of faith must
   be matured into the work of faith. It is not the bare act of faith that
   gets some promises, not the utterance of faith in prayer. But with
   these there must be the work, and the fruit, and the patience of faith,
   or otherwise the clusters hang too high for our reach.

   Those three rules contain the essence of what I have to say. But to
   guide beginners in the Divine life a little more fully, let us give a
   few other regulations.

   1. Child of God, Babe in Divine Grace, would you like to obtain the
   promises? Take this advice first--meditate much upon them. There are
   promises which are like grapes in the winepress. If you will tread
   them, the juice will flow. Many a time a Believer, when he is like
   Isaac walking in the fields, meditating in the cool of the day upon a
   promise, unexpectedly meets his Rebekah. The blessing which had tarried
   long comes on a sudden home. He sought retirement to meditate upon a
   promise, and lo, "being in the way God met with him." Thinking over the
   hallowed words will often be the means of fulfilling them.

   "I was in the spirit on the Lord's day," says John, "and heard behind
   me a great voice, as of a trumpet." Just so. It was his being in the
   Spirit, his meditating upon spiritual things, that made him ready to
   behold the King in His beauty and to hear what the Spirit says unto the
   Churches. Specially, young Christian, meditate much upon those promises
   which relate personally to Christ. While you are thinking them over,
   the faith which you are seeking will insensibly come to you. That word
   which says, "the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleans us from all
   sin"--think that over, masticate and digest it--and in the very act of
   meditation, faith will be born in your soul!

   Many a man who has thirsted for the promise while he has been
   considering the Divine Record, has found the favor which it ensured,
   gently distilling into his soul--and he has rejoiced that ever he was
   led to lay the promise near his heart. I think it was Martin Luther who
   said that some passages of Scripture are like trees which bear fruit,
   but the fruit does not easily drop. You must get hold of the tree, says
   he, shake it, and shake it again and again! And sometimes you will need
   to exhaust all your strength--but at the last shakedown drops the
   luscious fruit. So do you with the promise, shake it to and fro by
   meditation and the apples of gold will fall. Let the promise, like the
   problem of the philosopher, be revolved in your soul, and at last your
   spirit shall leap for very joy while you say, "I have found it, I have
   found it, the very thing that my soul has sought after!"

   2. Secondly, young man in Christ Jesus, do not only meditate upon the
   promise but seek in your soul to realize it as being the very word of
   God. Say to your soul, "If I were dealing with a man's promise I should
   look most carefully at the man who had covenanted with me. If I had a
   bond or note of hand I should estimate most carefully the credibility,
   the respectability and solvency of the man whose name was endorsed
   thereon. So with the promise of God. My eye must not be so much fixed
   upon the greatness of the mercy--that may stagger me--as upon the
   greatness of the promises--that will cheer me.

   My Soul, it is God, even your God, God that cannot lie, who speaks to
   you. This Word of His which you are now considering is as true as His
   own existence. He is a God unchangeable, and therefore this promise has
   not been revoked. He has not altered the thing which has gone out of
   His mouth, nor called back one single consolatory sentence. Nor does He
   lack any power. It is the God that made the heavens and the earth who
   has spoken to me and said, "Thus and thus will I do."

   Nor will He, nor can He, fail in wisdom as to the time when He will
   bestow the favors, for He knows when best to give and when better to
   withhold. Therefore, seeing that it is the Word of a God so true, so
   immutable, so powerful, so wise--I will and must, by His Grace, believe
   the promise. See, my Brethren, you have already arrived at the faith
   which obtains the promise. I think we ought to be ashamed of ourselves,
   every one of us, that we dare to doubt God.

   Thinking this over the other day a horror of great darkness fell upon
   my soul, while I mourned that ever I should have been guilty of the
   infamous blasphemy of doubting God. To doubt an honest man is to cast a
   slur upon him. But to doubt God, who cannot lie? To doubt God who by an
   oath has sworn? What? Is this to make God a liar, or even a perjurer?
   Our soul shrinks back from infamy so cursed. Did ever fiend in Hell
   commit a more detestable iniquity than that of doubting the veracity of
   a God of perfection and truth?

   Come, Soul, there is the promise. There it stands before you. You say,
   "I dare not believe it." But I say, "How dare you doubt it? From where
   did you get your arrogance? How can you speak so exceedingly proud as
   thus to think of God and say of Him, that He has promised what He
   cannot or what He will not perform? Lay much to heart, then, young
   Christian, the fact that the promise is the very Word of God, and
   surely you will not find it hard to believe and so to obtain the
   promise.

   3. Then, in the third place, be sure that you do, in the power of the
   Spirit of God, what the precept annexed to the promise asks of you.
   Follow the example of Moses. Moses knew that there was a promise given
   to the people of Israel, that they should be the world's blessing. But
   in order to obtain it, it was necessary that Moses should practice
   self-denial. What did he do? He refused to be called the son of
   Pharaoh's daughter, counting it better to suffer the reproach of Christ
   than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. If the promise
   commands you to deny yourself, you can not obtain it without doing so.
   Do it and you have obtained it.

   Or, suppose that the promise requires at your hand courage. Don't be
   afraid. David felt he had a promise from God that He would keep him. He
   knew that in his past experience God had been faithful. "Your servant
   slew both the lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine
   shall be as one of them." He advanced to the conflict and the Lord was
   his Deliverer. Go forth with your sling and your stone, for you will
   never obtain the promise if you are afraid to face your gigantic foe.

   Or does the promise require obedience at your hand? Be obedient.
   Remember how Rahab, the harlot, hung out from her window the scarlet
   line, because that was the test of her faith. So you do the same.
   Whatever Christ has said unto you, do it. Neglect no command, however
   trivial it may seem. What if it is a non-essential! What have you to do
   with that? Do what your Master tells you, asking no questions, for he
   is an ill servant who questions his Lord's commands. Doubtless, you
   too, like the Ethiopian eunuch, shall go on your way rejoicing when you
   have been obedient.

   Or is the promise made to those who bear a good report of the land?
   Remember who Caleb and Joshua were, the only two who obtained the
   promise out of all the host that came out of Egypt, because they alone,
   "faithful among the faithless found" honored God and would not dare to
   distrust Him. So you do the same--honor God. Let a scoffing world hear
   your unvarying testimony that your God is good and true. Let not your
   wretched face whisper to men that you have a hard master. Let not your
   groaning and your murmuring make young men suspect that God is
   tyrannical to His own children, and that they have no joys, no
   comforts, no delights.

   Be not as the hypocrites are, of a sad countenance--bow not your head
   like a bulrush--afflict not your soul, for this is not the service
   which God demands of you. Better the palm branch than the willow.
   Fairer the wedding garment than the mourner's weeds. He whom we serve
   is no Egyptian taskmaster, His yoke is easy, His service pleasure, His
   reward unspeakable. "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say,
   rejoice."

   Be not cast down and troubled, as though the child of God had a cruel
   parent and a miserable home. Lift up your heads, for your redemption
   draws near, and to the timbrel and the harp, march on to the promised
   inheritance of the people of God. So shall you by joy of heart, not
   bringing up an evil report of the land, inherit the promise.

   4. But, fourthly, another rule. Some of the promises you will not
   inherit even so, unless you shall imitate the men who by faith and
   patience inherit the promise. Good old Spurstow says some of the
   promises are like the almond tree, they blossom hastily in the very
   earliest spring. But says he, there are some that are like the mulberry
   tree, they are very slow in putting forth their leaves. Then what is a
   man to do if he has a mulberry tree promise that will not put forth its
   leaves? Why he is to wait till it does. If the vision tarries, wait for
   it till it comes--it will not tarry, the appointed time shall surely
   bring it.

   But some men, because God hears not their prayers today, turn like
   silly children and cannot think that their Father is true. Oh, be men
   and add to your faith, patience. Wait for His coming as the husbandman
   waits for the precious fruit of the earth, knowing that there is a time
   for every purpose under Heaven. And while it is always your time to
   sow, wait till God appoints the time to reap. It is yours now to
   pray--He shall give you your time to dance when you shall rejoice
   because the promise has been fulfilled.

   5. In the next place, take care if you would get the promise, that you
   select one that is suitable to your own case. Being much troubled in
   heart upon one occasion, there was one promise which came home to me.
   It was this--"His soul shall dwell at ease," and in the strength of
   that promise my soul learned to dwell at ease in the midst of reviling
   and misrepresentation and persecutions multiplied. You may find a
   choice word which will meet your condition, that will just suit you.
   Have you had five troubles, six, and seven? What do you say to
   this--"He shall deliver you in six troubles, yes, in seven there shall
   no evil touch you."

   Have you two troubles at once, both of them enough to overwhelm you?
   You have it here, "When you go through the fires you shall not be
   burned." That is one trouble warded off. "When you go through rivers
   they shall not overflow you." Here is another trouble subdued. There
   are two at once, fire and water--one to burn and the other to drown. "I
   will be with you," says He, and that word meets both. Is it
   sickness--"I will make all your bed in your sickness." Is it failure in
   business, crops, harvest and the like? "At destruction and famine you
   shall laugh."

   Or is it death? "Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
   death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me. Your rod and Your
   staff, they comfort me." Get hold of that promise which is suitable to
   your case. You ask, is there one? Why, do you need a list of blessings?
   You have them here in the catalogue of promises--promises of peace,
   honor, success, plenty. Promises of preservation from trouble, support
   under it, deliverance out of it.

   Promises in sickness, child-bearing, old age, famine, want, war,
   slander, reproach. Promises to the stranger, the exile, the poor, the
   helpless, the fatherless, the widow, the prisoner, the captive, the
   dying. Promises of justification, pardon of sin, adoption, union and
   communion with the Church, access to God. Promises of wisdom,
   knowledge, Divine teaching--promises beyond mention! Promises of every
   Grace and of every blessing--we cannot pause to mention them all. The
   fiery sword at the gate of the garden turned every way to keep men out
   of Paradise. Oh, blessed be God, this sword of the Spirit, which is the
   Word of God, turns every way to keep our enemies from breaking our
   peace!

   There are very few medicines which will heal all things. In fact, none.
   But we may say there is a promise in the Scripture for every
   disease--no matter what it may be--there is one meant expressly for
   that case. And if there should be a person who is the only man in the
   world who ever had a certain trouble, still he will find a promise
   exactly to fit his case--for this Inspired Book is an universal
   medicine. Here, O sick souls, are all kinds of remedies, and it is not
   possible that human need should be wider than the Divine supply.

   Still, Brethren, get the one promise that suits you and that one will
   be more useful to you than all the rest. Ahab had a great garden. He
   put Naboth's into it. He had large vineyards, and corn fields, and
   orchards, and subject-kings and tributaries. But Ahab suffered famine.
   There was a poor woman, she had nothing, only a little cruse, that was
   all. No fields, no orchards, no granaries. That one little cruse,
   however, was inexhaustible, and she lacked nothing. Ah, blessed be God!
   There are times with the child of God when everything else is gone--he
   has only one little cruse--one promise left, but that an inexhaustible
   one!

   And he and his house shall live upon it--he shall go in the strength of
   it all the days that the famine shall last. It is not having many
   promises. It is appropriating one, and pleading it before God, that
   shall make us mighty.

   6. Again, young Believer, would you obtain the promise? Then be careful
   that you are thankful for promises you have already obtained. We must
   thank God for the mercies we have, or else we shall not have others. In
   the early days when the Puritans settled in New England they were
   always having fast days. They had a fast day because their bread was
   getting short. Another fast day because the Indians invaded them.
   Another fast day because a ship had not arrived that they expected. And
   they had so many fast days that they began to get exceedingly weak.

   At length, one very wise Brother said, "Don't you think it would be as
   well, now and then, to vary the thing and to have a feast day
   occasionally? Would it not be quite as acceptable to God if instead of
   mourning over mercies we want, we were to thank Him for mercies
   enjoyed?" So they instituted what is called the Thanksgiving Day, which
   became a perpetual ordinance afterwards--the thanksgiving for mercies
   received.

   Brethren, there is reason and wisdom in such a course. How dare you go
   and ask for anything else till you have been thankful for what you
   have? What do you do with poor people who depend upon you? You gave the
   man some relief yesterday and he walked away with an ungrateful face,
   shrugging shoulders, as much as to say, "That's all?" Sometimes when
   you have given charity to a very greedy person, have you not seen him
   stand and look at it? What has been your rule when he comes next time?

   You have sent him away empty and very properly is he punished. But how
   is it the Lord does not treat you the same? You ask Him for a mercy and
   you get it. And then you either look at it as though it were not worth
   having, or else you enjoy it for a time, and then forget you have ever
   had it--and never think of thanking Him. And then you knock at His door
   again and expect that He will wait upon your lusts when you will not
   wait upon His Throne with thanksgiving. Oh, let us be thankful for the
   blessings we have, and then we shall attain Divine Grace to win the
   promise we have not.

   There is a young man up there who had a little light yesterday. He had
   been in the darkness before. Thank God for the first gleam, young man,
   and you shall have the full daylight soon. There is a young woman there
   who has been bowed down with a great weight of sin, but her conscience
   is somewhat at peace. She hopes she has a little faith in the Lord. Oh,
   bless God for that little faith, and you shall find it grows. But if
   you will not thank Him, it may be for many a day you shall walk in
   darkness and see no light till you shall come to value God's mercies at
   their proper rate.

   7. And lastly, not to keep you longer, if you would have your faith
   stirred up, look at the examples of all who in olden times and in our
   own time, by faith, have obtained the promise. Sinner, look at the many
   now in Heaven who had no more to trust to than you have--the naked
   promise of God. God says to them as He does to you, "Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." They trusted Christ and they
   are saved. Do you the same and you shall find Him true--

   "I ask them from where their victory came, They with united breath,
   Ascribe their conquests to the Lamb, Their triumph to His death."

   And you saints of God! Look to your noble ancestors. What a pedigree is
   yours! Through what a host of martyrs, confessors, Prophets and
   Apostles has our blood descended! And all these bear their testimony
   that not one good thing has failed of all that the Lord God has
   promised. Among them all there is no exception. Not one of them will
   impugn the veracity of God. They tried Him on the rack, in the gloomy
   dungeon, and at the stake. They tried Him in the Roman amphitheatre,
   when their bones were cracking between the jaws of lions. They tried
   Him in Nero's garden, when the pitch smeared on them was flaming up--an
   awful sacrifice to God.

   They tried Him when then they lay in moldy dungeons rotting, or burning
   with fever. They tried Him in the tracks of the wild goats, when they
   wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, afflicted,
   tormented. They tried Him in the bitterness of life and in the agonies
   of death, and they all say to you--"Trust in the Lord. Believe in Him,
   so shall He bring it to pass and you shall attain the promise.

   Falter not, hesitate not--waver not--but with the unstaggering faith of
   Abraham, say, "He that has promised is able also to perform," and you
   shall see it with your eyes and you shall eat thereof. You shall have
   His Presence and blessing in this world and in the world to come, life
   everlasting. God help us so to do for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                              A Sermon For Spring

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 23, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "My Beloved spoke and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one and
   come way. For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone, the
   flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing of birds is come
   and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land. The fig tree puts
   forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good
   smell. Arise, my love, my fair one and come away." Song of Solomon
   2:10-13.

   THE things which are seen are types of the things which are not seen.
   The works of creation are pictures to the children of God of the secret
   mysteries of Divine Grace. God's Truths are the apples of gold and the
   visible creatures are the baskets of silver. The very seasons of the
   year find their parallel in the little world of man within. We have our
   winter-- dreary howling winter--when the north wind of the Law rushes
   forth against us, when every hope is nipped, when all the seeds of joy
   lie buried beneath the dark clods of despair, when our soul is fast
   fettered like a river bound with ice, without waves ofjoy, or flowings
   of thanksgiving.

   Thanks be unto God, the soft south wind breathes upon our soul and at
   once the waters of desire are set free, the spring of love comes on,
   flowers of hope appear in our hearts, the trees of faith put forth
   their young shoots, the tone of the singing of birds comes in our
   hearts, and we have joy and peace in believing through the Lord Jesus
   Christ. That happy springtide is followed in the Believer by a rich
   summer, when his Graces, like fragrant flowers, are in full bloom,
   loading the air with perfume. And fruits of the Spirit like citrons and
   pomegranates swell into their full proportion in the genial warmth of
   the Sun of Righteousness.

   Then comes the Believer's autumn, when his fruits grow ripe and his
   fields are ready for the harvest. The time has come when his Lord shall
   gather together his "pleasant fruits," and store them in Heaven. The
   feast of ingathering is at hand--the time when the year shall begin
   anew, an unchanging year, like the years of the right hand of the Most
   High in Heaven. Now, Beloved, each particular season has its duty. The
   husbandman finds that there is a time to plow, a time to sow, a time to
   reap. There is a season for vintage and a period for the pruning of the
   vine. There is a month for the planting of herbs and for the
   ingathering of seeds.

   To everything there is a time and a purpose, and every season has its
   special labor. It seems, from the text, that whenever it is springtide
   in our hearts, then Christ's voice may be heard saying, "Arise, My
   love, My fair one and come away." Whenever we have been delivered from
   a dreary winter of temptation or affliction, or tribulation--whenever
   the fair spring of hope comes upon us and our joys begin to multiply,
   then we should hear the Master bidding us seek after something higher
   and better. And we should go forth in His strength to love Him more and
   serve Him more diligently than ever before.

   This I take to be the Truth of God taught in the text, and it shall be
   the subject of this morning's discourse. And to any with whom the time
   of the singing of birds is come, in whom the flowers appear--to any
   such I hope the Master may speak till their souls shall say, "My
   Beloved spoke and said unto me, rise up, My love, My fair one and come
   away." I shall use the general principle in illustration of four or
   five different cases.

   I. First, with regard to THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH OF CHRIST. In looking
   upon her history, with only half an eye, you can plainly perceive that
   she has had her ebbs and flows. Often it seemed as if her tide
   retired--ungodliness, heresy, error prevailed. But she has had her
   flood tide when once again the glorious waves have rolled in, covering
   with their triumphant righteousness the sands of ignorance and evil.
   The history of Christ's Church is a varied year of many seasons. She
   has had her high and noble processions of victory. She has had her
   sorrowful congregations of mourners during times of disaster and
   apparent defeat.

   Commencing with the life of Christ, what a smiling spring it was for
   the world when the Holy Spirit was poured out in Pentecost. Then might
   the saints sing with sweet accord--

   "The Jewish wintry state is gone, The mists are fled, the spring comes
   on. The sacred turtle dove we hear, Proclaim the new, the joyful year.
   The immortal vine of heavenly root, Blossoms and buds and gives her
   fruit; Lo, we are come to taste the wine, Our souls rejoice and bless
   the vine." The winter was over and past--that long season in which the
   Jewish state lay dead, when the frosts of Phariseeism had bound up all
   spiritual life. The rain was over and gone, the black clouds of wrath
   had emptied themselves upon the Savior's head. Thunder and tempest and
   storm--all dark and terrible things--were gone forever.

   The flowers appeared on the earth--three thousand in one day blossomed
   forth, baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Fair promises
   created for beauty and delight sprang up and with their blessed
   fulfillment, clothed the earth in a royal garment of many colors. The
   time of the singing birds was come, for they praised God day and night,
   eating their bread with joy and singleness of heart. The voice of the
   turtle was heard, for the Spirit--that hallowed dove from
   Heaven--descended with tongues of fire upon the Apostles and the Gospel
   was preached in every land.

   Then had earth one of her joyous Sabbaths. The fig tree put forth her
   green figs. In every land there were some converts. The dwellers in
   Mesopotamia, Medes, Parthians, Elamites--some of all--were converted to
   God, and the tender grapes of newborn piety and zeal gave forth a sweet
   smell before God. Then it was that Christ spoke in words which made the
   heart of His Church burn like coals of juniper--My Fellow, My Friend,
   My Beautiful, arise and come your way."

   The bride arose, charmed by the heavenly voice of her Spouse. She girt
   on her beautiful garments and for some hundred years or more, she did
   come away. She came away from her narrowness of spirit and she preached
   to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ--she came away from
   her attachment to the State and she dared to confess that Christ's
   kingdom was not of this world. She came away from her earthly hopes and
   comforts, for, "they counted not their lives dear unto them that they
   might win Christ and be found in Him."

   She came away from all ease and rest of body, for they labored more and
   more abundantly, making herself sacrifices for Christ. Her Apostles
   landed on every shore. Her confessors were found among people of every
   tongue. Her martyrs kindled a light in the midst of lands afflicted
   with the midnight of heathen darkness. No place trod by foot of man was
   left unvisited by the heralds of God, the heroic sons of the Church.
   "Go forth into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature,"
   was ringing in their ears like a clarion sounding the war charge. And
   they obeyed it like soldiers who had been men of war from their youth.

   Those were brave days of old, when with a word, the saints of God could
   overcome a thousand foes--that word the faithful promise of a gracious
   God. Alas, alas, that season passed away! The Church grew dull and
   sleepy. She left her Lord. She turned aside. She leaned upon an arm of
   flesh, courting the endowments of earthly kingdoms. Then there came a
   long and dreary winter, the dark ages of the world, the darker ages of
   the Church. At last the time of love returned, when God again visited
   His people and raised up for them new Apostles, new martyrs, new
   confessors.

   Switzerland, France, Germany, Bohemia, the Low Countries, England, and
   Scotland had all their men of God who spoke with tongues as the Spirit
   gave them utterance. The time of Luther and Calvin and Melancthon and
   of Knox was come--Heaven's sunny days--when once again the frost should
   give way to approaching summer. Then it was that men could say once
   again, "The winter is passed, priest-craft has lost its power, the rain
   is over and gone. False doctrines shall no more be as tempests to the
   Church. The flowers appear on the earth--little Churches--plants of
   God's right hand planting, are springing up everywhere."

   The time of the singing of birds was come. Luther's hymns were sung by
   plowmen in every field. The Psalms translated were scattered among all
   people--carried on the wings of angels, and the Church sang aloud unto
   God, her strength--and entered into His courts with the voice of
   thanksgiving, in such sort as she had not hoped for during her long and
   weary winter's night. In every cottage and under every roof, from the
   peasant's hut, to the prince's palace, the singing of birds was come.
   Then peace came to the people and joy in the Lord, for the voice of the
   turtle was heard delighting hill and valley, grove and field, with the
   love-notes of Gospel Grace.

   Then fruits of righteousness were brought forth, the Church was "an
   orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits," camphire with
   spikenard, spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees
   of frankincense. Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. And a
   sweet savor of faith and love went up to Heaven and God rejoiced
   therein. Then the Master sweetly cried--

   "Rise up, My love, My fair one; come away, Soar on the wings of your
   victorious faith Above the realms of darkness and sin!"

   But she did not hear the voice, or she heard it but partially. Satan
   and his wiles prevailed. The little foxes spoiled the vines and
   devoured the tender grapes. Corruption, like a strong man armed, held
   the spouse and she came not forth at her Beloved's call. In England she
   would not come away--she hugged the arm of flesh. She laid hold upon
   the protection of the State--she would not venture upon the bare
   promise of her Lord. O that she had left dignities, and endowments, and
   laws to worldly corporations--and had rested on her Husband's love
   alone!

   Alas for our divisions at this time! What are they but the bitter
   result of the departure of our fathers from the chastity of simple
   dependence such as Jesus loves? In other lands she confined herself too
   much within her own limits, sent forth few missionaries, labored not
   for the conversion of the outcasts of Israel. She would not come away,
   and so the Reformation never took place. It commenced, but it
   ceased--and the Churches, many of them--remain to this day half
   reformed, in a transition state, somewhere between truth and error.

   As the Lutheran Church and the Established Church of England at the
   present day--too good to be rejected, too evil to be wholly received.
   Having such a savor of godliness that they are Christ's but having such
   a mixture of Popery that their garments are not clean. Oh, would to God
   that the Church could then have heard her Master's voice, "Rise up My
   love, My fair one and come away."

   And now, Brethren, in these days we have had another season of
   refreshing. God has been pleased to pour out His Spirit upon men again.
   Perhaps the late revivals have almost rivaled Pentecost--certainly in
   the number of souls ingath-ered they may bear rigid comparison with
   that feast of first fruits. I suppose that in the north of Ireland, in
   Wales, in America, and in many parts of our own country, there have
   been worked more conversions than took place at the descent of the Holy
   Spirit. The Lord's people are alive, and in earnest, and all our
   agencies are quickened with new energy.

   The time of the singing of birds is come, though there are some harsh,
   croaking ravens still left. The flowers appear on the earth, though
   much unmelted snow still covers the pastures. Thank God, the winter is
   over and passed to a great extent, though there are some pulpits and
   Churches as frost-bound as ever. We thank God that the rain is over and
   gone, though there are still some who laugh at the people of God and
   would destroy all true doctrine. We live in happier days than those
   which have passed. We may speak of these times as the good old times
   wherein time is older than ever it was and, I think, better than it has
   been for many a day.

   And what now? Why, Jesus says, "Rise up My love, My fair one and come
   away." To each denomination of His Church He sends this message, "Come
   away." He seems to speak to Episcopacy and say, "Come away. Cut out of
   the liturgy that which is not according to My mind, leave the State, be
   free." He speaks to the Calvinist and says, "Come away--be no more dead
   and cold as you have been. Let not your sons hold the Truth of God in
   unrighteousness." He speaks to each denomination according to its need,
   but to the same command, "Rise up and come away. Leave deadness, and
   coldness, and wrong-doing, and hardness, and harshness, and bitterness
   of spirit. Leave idleness, and slothfulness and lukewarmness--rise up
   and come away.

   "Come away to preach the Gospel among the heathen. Come away to reform
   the masses of this wicked city. Come away from your little heartedness,
   from your coldness of spirit. Come away--the land is before you--go up
   and possess it." Come away, your Master waits to aid you--strike! He
   will strike with you. Build! He will be the great master Builder--plow!
   He Himself shall break the clods! Arise and thresh the mountains, for
   He shall make you a sharp threshing instrument, having ties, and the
   mountains shall be beaten small until the wind shall scatter them like
   chaff, and you shall rejoice in the Lord. Rise up, people of God, in
   this season of revival and come away! Why do you sleep? Arise and pray,
   lest you enter into temptation.

   II. Methinks the text has a very SPECIAL VOICE TO US AS A CHURCH. We
   must use the Scripture widely but yet personally. While we know its
   reference to the universal Church, we must not forget its special
   application to ourselves. We, too, have had a season of refreshing from
   the presence of the Lord. The day was with this Church in the olden
   times, when we were diminished and brought low through oppression,
   affliction, and sorrow.

   We could not meet more than twenty in a place and sometimes not more
   than five, without fine and persecution. Then the Church had its
   elders, who could meet the few in private houses--and cheer their
   hearts, bidding them abide in patience, waiting till better times might
   come. Then God sent them a pastor after his own heart, Benjamin Rider,
   who fed them with knowledge and understanding, and gathered together
   the scattered sheep during the times of peace.

   Then there followed him a man worthy to be pastor of this Church--one
   who had sat in the stocks at Aylesbury, had seen his books burned by
   the common hangman before his face, and who counted not even his life
   dear unto him that he might win Christ. That man was Benjamin Keach,
   the opener of the parables and expositor of metaphors. On old
   Horselydown, then a great common, a large house was built where he
   preached the Word and his hearers were very many.

   The flowers then appeared on the earth and the time of the singing of
   birds was come to this Church. He passed away and slept with his
   fathers and was followed by Dr. Gill, the laborious commentator. And
   for some time during his sound and solid ministry it was a good and
   profitable season, and the Church was multiplied and built up. But
   again, even under his ministry the ranks were thinned and the host grew
   small. There was doctrine in perfection but more power from on High was
   needed.

   After a space of fifty years or more of Dr. Gill's ministry, God sent
   Dr. Rippon and once more the flowers appeared upon the earth, and the
   Church multiplied exceedingly, bringing forth fruit unto God. And out
   of her there went many preachers who testified of the Truth of God that
   was in Jesus and were the parents of Churches which still flourish.
   Then the good old man, full of years and of good works, was carried to
   his Home--and there came others who taught the Church and ingathered
   many souls--but they were not to the full extent successors of the men
   who went before them, for they tarried but a little season.

   They did much good, but were not such builders as those were who had
   gone before. Then came a time of utter dead-ness. The officers mourned.
   There was strife and division. There became empty pews where once there
   had been full congregations. They looked about them to find one who
   might fill the place and bring together the scattered multitude. But
   they looked, and looked in vain, and despondency and despair fell upon
   some hearts with regard to this Church. But the Lord had mercy on them
   and in a very short space, through His Providence and Grace, the winter
   was passed and the rain was over and gone.

   The time of singing of birds was come again. There were multitudes to
   sing God's praises. The voice of the turtle was heard in our land. All
   was peace and unity and affection and love. Then came the first ripe
   fruits. Many were added to the Church. Then the vines gave forth a
   sweet smell. Converts came, till we have often said, "Who are these
   that fly as a cloud and as doves to their windows?" Often has this
   Church asked the question, "Who has begotten me these?" And now these
   eight years, by God's Grace, we have had a season, not of spasmodic
   revival, but of constant progress.

   We have had a glad period of abundant increase in which there has been
   as many converts as we could receive. Every officer of the Church has
   had his hands full in seeing enquirers, and we have only had time to
   stop, now and then, and take breath and say, "What has God worked?" The
   time came when we erected this house, because no other place was large
   enough for us. And still God continues with us, till our Church
   meetings are not sufficient for the reception of converts. And we know
   not how large a proportion of this assembly are Believers in Christ,
   because time fails to hear the cases of conversion.

   Well, what ought we to do? I hear the Master saying, "Rise up, My love,
   My fair one and come away." I hear Jesus speaking to this Church, and
   saying, "Where much is given, there much shall be required." Serve not
   the Lord as other Churches, but yet more abundantly. As He has given
   you showers of love, so give Him your fertile fields. Let us rejoice
   with thanksgiving. Let this Church feel that she ought to be more
   dedicated to Christ than others. That her members should be more holy,
   loving, living nearer to God. That they should be more devoted, filled
   with more zeal, more fervency, doing more for Christ, praying more for
   sinners, laboring more for the conversion of the world.

   And let us be asking ourselves what can we do, as a Church, that shall
   be more than we have ever thought of doing-- inasmuch as He feeds us
   with the bread of Heaven, multiplies our numbers, keeps us in perfect
   concord, and makes us a happy people? Let us be a peculiar people,
   zealous for good works, showing forth His glory among the sons of men.
   It is a solemn responsibility to rest on any man's mind to be the
   pastor of such a Church as this, numbering very nearly two thousand in
   Church fellowship.

   I suppose such a Baptist Church has never existed before. If we are
   found to be cowards in this day of battle, woe unto us! If we are
   unfaithful to our charge and trust, woe unto us! If we sleep when we
   might do so much, surely will the Master say, "I will take the
   candlestick out of its place and quench their light in darkness.
   Laodicea is neither cold nor hot but lukewarm, I will spew her out of
   my mouth."

   And there shall come a dark day for us, with Ichabod on the forefront
   of our House of Prayer, and darkness in our souls, and bitterness and
   remorse in our spirits, because we served not Christ while we might. I
   will cry aloud to you and spare not to admonish and encourage you, my
   Brethren and comrades, in the conflict for Truth. Men, Brethren and
   fathers. Young men, maidens and mothers in Israel, shall any of us draw
   back now? O Lord, after You have so richly blessed us, shall we be
   ungrateful and become indifferent towards Your good cause and work?

   Who knows but You, O God, have brought us to the kingdom for such a
   time as this? Oh, we beseech You, send down Your holy fire on every
   heart, and the tongue of flame on every head, that everyone of us may
   be missionaries for Christ, earnest teachers of the Truth as it is in
   Jesus!

   I leave these thoughts with you. You can feel them better than I can
   express them. And I can better feel their might than I can make you
   feel it. O God! Teach us what our responsibility is, and give us Divine
   Grace that we may discharge our duty in Your sight.

   III. WHEN THE TIME OF THE BRIDAL OF THE SOUL HAS ARRIVED TO EACH
   CONVICTED SINNER,

   THEN ALSO THERE ARE SPECIAL DUTIES.

   Can you not remember, dearly Beloved, that day of days, that best and
   brightest of hours, when first you saw the Lord, lost your burden,
   received the roll of promise, rejoiced in full salvation, and went on
   your way in peace? My soul can never forget that day. Dying, all but
   dead, diseased, pained, chained, scourged, bound in fetters of iron, in
   darkness and the shadow of death, Jesus appeared unto me.

   My eyes looked to Him. The disease was healed, the pains removed,
   chains were snapped, prison doors were opened, darkness gave place to
   light. What delight filled my soul! What mirth, what ecstasy, what
   sound of music and dancing, what soaring towards Heaven, what height
   and depths of ineffable delight! Scarce since then have we known joys
   which surpassed the rapture of that first hour.

   Oh, do you not remember it, dear Brothers and Sisters? And was it not a
   spring time to you? The winter was passed. It had been so long, so
   dreary--those months of unanswered prayer, those nights of weeping,
   those days of watching. The rain was over and gone. The mutterings of
   Sinai's thunders were hushed. The flashings of its lightning were no
   more perceived. God was beheld as reconciled unto you. The Law
   threatened no vengeance. Justice demanded no punishment.

   Then the flowers appeared in our hearts. Hope, love, peace, patience,
   sprung up from the sod. The snow drop of pure holiness, the crocus of
   golden faith, the daffodil lily of love all decked the garden of the
   soul. The time of the singing birds was come, all that is within us
   magnified the holy name of our forgiving God. Our soul's exclamation
   was--

   "I will praise You every day, Now Your anger's turned away; Comfortable
   thoughts arise, From the bleeding Sacrifice. Jesus is become at length,
   My salvation and my strength; And His praises shall prolong, While I
   live my pleasant song." Every meal seemed now to be a sacrament. Our
   clothes were vestments. The common utensils of our trade were "holiness
   to the Lord." We went out abroad into the world to see everywhere
   tokens for good. We went forth with joy and were led forth with praise.
   The mountains and the hills broke forth before us into singing, and all
   the trees of the fields did clap their hands. It was, indeed, a happy,
   a bright, and a glorious season!

   Do I speak to some who are passing through that spring-tide now? Young
   Convert, young Believer, in the dawn of your piety, Jesus says, "Rise
   up, My love, My fair one and come away." He asks you to come out from
   the world and make a profession of your faith in Him now--do not put it
   off. It is the best time to profess your faith while you are young,
   while as yet to you the days come not, nor the days draw near, when you
   shall say, "I have no pleasure in them."

   Make haste and delay not to keep His commandments. Arise and be
   baptized. Come out from among the world, be separate and touch not the
   unclean thing. Follow Christ in this perverse generation, that you may
   hear Him say at the last, "Of you I am not ashamed, for you were not
   ashamed of Me in the day when I was despised and rejected of men." In
   this, your early time, dedicate yourselves to God. If you do not draw
   up a form and subscribe it with your hand, yet draw it up in your heart
   and subscribe it with your soul--"Lord, I am wholly Yours--all I am and
   all I have, I would devote to You. You have bought me with Your blood.
   Lord, take me into Your service--You have put away all Your wrath and
   given my spirit rest. Let me spend myself and be spent--in life and in
   death let me be consecrated to You."

   Make no reserves. Come altogether away from selfishness--from anything
   which would divide your chaste and pure love to Christ--your soul's
   Husband. Rise up and come away. In this, the beginning of your
   spiritual life, the young dawn of marvelous light, come away from your
   old habits. Avoid the very appearance of evil. Come away from old
   friendships which may tempt you back to the flesh pots of Egypt. Leave
   all these things. Come away to higher flights of spirituality than your
   fathers as yet have known. Come away to private communion. Be much
   alone in prayer.

   Come away--be diligent in the study of God's Word. Come away, shut the
   doors of your chamber and talk with your Lord Jesus and have close and
   intimate dealing with Him. I know I speak to some young babes in Divine
   Grace, beginners in our Israel. Oh, take care that you begin aright by
   coming right away from the world, by being strictly obedient to every
   Divine command, by making your dedication perfect, complete,
   unreserved, sincere, spotless--

   "While from your newly-sprouted vines Whose grapes are young and
   tender, choice and rich, The fa vor comes forth--Belo ved one, rise!
   Rise from this visible engrossing scene, And with affections linked to
   things above, Where Christ, your treasure is, be soaring still!" IV.
   But in the next place our text deserves to be used in another light. It
   may be that you and I have had winters of dark trouble, succeeded by
   soft springs of deliverance.

   We will not enlarge much on our sorrows, but some of us have been to
   the gates of death and, as we thought then, into the very jaws of Hell.
   We have had our Gethesmanes, when our souls have been exceedingly
   sorrowful--nothing could comfort us, we were like the fool who abhorred
   all manner of meat. Nothing came with any consolation to our aching
   hearts. At last the Comforter came to us and all our troubles were
   dissipated. A new season came, the time of the singing of birds was
   once more in our hearts.

   We did not chatter any more like the swallow or the crane, but we began
   to sing as the nightingale, even with the thorn in our breast. We
   learned to mount to Heaven as the lark, singing all the way. The great
   temporal affliction which had crushed us was suddenly removed and the
   strong temptation of Satan was taken off from us. The deep depression
   of spirit which had threatened to drive us to insanity was all of a
   sudden lifted and we became elastic in heart and once again as David,
   danced before the Ark, singing songs of deliverance!

   I address some who this morning are looking back to such seasons. You
   have just reached the realm of sunlight, and you can look back upon
   long leagues of shadow and cloud through which you have had to march.
   The valley of the shadow of death you have just traversed--you can well
   remember the horrible pit and the miry clay. We can still hear the
   rushing as of the wings and feet of crowded miseries. We can still
   remember the terrible shadow of confusion. But we have come through
   it--through it all, by God's Grace--the winter is past, the rain is
   over and gone, and we can rejoice now in Covenant faithfulness and
   renewed loving kindness.

   Now we have our assurance back again. And Christ is near us and we have
   fellowship with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. Well, then,
   what are we to do? Why, the Master says to us, "Rise up and come away."
   Now is the time when we should mount up to be nearer to Him. Now that
   the day dawns, and the shadows flee away, let us seek our Beloved amid
   the beds of spices and by the lilies where He feeds. I would we had
   more in the Church--more in this Church, like Madame Guyon, who loved
   the Lord as that woman did--who had much forgiven. Or like Mrs. Rowe,
   who in England was what Madame Guyon was in France.

   Or like Dr. Hawker, or like Samuel Rutherford, who could pant and long
   and sigh for nearer fellowship with Christ. If there is ever a season
   when we ought to follow hard after the Lord and not be content until we
   have embraced Him, it is when we have come up from the wilderness,
   leaning upon our Beloved. Then should the chaste virgins sing with
   joyous heart concerning Him to whom they are espoused--

   "What is this vain, this visionary scene Of mortal things to me? My
   thoughts aspire Beyond the narrow bounds of rolling spheres. The world
   is crucified and dead to me, And I am dead to all its empty shows. But,
   oh, for YOU unbounded wishes warm My panting soul and call forth all
   her powers. Whatever can raise desire or give delight, Or with full joy
   replenish every wish, Is found in You, You infinite abyss of ecstasy
   and life!" Each Believer should be thirsting for God, for the living
   God--and longing to put his lip to the Wellhead of eternal life--to
   follow the Savior and say, "Oh, that You were as my Brother, that
   sucked the breasts of my mother, when I should find You without, I
   would kiss you, yes, I should not be despised. I would lead You and
   bring You into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause
   You to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. His left
   hand should be under my head and His right hand should embrace me.

   "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor
   awaken my love, until He pleases. Who is this that comes up from the
   wilderness, leaning upon her Beloved? I raised you up under the apple
   tree: there your mother brought you forth. There she brought you forth
   that bore you."

   Oh, that the Believer would never be content with having drops and sips
   of love, but long for the full feast. O my soul thirsts to drink deep
   of that cup which never can be drained and to eat of all the dainties
   of that table which boundless love has furnished. I am persuaded that
   you and I are content to live on pence when we might live on pounds.
   That we eat dry crusts when we might taste the ambrosial meat of
   angels. That we are content to wear rags when we might put on kings'
   robes. That we go out with tears upon our faces when we might anoint
   them with fresh oil.

   I am convinced that many a Believer lives in the cottage of doubt when
   he might live in the mansion of faith. We are poor starving things when
   we might be fed. We are weak when we might be mighty, feeble when we
   might be as the giants before God--and all because we will not hear the
   Master say, "Rise up My love, My fair one and come away."

   Now, Brethren, is the time with you after your season of trouble, to
   renew your dedication vow to God. Now, Beloved, you should rise up from
   worldliness and come away from sloth, from the love of this world, from
   unbelief. What enchants you to make you sit still where you are? What
   delights you to make you as you now are? Come away! There is a higher
   life! There are better things to live for and better ways of seeking
   them. Aspire! Let your high ambition be unsatisfied with what you have
   already learned and know. Not as though you had already attained,
   either were already perfect.

   This one thing do--press forward to the things that are before. Rise,
   Soul, greatly Beloved, and enter into your Master's rest. I cannot get
   my words this morning as I would have them. But if these lips had
   language, I would seek by every motive of gratitude for the mercies you
   are enjoying, by every sensation of thankfulness which your heart can
   experience for Divine Grace received, to make you now say, "Jesus, I
   give myself up to You this day, to be filled with Your love. And I
   renounce all other desires but the desire to be used in Your service,
   that I may glorify You."

   Then, methinks there may go out of this place this morning many young
   men, and old men, too. Many youths and maidens, determined to be doing
   something for Christ. I well remember preaching a sermon one Sunday
   morning which stirred up some Brethren to the midnight meeting movement
   and much good was done, by God's Grace. What if some new thought should
   pass through some newly quickened spirit and you should think of some
   fresh invention for glorifying Christ at this good hour? Is there no
   Mary here who has an alabaster box at home unbroken? Will she not today
   break it over the Master's head?

   Is there no Zaccheus here who will today receive Christ into his house,
   constrained by Divine love? Oh, by the darkness that has gone, and by
   the brightness that has come, live lovingly towards Christ! Oh, by the
   fears that have been hushed, by the pains that have been removed, by
   the joy you now experience, and by the delights which He has promised
   you, I beseech you, cling to Him and seek to serve Him! Go into the
   world to bring in His lost sheep, to look after His hidden ones, to
   restore to Him that lost piece of money for which He has lit the candle
   and desires you to sweep the house.

   O Christian Brothers and Sisters, it is an angel's work I have
   attempted now, and mortal lips fail. But I beg you, if there is any
   heart of mercy, if there is any consolation in Christ Jesus, "if you
   then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where
   Christ sits at the right hand of God." Lay not up your treasure upon
   earth where thieves break through and steal. But lay up your treasure
   in Heaven--for where your treasure is, there shall your heart be also.

   If you love my Master, serve Him--if you do not, if you owe Him
   nothing, oh, if you owe Him nothing and have had no favor from
   Him--then I beg you to seek mercy. But if you have found it. If you
   know it--oh, for His love's sake love Him! This dying world needs Your
   help, my Lord! This wicked sinful world needs Your aid. Up and be
   doing! The battle is raging furiously. Multitudes, multitudes in the
   valley of decision! Guards up, and at them! Do you sleep, Sirs? Sleep
   when now the shots are flying thick as hail and the foemen are rallying
   for the last charge in the world's mighty Armageddon?

   Up! For the defiant standard of Hell waves proudly in the breeze. Do
   you say you are feeble? He is your strength. Do you say you are few? It
   is not by many nor by few that God works. Do you say, "I am obscure?"
   God wants not the notoriety and fame of men. Up, men, women, and
   children in Christ! Up! Be no more at ease in Zion, but serve God while
   it is called today, for the war needs every hand, and the conflict
   calls for every heart. And night comes, when no man can fight or work.

   V. And now, last of all, the time is coming to us all when we shall die
   upon our beds. Oh, long-expected day, hasten and come! The best thing a
   Christian can do is to die and be with Christ which is far better.

   Well, when we shall lie upon our deathbeds, panting out our life, we
   shall remember that then the winter is past forever. No more of this
   world's trials and troubles. "The rain is over and gone." No more
   stormy doubts, no more dark days of affliction. "The flowers appear on
   the earth." Christ is giving to the dying saints some of the foretastes
   of Heaven. The angels are throwing over the walls some of the flowers
   of Paradise. We have come to the land Beulah. We sit down in beds of
   spices and can almost see the Celestial City on the hilltops, on the
   other side of the narrow stream of death.

   "The time of the singing of the birds is come." Angelic songs are heard
   in the sick chamber. The heart sings, too, and midnight melodies cheer
   the quiet entrance of the grave. "Though I walk through the valley of
   the shadow of death I will fear no evil, for You are with me." Those
   are sweet birds which sing in the groves by the side of the river
   Jordan. Now it is that "the voice of the turtle is heard in our land."
   Calm, peaceful and quiet, the soul rests in the consciousness that
   there is no condemnation to him that is in Christ Jesus. Now does "the
   fig tree put forth her green figs."

   The first fruits of Heaven are plucked and eaten while we are on earth.
   Now do the very vines of Heaven give forth a smell that can be
   perceived by love. Look forward to your death, you that are Believers
   in Christ, with great joy! Expect it as your spring tide of life, the
   time when your real summer shall come and your winter shall be over
   forever--

   "One distant glimpse my eager passion fires! Jesus! To You my longing
   soul aspires! When shall I hear Your voice divinely say, Rise up My
   love, My fair one come away? Come meet your Savior bright and glorious
   Over sin and death and Hell victorious." May God grant that the people
   who fear His name may be stirred up this morning, if not by my words,
   yet by the Words of my text and by the influences of God's Spirit. And
   may you who have never had sweet seasons from the presence of God, seek
   Christ and He will be found of you. And by His Grace, may we all meet
   in the land where winters of sin and sorrow shall be all unknown. Amen.

                                A Sight Of Self

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 2, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But we are alias an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as
   filthy rags. And we all do fade as a leaf. And our iniquities, like the
   wind, have taken us away. And there is none that calls upon Your name,
   that stirs up himself to take hold of You: for You have hid Your face
   from us and have consumed us, because of our iniquities. But now, O
   Lord, You are our Father. We are the clay, and You our Potter. And we
   all are the work of Your hand."

   Isaiah 64:6, 7,8.

   IT is easy to commit sin but hard to confess it. Man will transgress
   without a tempter. But even when urged by the most earnest pleader, he
   will not acknowledge his guilt. If we could but bring men into such a
   state of heart that they felt themselves to be guilty, there would be
   hope for them. But this is one of the most hopeless signs concerning
   our race, that it is so hardened and so perverse, that even when sin
   stares it in the face, it still pleads innocence and proudly lifts up
   its head and challenges the accuser.

   Transgressors always seek to escape from the painful and humiliating
   duty of acknowledging their offenses. Some seek to hide it both from
   themselves and others, silencing their own consciences and throwing
   dust in the eyes of their companions. As Achan, digging in the earth to
   hide the Babylonian garment and the wedge of gold, they forget that
   their sins will surely find them out. As the foolish ostrich, when
   pursued by the hunters, buries its head in the sand and when it cannot
   see its enemy thinks it has escaped--so these men take the fact that
   they are undiscovered by men, and are at peace with themselves, as a
   good omen. In reality, it is a sad sign of hardness and blindness of
   heart.

   Many pursue yet another course and make excuses for their offenses.
   They did do wrong, it is true, but then there is much to be said in
   extenuation. Like Aaron, they urge the clamors of the people, or they
   will have it that even Providence, itself, compelled them to sin. "I
   cast gold into the fire and there came out this calf," as if sin were
   an accident, and not a willful wickedness. As if disobedience to God
   were a sort of necessity of nature, and not a direct rebellion of the
   will against the Majesty of Heaven.

   Others, too, will blame their sin on their fellows--a trick which they
   learned from our first parents, for Adam, in the garden, said--"The
   woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did
   eat." Or they may have learned it from our mother, Eve, for even she
   understood this stratagem--"The serpent beguiled me and I did eat." So
   they will have it that they were dragged into sin by force--they were
   overly persuaded or craftily enticed, so that they ought not to be
   considered as accomplices in the crime--but that they are, in fact,
   only the instruments of others' sins and could hardly resist. So they
   say others must take the whole of the guilt and they themselves should
   go free.

   Some who have attained to a higher pitch of brazen impudence will
   actually deny altogether that they have sinned. They will come before
   God's servant as Ananias did before Peter, and say, "Yes, for so much,"
   while yet they are holding a lie in their right hand. We have some who
   will stoutly say, "We have not sinned," and who think themselves
   insulted if in plain terms you accuse them of having violated the Law
   of God. There are some, also, and those not a few, who endeavor to
   color their sins and to cloak them with a profession of godliness, by
   attending to the ceremonies of religion with ostentatious carefulness.

   Like the Pharisees of old, they devour widows' houses but they make
   long prayers. They hate Christ in their hearts but they tithe mint and
   anise and cummin. They violate the precepts of the Law, but they bind
   them on their foreheads, wear long fringes on their garments, and write
   texts of Scripture on the doorposts of their houses. These serve at the
   altar of the devil, in the garb of God's priests and offer unclean
   flesh upon the high places, in pretended honor of the God of Israel. We
   know that all these classes abound everywhere, for a man will do
   anything to hide sin from himself.

   And he will give skin for skin, yes, all that he has, that he may be
   self-justified. He will do his all so that, he thinks, he may have
   something to answer when he stands before the Most High. So that he may
   find food for his pride and a coverlet for the infamous arrogance of
   his heart, he will dig and labor and strive. He will give his goods to
   the poor and his body to be burned, that he may win a righteousness of
   his own.

   Beloved, if you and I have ever been partakers of the Grace of God, we
   have been brought to the distasteful duty of confession of sin, for it
   is not possible that we have been pardoned if we have refused to
   acknowledge our guilt. We cannot be partakers of the life of God in the
   soul if still we can say, "Lord, I am righteous and of myself I can
   plead exemption from Your curse." A clear sense of our lost estate is
   absolutely necessary to make us even seek pardon.

   As the man who thinks himself in good health will never send for a
   physician, as the man who is sufficiently warm will not avail himself
   of an extra garment which is offered to him, as the man who is not
   hungry will not accept an invitation to a feast of charity--so we find
   that none will come to Christ but those who feel that they must
   come--and that outside of Him they are utterly lost, ruined and undone.
   Moreover, as none will seek the mercy till they know their need, so we
   may rest assured that none would value that mercy even if it were given
   to them before the spiritual poverty had become manifest.

   What is medicine to the healthy man? Send it to his door and what
   thanks will you receive? You have been guilty of an impertinence. Why
   offer charity to the man who is rich and increased in goods? Will he
   receive your dole? Will he not turn up his nose and tell you to look
   for the beggar in the street, but not to mistake him for one who needs
   your alms? Even, I say, should God give salvation to those who feel no
   need of it, they would not value the priceless benefit. This diamond of
   God would be to them but a piece of valueless broken glass. This gem
   from Heaven but as a pebble from the brook--

   "What comfort can a Savior bring To those who never felt their woe? A
   sinner is a sacred thing, The Holy Spirit has made him so." It is
   certain that God will never give pardon to those who do not confess
   their need of it, for it is not consistent with the sovereignty and
   dignity of God that He should present pardon to the man who will not
   first honor God's Law by pleading that he is guilty. If a man shall
   still say, "I have not broken the Law," is God unmerciful if He refuse
   to forgive him? Will you harden your brow like iron, and your heart as
   adamant--and will you accuse God of want of love, if He says, "I will
   send no mercy to that man, neither shall he find pardon at My hands,
   but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite
   spirit and trembles at My Word"?

   Is it any wonder, I ask you, that He should pass by the proud and the
   self-righteous and leave them unblest? By their own profession they do
   not want His mercy. They declare they do not need to be forgiven. Then
   perish! Perish, for you righteously deserve it. Go down to the Hell
   which you have chosen by your pride, and reap the fruits of your own
   willfulness--but impugn not the tenderness of God, if He adhere to this
   inviolable rule, that if we will not confess our sins we shall perish
   in our guilt--

   "For Christ as soon would abdicate His own,
   As stoop from Heaven to sell the proud a throne."

   This morning it is my intention, as God shall help me, to describe that
   view which every gracious soul is sure to have of himself. Then,
   secondly, to warn you of certain dangers to which those are enclosed
   who only know their need but who have not yet found Christ. And I hope
   to close with the pleas--some of which are in the text, some to be
   found elsewhere-- which every soul that is conscious of guilt may urge
   before the Throne of Mercy.

   I. First, then, I HAVE TO DESCRIBE THE VIEW WHICH EVERY TRULY GRACIOUS
   SOUL WILL TAKE OF HIMSELF. And as I describe it, I hope there are some
   here who will say, "That is what I think of myself, that is my
   condition before God." Though you should think yours to be a hopeless
   case, yet I pray you rest assured that it is not so if you can join in
   the confession through which I am now about briefly to pass. I feel
   persuaded that it is the Spirit of God which has brought you to a deep
   sense of your lost estate and has thus begun a good work in your soul.

   1. Every gracious soul, who is truly enlightened by the Spirit, has a
   clear sense of the root of all his guiltiness. He knows the plague of
   his own heart and cries with the text, "We are all as an unclean
   thing." He discovers that not merely his outward acts, but that his
   very person is essentially sinful in the sight of God. He was willing
   to confess once that the streams were black, but now he perceives to
   his horror that the fountain itself is defiled. You could have made him
   previously confess that the fruits of his boughs were bitter. But now
   he perceives that the root is corrupt, the tree is evil, the very sap
   is poisonous.

   He is brought to feel now that sinfulness lies in the very marrow of
   his bones and is inherent in his blood. That he himself--as well as his
   thoughts and his acts--he himself, is "as an unclean thing." The
   metaphor that is here used is hardly understood by us, because it is
   drawn from the Levitical and ceremonial use of the word "unclean."
   Under the Jewish Law when a person was unclean he could not go up to
   the house of the Lord. He could offer no sacrifice.

   God could accept nothing at his hands. He was an outcast and an alien
   so long as he remained unclean. If he sat upon a bed, it must be washed
   with water. If he touched a vessel of earth it must be broken, for it
   was unclean. If he ate any food, the whole of that food was unclean and
   no clean person might venture to touch it. When this uncleanness was
   connected with disease, as in the case of leprosy, the man became
   loathsome--so utterly loathsome to himself that it must have been a
   horror to have lived. And so loathsome to his fellow creatures that his
   only appropriate spot was solitude, where alone, far from any water
   brook of which human lips might drink, alone so that the air might not
   be contaminated with his disease, alone, he lived and cried, "Unclean!
   Unclean! Unclean!"

   Every gracious soul knows itself to be by nature as an unclean thing.
   He feels that of himself he cannot worship God acceptably. That he
   cannot stand within the veil on his own merits. That he can bring no
   sacrifice which God can accept. That he is the means of injury to
   others. That his ill example leads others astray. And that, in fact, he
   is not fit to stand in the congregation of the righteous, nor to be
   numbered with God's chosen, for he is, in himself, polluted and
   polluting.

   When a sense of his horrible depravity and degradation is heavy upon
   him, before he has found Christ, that man will slink into the House of
   God like a felon and hide. Or, if he sits down with God's people, it is
   with the idea that he is out of place like a filthy beggar in a palace,
   or a loathsome reptile in a hallowed temple. Often he feels, when a
   Christian speaks to him, as if he were not fit to give an answer. He
   feels himself to be in person, utterly unfit to live.

   Ah, well do I remember the period when first I discovered this Truth of
   God. And how did I wish, as John Bunyan did, that I had been anything
   but a man--a toad, or a serpent--sooner than have been a man, a
   creature that had offended its own Maker. A creature in itself so prone
   to go astray, so sure to sin if left alone. In "Grace Abounding,"
   Bunyan says, "My original and inward pollution, that, that was my
   plague and affliction. That, I say, at a dreadful rate, always putting
   forth itself within me. That I had the guilt of, to amazement, by
   reason of that, I was more loathsome in my own eyes than was a toad."

   And I thought I was so in God's eyes, too. "Sin and corruption," I
   said, "would as naturally bubble out of my heart, as water would bubble
   out of a fountain. I thought that everyone had a better heart than I
   had. I could have changed hearts with anybody. I thought none but the
   devil, himself, could equal me for inward wickedness and pollution of
   mind. I fell, therefore, at the sight of my own vileness, deeply into
   despair. For I concluded that this condition that I was in could not
   stand with a state of Grace."

   Oh, there was no talk of human dignity then! There are still some few
   of your fine preachers who will have it that there is a deal of dignity
   in human nature--that man is a noble creature. Alas, Brethren, he that
   talks about the dignity of nature, and the nobility of fallen man, does
   not know himself. So far from being fit for the pulpit, he ought to
   begin to learn his catechism. He cannot speak of a state of Grace, for
   he has not yet learned aright his own state by nature! He must be a
   blind leader of the blind who can talk like this. He does not know the
   first work of the Spirit in his own soul, or else he would feel that we
   are just the reverse of anything that is noble or good, for "we are all
   as an unclean thing."

   The whole man is vile and desperately evil, there is not one sound spot
   left within or without. The sin is white on our very forehead, but its
   core lies deep within. The heart is deceitful. The passions are
   corrupt. The understanding is eaten through and through with a deadly
   leprosy. And in us, that is, in our own flesh, there dwells no good
   thing--

   "Lord, when Your Spirit deigns to show
   The badness of our hearts,
   Astonished at the amazing view,
   The soul with horror starts.
   The dungeon opening, foul as Hell,
   Its loathsome stench emits;
   And, brooding in each secret cell,
   Some hideous monster sits. Swarms of ill thoughts their bane diffuse,
   Proud, envious, false, unclean; And every ransacked corner shows Some
   unsuspected sin."

   2. But in the second place, the spiritually enlightened man--and we
   insist upon it that none else are spiritually enlightened--the
   spiritually enlightened man, then, perceives that all his actions are
   evil. "All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Our
   righteousnesses. It does not say our unrighteousnesses. Brethren, if
   our righteousnesses are so bad, what must our unrighteousnesses be? Our
   "righteousnesses," that is, our prayers, our tears, our good
   deeds--those things whereof we once gloried--when we are really taught
   of God, we perceive that these are filthy rags.

   The expression, "filthy rags," in the Hebrew, is one which we could not
   with propriety explain in the present assembly. As the confession must
   be made privately, and alone before God, so the full meaning of the
   comparison is not meant for human ears. Suffice it to say that rags
   which have bound up a foul, putrid, running sore, are understood by
   some commentators and our righteousnesses are comparable to such rags
   as these. Oh tell me not that we exaggerate when we describe the Fall
   of man! O Sirs! Say not that we love to depreciate our race and that we
   slander that noble creature, man.

   All those things which you call exaggerations fall below the mark--even
   below the mark of what some of us have felt concerning ourselves--and
   that is very far from what God knows of our state. Sirs, there is sin
   in our prayers. They need to be prayed over again. There is filth in
   the very tears that we shed in penitence. There is sin in our very
   holiness! There is unbelief in our faith. There is hatred in our very
   love. There is the slime of the serpent upon the fairest flower of our
   garden.

   I know time was, in looking back upon my past life--and it had been
   moral and without exception to the eyes of others--yet I loathed myself
   that ever I should have lived such an unworthy life. And indeed at the
   present I can do but little otherwise, for "in me (that is in my flesh)
   dwells no good thing." I am sure when the soul is convicted of sin it
   will look upon self-righteousness as the most detestable lie that ever
   was forged by Hell. And it will regard all self-confidence as the most
   frightful delusion and deception into which the soul can fall.

   Trust in our doings, Brethren?--we have no doings to trust! If our best
   works are bad, and so bad that they are as filthy rags, what must our
   bad works be? Oh, I would have some of you remember your bad works this
   morning that you may repent of them. You remember how the Apostle
   speaks of "fornicators, adulterers, thieves, covetous, drunkards," and
   he says, "such were some of you. But you are washed, but you are
   sanctified"? There is no wisdom in daintily handling men's sins. There
   are vices in London as much as in Corinth, and we have in our Churches
   those who once indulged in them.

   And in this congregation this morning we may have some who live in them
   still. O God, show them their sin. Let them feel their guilt before
   You. And let us all, as we shall do, if Your spirit is in our hearts,
   confess that all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.

   3. In the next place, the enlightened heart into which the candle of
   the Lord has shone, is led to see the failure and futility of all its
   resolutions to be better. "We all do fade as a leaf." Some of you have
   been lately awakened, you have felt yourselves to be lost souls. And
   what have you been doing? Why, you have promised to be better and you
   have tried to be. You have mended in various ways, or, rather, you have
   proposed to yourselves to amend.

   Perhaps you made up your mind that you would never go out to your labor
   again without prayer--that you would never lose your temper--that when
   tempted to indulge your passions you would restrain them--that those
   things which had been your besetting sins should now be given up. What
   progress have you made with your resolutions? Are you not today like
   the man who resolved and re-resolved but remained the same? Truly in
   our own strength, we all do fade as a leaf. We look fair and green in
   the morning when we rise from our beds, fresh with midnight vows and
   repenting--but before night we are as faded and withered as the dry
   sere leaf withered with autumn blasts.

   We went forth, saying, "Today I shall stand--this time I shall not
   fall--now I am safe--I have made up my mind-- I am resolved--I know
   there is a something in me which can improve, I can be better if I
   like--I will reform--I will stand up and make myself a Christian." But
   what became of it all? Down it went and, "like the baseless fabric of a
   vision, left not a wreck behind." You returned like a dog to his vomit,
   or the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. How many slips
   men make before they learn to put themselves into God's arms to be
   carried by Him!

   It seems as if we must try fifty times before we will learn that simple
   Truth of God--"Without Me you can do nothing." We run about over the
   treacherous beach looking for a spot of sand just a little harder than
   the last. And we compliment ourselves that we have hit upon a much more
   solid site for our new and noble house. "Ah, that was a mistake last
   time--that was a poor bit of sand to build on--this time it is all
   right. See how hard it is! The tide does not come here often--see it
   does not yield, it is like a bowling green, smooth and hard. I will
   build here."

   The timbers are laid, the goodly stones are squared and the house
   rises. But, hark! What is that? The breakers are coming up. The tide
   certainly does reach this very spot. It is a full spring tide that is
   now marching up the shore and lo, the materials are engulfed in the
   all-devouring deep. Our tower has tottered and great is its fall. What
   will disappointed man do now, Sirs? Why, he will look for another bit
   of sand, and so he will go on unless the Grace of God prevents him. But
   when Divine Grace comes he will give up all the sand at once, and begin
   to build upon the Rock and upon the Rock, alone.

   I would have you reform as much as you can. But do not mix your
   reformation with religion, for you need regeneration--reformation will
   not suffice. No touching up of the old house will suffice! Down with
   it, down with it, for the very foundation is rotten! It is not mending
   your clothes. It is throwing them away and wearing the new robes of
   righteousness that will fit you for the feasts of Glory. We want no
   Gibeon "old shoes and clouted." You must have shoes of iron and
   brass--for those are the only ones that can carry you to Heaven.

   You may use your brush and your niter and your soap. But if you would
   enter Heaven you must go to God and ask Him to make the Ethiopian anew,
   for none of these things can make him white before God. "All our
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags--we all do fade as a leaf." Our best
   professions, hopes, resolutions and pretensions--all of them fade like
   shadows, dreams and fancies of the brain.

   4. But the truly awakened soul knows a fourth thing, namely, that he is
   not in himself able to stand against the invasions of temptation, for
   the text has put it--"Our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us
   sway." There is a dry leaf hanging alone on that tree. All its
   companions have long ago fallen and are gone. Sere-leaf, you will not
   long hold your place, for you depend for your connection with the tree
   upon a very slender thread.

   Listen! The north wind howls. Now shall all the trees be clear. Where
   is the withered leaf now? Hurried away to join the rotting heap upon
   the ground. So, when men find that their vows wither, they will still
   hang to their hopes and to their moralities. But some strong temptation
   comes unexpectedly upon them just at the moment when their mind is
   susceptible of its power and where are they? The devil catches their
   tinder dry and then strikes the spark. He knows how to time his
   temptations. He does not assail his victims when they are ready to
   resist him, but waylays them in the dark corner of some cutthroat lane
   and smites the unguarded passenger with a deadly blow.

   The thief never lets you know when he intends to break in, for, "if the
   good man of the house had known in what hour the thief would come, he
   would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken
   into." The temptation comes like a howling north wind at an unexpected
   moment, and where is your man now? Unable to resist, carried away by
   the very vice which he thought he had renounced. "Our iniquities, like
   the wind, have taken us away."

   Every Christian here knows that the Grace of God is stronger than all
   the winds of temptation. And he knows, also, that apart from that, he
   can no more resist sin than the chaff from the hand of the winnower can
   stand against the blast of a hurricane. He feels that if he is put into
   the furnace he can abide the fire through Divine Grace but that apart
   from Grace he is as thread before the flame or like wax before the
   fire. The well-instructed Believer is very much afraid of himself. He
   dares not go into temptation, for he feels that a man who carries a
   bomb within him ought to mind that he keeps away from the sparks--and
   that he who has a powder keg in his heart ought not to play with fire.

   He knows that in himself, apart from the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,
   he would as certainly go back to his old sins, and fall again into his
   past lusts, as do those who crucify the Lord afresh, and put Him to an
   open shame. Ah, my Hearer, if you do not know this, I am afraid you do
   not know yourself. And if you do not know yourself, you do not know
   Christ. We must traverse the stripping room before we can enter into
   the robbing room. Pull that bracelet from the man's wrist! Off with
   that crown! Strip him of the purple robe! Away with those sandals! Tear
   up that cloak. Leave him naked.

   He is never fit to be clothed till he is naked. Let his foul skin be
   seen, for he cannot be washed till he can see his filth. Now set his
   feet upon the Rock, but first of all, pull his feet from the sand, for
   as long as they have any foothold anywhere else, they cannot stand upon
   the Rock of Ages safely and securely. I hope that very many of you do
   know that your iniquities, like the wind, will carry you away--unless
   you have the Grace of God.

   5. Those souls upon whom God's sunlight has once shone are also
   painfully aware of their own natural weakness and slothfulness in
   prayer. What does the text say? "There is none that calls upon Your
   name, that stirs up himself to take hold of You." In my carnal state I
   used to hear a minister whose preaching was, as far as I could make
   out, "Do this and do that, and do the other, and you will be saved."
   According to his theory, to pray was a very easy thing. To make
   yourself a new heart was a thing of a few instants and could be done at
   almost any time. I was really convinced that I could turn to Christ
   when I pleased, and therefore I could put it off to the last part of my
   life when it might be conveniently done upon a sick bed.

   But when the Lord gave my soul its first shakings in conviction, I soon
   knew better. I went to pray. I did pray, God knows, but it seemed to me
   that I did not. What, I approach the Throne? Such a wretch as I lay
   hold on the promise? I venture to hope that God could look on me? It
   seemed impossible. A tear, a groan, and sometimes not so much as that,
   and that was all. An "Ah," a "Would that," a "But"--the lips could not
   utter more. It was prayer, but it did not seem so, then. Oh, how hard
   is prevailing prayer to a poor God-provoking sinner! Where was the
   power to lay hold on God's strength or wrestle with the angel?
   Certainly not in me, for I was weak as water and sometimes hard as the
   nether millstone.

   Every Believer feels at times a fearful inability in prayer. He goes to
   the Throne of Grace, and groans, and comes forth from his closet no
   more refreshed than a man who rises from his bed after having tossed to
   and fro all night. He knows what it is to pray, but he cannot perform
   the duty. He knows there is a power in prayer, but he cannot get the
   power. The chariot wheels are knocked off and he drags heavily along
   where once his soul was like the chariot of Abi-nadab.

   Well, I think we do not know ourselves unless we have been led to see
   that God must draw near to us, or else we cannot draw near to Him--and
   unless we have been led to loathe ourselves, because of this
   indifference in prayer--we have not yet discovered what we are. Oh, to
   think that we cannot pray! This is not an inability for which we
   deserve to be comforted but a damnable inability. This is one of the
   greatest sins we have, that we cannot approach our Maker. It is an
   awful and terrific thing that we should have become so wicked, and so
   vile, that we cannot even ask for mercy and cry for it aright. This is
   no excuse but an aggravation of our guilt. Have you felt this, my
   Hearer? Oh, if you have not, I fear you have to begin again and learn
   the first elements of faith.

   6. Lastly on this point, that soul which has once perceived itself in
   the black colors of its iniquity has discovered that through sin it has
   lost all the favor and the love of God which might have come if it had
   been without sin. For so says the text, "For You have hid Your face
   from us and have consumed us because of our iniquities." It is no thing
   to play with-- that hiding of God's face.

   When the Prophet says, "You have consumed us," it is a dreadful word.
   Do you see that burning fiery furnace? The soldiers of Nebuchadnezzar
   are about to cast three bound men into it, that they may be consumed.
   The fire is exceedingly hot, so that it may consume them quickly. To
   the apprehension of an awakened sinner that is his fate. He feels that
   he must be cast into Hell and be utterly consumed. No, more, with some,
   though not with all to the same degree, the man is consumed.

   Some of us feel as if our locks were crisp even now with that awful
   burning through which we passed when we were first convicted of sin.
   Bunyan seems to have enjoyed the full light of God's countenance all
   the more because of his distinct recollection of the solemn period of
   conviction through which he passed. If you read Hart's hymns, you will
   be struck with their singular clearness concerning Christ and full
   justification.

   That certainty and assurance results very much from the fact that Hart
   retained to his dying day, the remembrance of his experience when he
   was under the whip of the Law. You will remember that when he is trying
   to describe his own feelings, he fails to do so and he adds--

   "Oh, what a dismal state was this! What horrors shook my feeble frame.
   But, Brethren, surely you can guess,
   For you, perhaps, have felt the same." Now, I do not think that all who
   know the Lord suffer this consumption to the same extent. But there
   must be in your heart--if you are saved at all--there must be heard a
   voice putting down every hope but Christ's, casting down every thought
   but that which looks to Him.
   You must have seen the death warrant condemning your excuses, your
   false trusts, your proud boastings, and glorying, to an ignominious
   execution or surely you know not the Lord. And if you have not thus
   known and felt that God is angry with the wicked every day, and that
   you in yourself are the object of His wrath, I fear you have not yet
   been quickened of the Spirit. But I know there are many such
   here--multitudes who have passed through this and who take this view of
   themselves today and others who are now suffering under it. May the
   Lord bring us all to Christ and to His finished work!
   II. I come now to the second part of my subject, which I shall dismiss
   with two or three words only. My dear Friends, as I have been speaking
   I have seen you lean forward to catch every word, for you have said,
   "Ah, that is me," and "He speaks of me," and "That is me. He reads my
   heart in the description."

   Well, now, there is a danger I must warn you of and that is--DO NOT BE
   CONTENT WITH THE MERE

   KNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS SO. You must not merely know that you are lost but
   you must feel it. Do not be content with simply feeling that it is so,
   but mourn before God that it is so, and hate yourself that it is so. Do
   not look upon it as being a misfortune, but as being your own willful
   sin. Look upon yourselves, therefore, as being guilty sinners,
   condemned already, not only for all this but condemned because you
   believe not on Christ, for that, after all, is the crowning
   condemnation.

   And when you really feel your sinfulness and mourn it, do not stop
   there. Never give yourself any rest till you know that you are
   delivered from it, for it is one thing to say--"Ah, I do sin," but it
   is quite another thing to say--"He has saved me from my sin." It is one
   thing to have a repentance which makes you leave the sin you loved
   before, and another thing to talk about repentance. Ah, I have
   sometimes seen a child of God when he has sinned, and I have seen his
   brokenhearted actions, and heard his piteous confessions, and I can say
   that my heart goes out toward the man in whom there are tears of
   repentance of the right kind.

   It is one of the fairest sights that is seen under Heaven when a
   Believer who has gone wrong is willing to say, "I have sinned," and
   when he no more sets himself proudly up against his God but humbles
   himself like a little child. Such a man as that shall be exalted. But I
   have seen, and it is a fearful sight to see--I have seen one who can
   sin and repent and sin and repent. Oh, that dry-eyed repentance is a
   damnable repentance! Take heed of it, Brothers and Sisters.

   I have known a man who professed to have been converted years and years
   ago, who, ever since that pretended conversion, has lived in a known
   sin, and yet he thinks he is a child of God because after he has fallen
   into the sin he has a little season of darkness arising from his
   conscience. But he quiets that conscience after a time and
   presumptuously says, "I will not give up my hope." Oh, that is an awful
   thing! God deliver you from dry-eyed repentance, for it is not
   repentance! God save you from that!

   I pray you, my dear Hearers, while I describe these things, do not be
   saying, "There is my comfort, because I feel it." That is not comfort!
   There is no ground for comfort there. It would be just as if when the
   doctor walked through the hospital and stopped before a bed and said,
   "A man who has a fever, or a man who has a cancer, feels so and so, and
   so and so." And the patient should say, "Why that is just what I feel."
   Is there any comfort in that? The only comfort is that he knows he has
   a fever.

   "A man that has the typhus and must die unless a miracle is worked,
   feels so and so." "That is how I feel." Is there any comfort in that?
   No, only the comfort to know that you will die. There is no comfort to
   be had from a sense of our depravity. The comfort is to be had in
   getting that which is to cure the depravity. The comfort is not to be
   found in the disease. We are not to go raking the stinking puddle of
   our own lusts to find sweet waters.

   What? Scrape the foul dunghill of our own corruptions to find something
   that is to give us hope? God forbid! It is in the remedy, not in the
   disease. It is in Christ and not in our sense or guilt that we are to
   find peace. I pray you, my dear Hearers, never be satisfied till you
   find Christ who saves His people from their sins--

   "O!Beware of fondly thinking God accepts you for your tears.
   Are the shipwrecked saved by sinking? Can the ruined rise by fears?"

   III. And now, lastly, though our second head deserves a sermon, THE
   TEXT SEEMS TO SUGGEST SOME PLEAS. We will use them very briefly but
   passionately.

   Poor troubled Soul, have you been able to go with me in the confession,
   and can you say, "Lord, I would be made whole. I would be saved from
   all my sins. I desire to be made holy and to be accepted in Christ"?
   Then there are many pleas you can use. I am afraid you can not use the
   first one mentioned in the text--"You are my Father"! I am half afraid
   you have not faith enough for that, but oh, if you have, what a
   prevailing plea it is!

   "My Father, I have sinned but I am Your son, though not worthy to be so
   called. My Father, by a father's love forgive, forgive Your erring one.
   By the heart of Your compassion have mercy upon me!" You who have
   backslidden can plead this, for you know your adoption. You feel the
   "Abba Father" on your lips now. Plead it. Would you, being evil, refuse
   to forgive your child? Would you not take him up in your arms and say,
   "My child, I cannot bear to see you weep. Your tears make my heart
   bleed"? Would you not give him a kiss and say, "Go and sin no more"?

   But if that should be too hard for you, take the next plea. Say, "Lord,
   I am the clay and You the Potter. I am helpless like the clay which
   cannot fashion itself, I am worthless, Lord, like the clay that is of
   no value. I am filthy, Lord, like clay. I am only worthy to be trod
   under foot, but You are the Potter and potters can make fine things
   even of clay, vessels of honor out of dishonorable earth. Here I am,
   Lord. I put myself into Your hand. I am nothing. Make me what You would
   have me to be. Come, Lord, and make me, mold me, and fashion me.

   "I confess I have no power. I acknowledge that I have no merit. O God,
   have mercy upon me! I will be the clay, You be the potter! Make me to
   be Your workmanship, created anew in Christ Jesus unto good works."
   Will not that plea suffice? Soul, use it and try its prevalence!

   But listen, Sinner. There is a sweeter plea than any in the verse
   before us, for this is an Old Testament text. But I must take you to
   the New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for the plea that
   never fails. It is this, "Lord, it is written that Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners. If there was never a sinner in the
   world but one, I am that sinner. If you write it in capital letters I
   will wear it on my brow, for I the am the chief of sinners. I am a
   sinner not only generally but particularly, for I have broken this Law
   and that Law and I have gone astray always.

   "But Jesus came to seek and to save that which was lost and You have
   said, 'This is a faithful saying.' It is, Lord and therefore I believe
   it. And You have added--'It is worthy of all acceptation.' Therefore,
   good Lord, I accept it. I believe that Jesus came to save sinners. I
   trust myself in His hands to save me." It is done, it is done! You are
   saved, you are saved! Your sins are gone. Your unrighteousnesses are
   forgiven. You are accepted in the Beloved. What makes this plan so
   hard?

   Brethren, it is hard because it is so easy. If it were a hard way of
   salvation, man would like it. But because it is so easy we cannot bear
   it. We are so proud, that to be saved on charity, to come to Christ and
   trust Him to save us, to have done with saving ourselves and to let Him
   do it all--oh, this is so humbling! It will just suit you, then, poor
   Soul, for you have said in the words of my text, "All our
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Come before God and say, "Lord, by
   His agony and bloody sweat, by His Cross and passion, by His precious
   death and burial, have mercy upon me." And He will answer you when you
   make mention of the blood. He will say--"Your sins which are many are
   forgiven you."

   Oh, there is hope yet, lost Soul. There is hope yet! To the very gates
   of Hell let my voice ring this morning--lost Soul, there is hope yet.
   If you have passed those gates there is no hope. But this side of the
   gates of Hell there is hope for you. Not in yourself, but in Jesus is
   your help found. Look to Him. He dies--one look will save you. Look to
   Him. He lives. He pleads before the Father's Throne. Faith in the
   living Savior will make you a living soul.

   May God in His mercy empty you of self, and then faith is easy. But
   until you are brought there, faith is impossible. May you be brought to
   know that you are utterly lost, and then when I pronounce the words of
   Christ--"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved"--you
   will joyfully obey the Divine commandment and you will find in Christ
   all that your needy spirit wants.

   I ask the prayers of the Church very earnestly that God may bless the
   testimony of this morning to the fetching in of many. "Brethren, pray
   for us." Do not cease your prayers. Oh, that we may have an ingathering
   to the Church again as we have had so many times and unto Him, even to
   Him shall be the honor forever! Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

                              God Or Self--Which?

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 9, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Speak unto all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, When
   you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those
   seventy years, did you at all fast unto Me, even to Me? And when you
   did eat and when you did drink, did not you eat for yourselves and
   drink for yourselves." Zechariah 7:5, 6.

   AFTER the Jewish people had been thoroughly cured of their idolatrous
   tendencies by their seventy years of captivity, they fell into another
   evil--they became superstitiously regardful of ceremonies but they lost
   the life and spirit of devotion and neglected the weightier matters of
   the Law.

   Phariseeism, in the spirit of it, had commenced, in the time of
   Zechariah. Great attention was paid to the formalities and externals of
   worship, but the vitality of godliness was unknown. The mint, the
   anise, the cummin of religion--these were all strictly tithed. But
   truth, mercy, charity, justice, were trod under foot. They multiplied
   ceremonies to themselves, apart from God's Word. They had fasts which
   Moses never commanded, and feasts of which the tabernacle in the
   wilderness knew nothing.

   They had ordained for themselves a certain fast for the burning of the
   temple by the Chaldees, and a question which seemed to them very
   important had arisen, as to whether this fast should be observed now
   that the temple was rebuilt. The Jews in Persia sent an honorable
   deputation to Jerusalem upon this important matter. They received no
   direct answer, for it was nothing to the Lord their God whether they
   fasted or not, since He had not commanded it, and could not accept
   their will-worship at their hands.

   Learn this, then, with regard to all religious ceremonies whatever. If
   they are not expressly commanded of God, it is a small matter how men
   keep them. In fact, it were vastly better if they left them alone. Some
   time ago in convocation, the very wonderful question was discussed as
   to whether a child's father and mother might be its godfather and
   godmother. Is there not a prior question? Does the Lord ordain such
   offices in His Word? And again, has He anywhere commanded infants to be
   sprinkled?

   What matters it how the deed is done if the Lord has not ordained it in
   Holy Scripture? To the Law and to the testimony. If you find it not
   there, though you keep every rubric of your Church, you have not done
   it unto God, for He has not required it at your hands. "In vain they do
   worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." I would
   that all our Churches were willing to search for the foundation of all
   their ceremonies in Scripture. This is the way to promote true
   Christian unity. Not to hide our views but to speak plainly. Not to
   settle down upon our old rituals, but to examine them and see whether
   they are of God or not, for let us be sure of this--if we do anything
   which is not according to God's Word, in whatever spirit we may do it,
   or however well we may perform it--it is not a service that God can
   accept of us.

   However, though these deputies obtained no answer upon that point,
   since it was not material whether they did fast or not, yet they had
   some information upon a much more vital matter. They were informed by
   the questions asked of them, that all religion must have God for its
   object, or else it was nothing before Him. The question was solemnly
   asked of them and upon its answer all depended--"When you fasted did
   you fast unto Me? Or when you feasted on your solemn feast days did you
   not eat to yourselves and drink to yourselves?"

   I shall try, this morning, to work out this great Scriptural Truth,
   first showing that in our religious worship our doing it unto God is
   the main thing. Secondly, that in the world our service to God must be
   done for His own sake, or else it is nothing. And, thirdly, we shall
   use our text as a test of our condition before God, asking ourselves
   solemnly whether we have lived unto God, or whether we have been all
   this while living to ourselves, eating to ourselves, and drinking to
   ourselves.

   I. First of all, then, WITH REGARD TO OUR RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. You know,
   Brethren, there are various modes in which the Christian Church
   attempts to worship God. And we are not about, this morning, to discuss
   the ac-ceptableness of these different methods--whether it shall be by
   book or extemporary--whether it shall be with sound of music or with
   the joyous voices of men and women. Whether the ceremony shall be
   pompous or simple--whether it shall be under the consecrated dome, or
   in an ordinary chamber.

   These are matters of secondary importance, for they concern only the
   carcass, while we have now to deal with the soul of worship. We are apt
   to fall into a mistake and value the services of Sunday for something
   which God does not regard. For instance, in the singing of God's
   praises it is well to have melody that we may sing with our
   understanding as well as with our spirit. But after all, if any man
   shall be satisfied because his voice has been in tune and time, in
   singing the words of the Psalm, and if he shall think that therefore he
   has praised God, alas, how mistaken he is!

   Or in the prayer. If we shall think that a certain fluency, an apparent
   reverence and propriety of expression are the only necessary things,
   and if we forget that we are worshipping God, alas, what is our prayer?
   We might as well have been dumb. And if in preaching our hearers shall
   regard merely the orthodoxy of the doctrine, or the eloquence, or the
   fitness of the style, alas, they have not worshipped God, because in
   all this they forget the question "Have you heard as unto God? Have you
   sung as unto God? Did you pray as unto God?"

   For if not, though the sermon is orthodox and eloquent, though the
   singing is as the voice of many waters, though the prayer goes up to
   Heaven and seems to be unexceptionable in expression, yet the worship
   is only vain and worthless, lacking holiness unto the Lord, since it is
   not done as unto God and is not really an offering unto Him. Take that
   as the guide, this morning, and I think I may speak home to your
   consciences.

   How many who frequent the House of Prayer, worship God carelessly? They
   sing, but with no more heart than if they were singing in their own
   houses some common ditty. The prayer is offered and often that is the
   dullest part of the service, and their eyes are gazing about here and
   there. Or if the eyes of the head are shut, the eyes of their hearts
   are open enough, looking not, however, to God, but to vanity. And when
   the sermon is delivered they care but little for its precious message,
   or if they lend some attention, yet what a weariness it is!

   You see in some congregations nodding heads and eyes that are given to
   slumber. They think there is nothing particular in hearing the Gospel.
   They listen to the entreaty of God's ambassador as to a thrice told
   tale but that is all. Were it an oration upon politics, they night be a
   great deal more enthusiastic than they are, and if it were anything
   which touched their personal estates, they would be forward to catch
   every word. But as it is only about their souls, only about eternity,
   only about God, it does not mean much!

   Now, think--do you really think that your thus coming up to God's House
   is acceptable in His sight? If you come thus, you have not come to Him.
   You have not come to worship Him. How can He take this at your hands?
   What would you think if a courtier, who should pretend to be doing
   honor to his monarch, should be nodding before the throne, sleeping in
   the audience chamber? What would you think if some person should have
   the audience of a king, and while the petition is yet in his hands,
   should be gazing about with a vacant stare, or turning his back upon
   the throne?

   Surely this were insult, instead of homage, and well might the gates of
   the palace be barred forever against the wretch whose conduct should be
   thus infamous. Let us take care that we are not satisfied with merely
   sitting in our pews and maintaining an apparently decorous behavior in
   God's House, for--

   "God abhors the sacrifice, Where not the heart is found.
   A larger number of our attendants miss the mark in another way. They
   are not altogether careless, but still their worship is not done as
   unto God, for they are content with the service itself. Provided they
   have sung--have somewhat joined in the prayer--and to some degree
   enjoyed the service, they are content, although no dew from Heaven
   rests upon their hearts. They look merely to man and no further, and if
   the minister should be in a low frame of mind--and what mortal can help
   that at times?--these persons, never having learned to seek God in His
   sanctuary, say that it was no means of Divine Grace to their souls.
   The pitcher was empty and as they had not learned to draw directly from
   the well, they went home thirsty. They looked to the man and never
   thought of his Master. It is no marvel that the opportunity has been a
   lost one to them. Blessed are they who come up to God's House to use
   the means, but not to rest in them--but rather desiring to find the God
   of the means in the means! Oh, how glorious it is when the song carries
   me up to Heaven's courts! How blessed when the prayer is offered, if my
   soul can breathe its desire into the ear of Christ and have fellowship
   with Him. Oh, it is blessed to be in God's House when the Lord Himself
   is in our midst!
   What if the preacher should miscarry?--if all the while I am lifting up
   my heart to God, desiring that His Truth should be blessed to me, I
   shall profit under him. He may be clownish, but he will not be so to
   me. His expressions may be out of order, but they will reach my heart.
   And even if his heart should not be affected, yet mine will be if I am
   having dealings with God and not with man.
   Oh, how many of you come here to hear the man, to gratify your
   curiosity, to regale your ears, to find matter for conversation--but
   not to behold the beauty of the Lord, nor to enquire in His Temple.
   Well, we are glad to see you anyhow, for we hope that being in the way,
   God will meet with you. But I would have you savingly converted, and
   then you will come here to hear God's Word, to talk to God, to speak to
   God. Is it not true that some of you do not use the Day of Rest and the
   House of Prayer for their real purpose, which is that man may meet with
   God?
   There was a man who professed great love to his friend and therefore he
   would spend a day in his company. He rapped at the door and the servant
   said the master was not at home. "It does not matter," he said, "I will
   wait inside and take my ease. I shall do quite as well though the
   master is not at home if you will bring me abundance to eat and drink."
   So he entered and took a chair and made himself very comfortable and
   feasted to his heart's content. And he went home boasting that he had
   enjoyed the visit.
   Then his companions asked him--"Was the master there?" "Oh no, he was
   not there." "But I thought you went to see him?" He had pretended a
   great desire to have converse with his friend but evidently he was
   lying, for if he had gone to see the master and the master had not been
   at home, he would have said--"Well, I will call another day but I have
   missed my errand this time."

   So there are some who go up to the House of God. They think they go
   there to worship the Lord. They have no enjoyment of His Presence, they
   have no communion with His Son, they have no indwelling of His Spirit
   but they enjoy the day for all that, which shows they did not go to
   worship God at all. When we put the question to them--"Did you at all
   fast unto the Lord" their answer must be--"No, verily, we only sought
   self. We did not seek the Master's Presence."

   But there are others and these are not a few, who think they worship
   God acceptably when they merely do so as a matter of custom. It is a
   lamentable fact that in many of the suburban parts of this great city,
   where new villas are rising up, thousands of the people never attend
   any place of worship--I will not say because, being in the country,
   they are withdrawn from the wholesome restraints of society, but
   because, at any rate they do not feel its constraints.

   They can spend the morning in bed, or the afternoon in the garden, too
   glad that they are not under the sorrowful burden of going to a place
   of worship. But with some of you it is the reverse. You are in such a
   position that you would hardly be counted respectable if you did not
   frequent a Church or Chapel--and so you go. The Sunday morning very
   properly sees you arrayed in your best garments and you enter the House
   of God with the multitude. But if you go there only as a matter of
   custom, do not think that God accepts your worship, for you rather obey
   your neighbors than your

   God.

   Have you ever heard of the traveler, who, when he was in Protestant
   England, was accounted a devout follower of the Reformers? Sometime,
   when his course of journey led him to Rome, and as often as there was
   the mass, he might be observed among the crowd, bowing as they bowed, a
   thorough Papist. Soon he made a journey to Mecca that he might see the
   world and there, among the Mohammedan, he was as reverent as any--quite
   willing to receive the dogma of the Prophet.

   Some who heard of it said, "What is this? How can you act so?" And he
   said, "Oh, when I am in Rome, I do as Rome does. And when I am at
   London, I do as London does. And when I am at Mecca I do as Mecca may
   do. It is all the same to me," and straightway all who knew him
   despised him. We have some such in England. They happen to live near
   Christian people and they do the same as they do. Oh, my dear Hearers,
   I fear many of you would have been idolaters if that had been the
   custom of the country, and if so, what is the value of your worship?

   No doubt, also, there is a small sprinkling of people attending all
   places of worship who come as a matter of profit, which is detestable.
   We have heard of some country towns--I do not think it takes place much
   in London, for it does not pay--where people ask, "Which is the most
   respectable congregation in this town? We must take a seat there." Now
   what are they doing when they pretend to be worshipping God? Why, Sirs,
   if that is the reason why they go to a certain place of worship, they
   are following their trade on the Lord's day--and as far as the sin of
   it goes, they might as well have their shop open as shut--for they
   carry their shops on their backs to the place of worship.

   We suspect that some come among us for this reason. Christ had such
   followers. There were loaves and fishes to be given away, and therefore
   they fell into raptures--"What a sweet Preacher! What a profitable
   ministry! We are so fed under Him." And they flocked in multitudes to
   listen to Him that they might afterwards eat and be filled.

   I remember one case of this kind that came under my own knowledge.
   Preaching about in the country, I had often noticed in a certain
   county, a man in a smock frock who was a regular follower. He seemed to
   be amazingly attentive to the service, and thinking that he looked an
   extremely poor man, I one day gave him five shillings. When I preached
   twenty miles off he was there again, and I gave him some more help
   fancying that he was a tried child of God. When I was preaching in
   another place in the same county, he was there again! The thought
   suddenly struck me whether that man did not find something more
   attractive in the palms of my hands than in the words of my lips, so I
   gave him no more.

   The next time I saw him he put himself in my way but I avoided him. And
   then, at last being again in the same county, he came up and asked me
   to give him something. "No," I said, "you will not have anything now. I
   see what you have come for. You have only come pretending to delight in
   the Word and to be so profited by it, whereas it is profit you get out
   of me, not profit from the Gospel." These people--there are such in all
   congregations--ought, at least, to be well aware that their pretended
   worship of God is detestable in His sight.

   If you have had meat in your hands and a dog has followed you, you
   might feel pleased that the dog had taken a great affection to your
   person. But as soon as the meat was gone, when he turned his tail, you
   discovered that it was an affection for the meat and not for you. Such
   are some who come to God's House. They have an affection for what is
   given by the charity of the saints, but they have no love to the saints
   nor to the saints' Master. The sooner such people mend their ways, the
   better. This cupboard love, this love of God for what they get out of
   Him, is despicable to honest men, and it must be an abomination in the
   sight of the Most High.

   Once more only upon this point. Beyond a doubt, some public worship is
   offered by those who attend our sanctuaries, in the idea that they are
   getting merit by it. Well, Sir, and so you prayed because you thought
   to atone for sin by it? You sang to help yourself to Heaven? You heard
   a sermon to help yourself to be accepted before God? You have done it
   to yourself, and the Lord's voice to you is--"Did you at all fast unto
   Me, even to Me? Did you not eat unto yourselves and drink unto
   yourselves?"

   All religious worship done with a view that we may thereby be
   meritoriously saved, is really only a service rendered unto our own
   interests and not unto God. How can we expect the Eternal One to accept
   as an offering to Himself, what is really an offering to our own
   selfishness? "But is not a man to do anything to save himself?" you
   ask. No, I answer--NO! NO! NO! He is to let Christ save him. By faith,
   he is to put himself in Christ's hands, that Christ may save him. Then
   after that he may do as much as ever he can out of gratitude to his
   Savior.

   Why, Sirs, when your servile works are done to gain a righteousness, do
   you think you win the approbation of Heaven? What? Build a palace for
   God out of the mud of your own selfishness? Think that God can be
   bribed to bless you by deeds which you have done with self as a motive?
   God hates that which a man does with the idea that he can win the
   Lord's love. You must come to God as undeserving of anything at His
   hands. Take His love and His mercy freely, and then go and do good
   works, and pray, and sing, and preach if you can, but never with a view
   of getting good to your-selves--but only that you may glorify Him and
   at last may enter into His rest.

   I say, and with this I leave the point, that that Worship, and that
   worship only, which is for God and not for self in any sense, God
   accepts. And whether it is with a view to temporal profit, or from mere
   custom, or with a view to merit, that we attend to spiritual
   ordinances, rites, ceremonies, or what not--we have done nothing that
   God can receive-- and we might as well have left the whole undone.

   II. But now I shall turn to a wider circle for a moment or two. BY THIS
   WE MAY TEST ALL THE OTHER RELIGIOUS ACTS OF MEN.

   Many a brave deed has been done with the sound of which the world has
   rung for years which nevertheless has never been received by the Most
   High. Some have served God out of ostentation, that they might show
   what great things they could do. Remember Jehu when he said, "Come, see
   my zeal for the Lord God of Hosts." Jehu has many imitators.

   "Lend me your pen, Sir." "Yes." "I hereby write my name for five
   thousand pounds at the head of the list. Is not that an acceptable
   offering to God? There are very few in England that will give as much
   as I have--report it in all the newspapers. Shouldn't the world know
   that there still exists one liberal man?" Is not that splendid gift
   accepted? No, Brethren, certainly not, because it was given for his own
   praise and for his own glory and not for the glory of God.

   If it is our earnestness in preaching the Gospel, if we are only
   earnest in order that people may think us earnest--if we are only
   zealous that men may say of us, "That man does more than the rest. What
   a zealous, earnest man he is"--we have offered nothing to God. We have
   been sacrificing on our own shrines and offering incense before our own
   image.

   A certain king had a minstrel and he bade him play before him. It was a
   day of high feasting. The cups were flowing and many great guests were
   assembled. The minstrel laid his fingers among the strings of his harp
   and woke them all to the sweetest melody, but the hymn was to the glory
   of himself. It was a celebration of the exploits of song which the bard
   had himself performed. He had excelled high Howell's harp and emulated
   great Llewellyn's lay. In high-sounding strains he sang of himself and
   all his glories.

   When the feast was over the harpist said to the monarch, "Oh King, give
   me my guerdon. Let the minstrel be paid." And the king said, "You have
   sung unto yourself--pay yourself--your own praises were your theme. Be
   yourself the paymaster." He cried, "Did I not sing sweetly? O, king,
   give me the gold!" But the king replied, "So much the worse for your
   pride that you should lavish such sweetness upon yourself."

   Brethren, even if a man should grow gray-headed in the performance of
   good works, yet when at the last, if it is known that he has done it
   all to himself, his Lord will say, "You have done well enough in the
   eyes of man but so much the worse, because you did it only to yourself,
   that your own praises might be sung, and that your own name might be
   extolled." That is a singular text in Hosea--"Israel is an empty vine.
   He brings forth fruit unto himself." There was fruit, only it was
   brought forth to himself, which before God is emptiness.

   Take care of ostentation. Be ready to serve God when none can see you.
   Prefer not to let your right hand know what your left hand does. Shun
   the very thought of getting a market for your own honor. Go behind the
   wall and serve your Master, sooner than sound the trumpet before you in
   the streets. When Mr. Morrison, the Missionary to China, needed an
   assistant, Mr. Milne, afterwards the celebrated Dr. Milne, offered
   himself. As soon as the examiners had talked with him, they saw that
   his heart was right enough but he had a clownish look and a dullness of
   expression.

   When the youth was gone out of the room, one of the examiners said, "He
   is scarcely a proper person to send, we need a man of greater
   intellect." At last they agreed that they had better send him as a
   servant, the servant of the mission, to do the work of the
   household--clean Dr. Morrison's boots and such like things, I suppose.
   So Dr. Phillip was requested to communicate this to him and he told him
   that the committee did not feel he was qualified to go as a Missionary,
   would he mind going as a servant? The youth's eye sparkled and he said,
   "It is too much honor for me even if I am but a hewer of wood and a
   drawer of water for the Lord my God."

   And thus he went forth and afterwards, as you know, became one of the
   most useful of missionaries. How many a man would have said,
   "Gentlemen, I did not come for that. This is treating me with a want of
   respect. Surely you do not know who I am, or else you would not suppose
   for a moment that I would be willing to be a mere drudge, and menial
   servant!" They know not the Lord who only desire His service for the
   honor which it brings--but they have their hearts right before Him who
   want no honor for themselves but only desire that His name may be
   extolled above the hills--that He may be made famous in the earth.

   What would you say of a workman whom you should employ to build a house
   for you and who, when the house was done, should prepare a piece of
   stone with his own name upon it to be put right in the front so that
   everybody might say that he had built it? Why, you would say, "No, Sir,
   it is mine to choose the inscription. It is my house, not yours." Did
   you ever hear of a pen that after a book had been written, required its
   own name placed at the bottom? It was enough for the real author to be
   known. What mattered it whether it was a gold pen, or a steel pen, or a
   quill pen that wrote it?

   So you and I are only God's pens. He uses us and why ought we to care
   to be known? No, let the real Author be known, for "we are His
   workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works." There was the
   difference between John Wesley and George Whitfield. Mr. George
   Whitfield had all the popularity of Mr. Wesley and all the opportunity
   that John had to make a denomination but he said, "No. I do not condemn
   my Brother, John, but I could not do what he does. Let my name perish.
   Let only Christ's name last forever."

   The day will come when the man who was willing that his name should
   perish rather than it should supplant the brighter name of Christ, will
   shine all the brighter for this self-denial. Let us mind that we have
   no sinister ends, no selfish objects in view. But let it be God alone,
   Christ alone, and His glory alone, or else we may ask ourselves the
   question afresh--"Did you at all fast unto Me, even to Me? And when you
   did eat and when you did drink, did not you eat for yourselves and
   drink for yourselves?"

   Again upon this point. How many of our religious actions, our attempts
   to propagate the Gospel of Christ have been very greatly promoted by
   strife and rivalry? Sometimes the strife has occurred in a single
   congregation, and a new Chapel has been built because some few
   disrespectful words were spoken and a slight disagreement ripened and
   rotted into a quarrel. The general public has thought, "Well, the
   persons who contributed to that new place must certainly have done some
   service to God." But it may be that it was really service to the devil,
   for they only built it that they might gratify their own resentments
   and say to those whom they left, "See how well we can do without you."

   How often have different Christians strived to increase their
   congregations or their denominations out of a spirit of jealous
   rivalry? The Wesleyans were awake, therefore the Baptists must be. Or
   the Church of England had a school and therefore the Dissenters must.
   How many have run in the race that they might keep up with, or exceed
   their rivals? Now concerning religious rivalry and religious strife,
   whatever others may have said of it, we only say, "These things are not
   of God." The Lord may say of all that we have ever done out of mere
   denominational pride, out ofjealousy and to make our own names great in
   the earth--"Did you at all fast unto Me, even to Me? When you did eat
   and when you did drink, did you not do it unto yourselves?"

   I would to God we were all contending earnestly for the faith and
   provoking one another to love and to good works! But to do good for the
   mere sake of doing more than some person whom I look upon as my rival
   is not serving God. It is indulging my weaker passions under the
   pretense of honoring the Lord. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, I have had to
   ask myself this question scores of times, "Have I done it unto God?" I
   have gone groaning from this platform because I could not preach as I
   wished, but this has been my comfort, "Well, I did desire to glorify
   Christ. I did desire to free my conscience of the blood of men. I did
   want to tell men the whole Truth of God whether they liked it or not."

   But sometimes when I have got on better and the words have flowed
   fluently and the sentences have had a little polish about them (they
   have not much at any time) I have thought, "Well, I went on pretty well
   this morning." Just then my conscience has smote me--"You made the
   people pleased but did you glorify your Master? Did you lay the axe at
   the foot of the tree? Did you come down on their consciences? Did you
   strive to drive the nail right into their hearts? You might have done
   better with rougher words than with those garnished utterances."

   I have no uneasiness about rough sentences, but I have, when I have not
   been earnest in my Master's cause. Oh, I think it must be so with you,
   sometimes. You Sunday school teachers, are you sure that you teach for
   Jesus Christ? May it not be possible that you teach for custom, or that
   you do it because you like the association of your fellow teachers? You
   tract distributors, are you sure that when you distribute the tracts it
   is with an idea of winning souls to Christ? Is it not because your
   conscience tells you you ought to be doing something?

   And you who go out preaching, are you sure that you preach only for
   Christ's glory? Does it not sometimes happen that you are tempted to
   glorify yourselves, and try to be fine and great when you ought to be
   simple and plain and earnest with the souls of men? Oh, when I think of
   some who spend all the week writing out their sermons and touching up
   every line and every sentence, I fear there must be something of self
   there! And when I hear some preachers with such splendid diction, with
   words so nicely picked, I cannot help thinking that there must be a
   sacrificing to the genius of oratory or to the beauty of eloquence,
   rather than to the Master's cause. I say of everything that is done for
   self--down with it! Down with it! Let Dagon fall! Break these images,
   every one of them--smite them like the proud Philistine or the boastful
   Babylonian king. What have we to do with idolatrous self-worship? O
   Lord, deliver us from it!

   I shall not detain you longer upon this point when I have said another
   word. Though this is a Protestant land it is beyond all question that
   there are some Popish enough to perform great religious acts by way of
   merit. What a goodly row of almshouses was erected by that miserly old
   grinder of the poor as an atonement for his hoarding propensities! What
   a splendid donation to that hospital! A very proper thing, indeed, but
   the person who left it never gave a farthing to a beggar in his life!
   And he would not have given it now, only he could not take it with him
   and so he has left it as an atonement for sin.

   Sometimes persons think that the doing of some outrageous religious act
   will take them to Heaven--frequenting Church prayer twice a day,
   fasting in Lent, decorating the altar with needlework, putting stained
   glass in the window, giving a new organ or such like. At the suggestion
   of their priest they do many such things, and thus they go on working
   like blind asses at a mill, from morning to night and make as much real
   progress. Do I address any such persons here? I do not find fault with
   you for what you do, but I do find fault with you for why you are doing
   it. If you dream that you are saving yourselves, remember that your
   acts are selfish acts and that there is nothing good in them.

   They may be good things in themselves, but as they are done not unto
   God, but evidently with a view to your own welfare, they are done to
   yourselves and He will not, therefore, accept them. Let there be never
   such splendid deeds of alms-giving, never such marvelous mortifications
   of the flesh, never such devout attendance at daily prayer--they avail
   nothing before God--when they proceed from a self-righteous heart. Away
   with them! Away with them all! They are dross and dung before the Most
   High, if you bring them to Him with a view of purchasing salvation. No,
   you must have done with these, and trust in Jesus only. When a man can
   say, "I am saved. Christ is mine"--then he can serve God acceptably and
   his deeds shall be received through Christ Jesus.

   III. Now for our last point. It seems to me that our text may be a TEST
   OF OUR SPIRITUAL STATE.

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus, may I solemnly ask you now to put
   your souls into the scales for a few minutes by way of
   self-examination. What can you and I say with regard to our lives since
   we have known the Lord? Have we lived unto Christ? Dare we take the
   Apostle Paul's motto--"For me to live is Christ, to die is gain"? Oh,
   Beloved, it is not what we have done, so much as with what object we
   have done it. For every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the
   Lord weighs the heart. Have we in our hearts longed to serve Him?

   "Oh," I hear one say, "it was little I could do, Sir. I was poor. I
   could not give Him gold. I was uneducated, I could not give Him words."
   Ah, my Brethren, it is possible that what you have been able to do may
   be more acceptable than what some others have done, if you can say, "I
   did not desire my own honor. I was content to be humble, to be obscure,
   to be unknown and to be forgotten, if I might but lift Him up and
   praise Him in my little sphere and make Him glorious among men."

   I fear, Beloved Brethren, that some of us do but little for Christ,
   even outwardly, and I blush to confess that in that little which we do
   there is so much that is spoiled by our looking after self. Have we not
   sometimes prayed at the Prayer Meeting with the view of being thought
   gifted men! Have we not joined a Church that we might be a little
   better thought of? May we not have labored more abundantly that there
   might be the whisper about--"So-and-So is a flourishing Christian, a
   useful man"?

   Do we not compliment ourselves thus--"Well, people think very highly of
   me. They say such-and-such, and it must be all right"? Are we not
   smuggling over the frontier some of the merchandise of pride? It has
   been lately remarked, and not before it was necessary, that this is an
   age in which the word pride means what it never meant before. You hear
   gentlemen on the platform say, "I am proud." You hear the minister,
   himself, when speaking of something that has been done for him, "I am
   proud." The words, "I am proud," do not mean any hurt now, because we
   have forgotten that pride in any shape and in every shape is detestable
   in the eyes of God.

   We even talk of a decent pride. I saw a good young woman the other
   day--I dare say she is here this morning--and she told me she could not
   come now on a Sunday because her clothes were getting so bad. And she
   said, "I thought it was decent pride to stop coming." And I said, "No,
   my Sister, no pride is decent." I saw her last Sunday standing down
   there and I have no doubt she enjoyed what was said as well in her
   cotton dress as she would have done if she could have worn her silk
   one. All pride is indecent.

   A few Sundays ago, when we had the mourning for Prince Albert, some
   people could not go to Church because the dressmakers had been so busy
   that they could not get their black things ready and it was called
   decent pride which kept them at home. But I say again--it was indecent
   pride--indecent pride such as the Lord God of Hosts abhors. We must
   have done with these prides, but yet I do fear that pride has so mixed
   with all we have done and so stained our best acts, that we have reason
   to cry out this morning, "All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.
   Lord have mercy upon us, for Jesus' sake."

   There is another arrow in my quiver and it must be shot. Alas, alas! I
   address some this morning who never did anything for God in their
   lives. To whom it would make no difference if there were no God at all,
   except that they would be rather glad than otherwise. A man--a man,
   mark that--made in the image of his maker and yet he has never said a
   good word for his Creator! The breath in his nostrils this morning is
   the gift of God. The comforts of his home are gifts from the liberality
   of the God that has made him, and yet he has never done anything for
   that God in his life!

   Touch him upon the point of what he has done for man and he may have
   done much--let men applaud him. If a great general has won battles for
   men, let men honor him. If a philanthropist has done much for men--let
   men be grateful. If you have spent your time for your families, let
   your families thank you. But there are some here who have done nothing
   for God. "Hear, O Heavens and give ear O Earth. I have nourished and
   brought up children, and they have rebelled against Me. The ox knows
   his owner and the ass his master's crib but they know not, neither do
   they consider."

   A man would not keep even a dog which never looked to him with
   thankfulness, never frisked about his feet with joy at his liberality.
   And yet here are men more brutish than their own dogs--fed by God and
   never thankful to Him--they have never done anything for Him in all
   their lives! I know there are many here who, if their consciences sleep
   not, must stand convicted. Again I repeat it, we will not touch you
   upon the point of what you have done for man--but let me remind you
   that man did not make you--that it is not your deeds for others that
   can save you, it is not your nation that can save your soul.

   It is God! It is God and yet you have forgotten Him and He is not in
   all your thoughts. You can go to bed without a prayer to Him. You can
   rise in the morning without a hymn of thankfulness! A God forgotten in
   His own world, a God unknown by His own creatures, a God--and such a
   God! So good, so gracious, so tender, so loving--a God who has given
   His own Son to die, and yet by His own creature so lightly deemed, that
   he gives Him not a word or thought.

   Well, Soul, well, Sinner, what a mercy it is that God has not forgotten
   you. If He had forgotten to give you your bread, where had you been? If
   He had forgotten to let the sun shine on you--if He had forgotten to
   let the fields yield their har-vests--if He had forgotten to keep back
   the fever--if He had forgotten you when you were lying last year upon a
   sick bed-- or when you were out in that storm at sea and the wind had
   rent away the mast--or when your gun exploded in your hand-- you had
   been howling in Hell now! But He has not forgotten you and you are yet
   alive. Oh, may His long-suffering lead you to repentance for having
   lived as if there were no God to love and yourself the only thing worth
   caring for!

   But, Soul, let me remind you that long-suffering does not last forever.
   The Roman judges were attended by lictors, as you know. These lictors
   carried on their shoulders a bundle of rods, and in the center an axe.
   Now, when the judge condemned any man to be beaten by the rods, the
   following scene always took place. The rods were tied about with
   leather thongs, which were knotted a great many times. When the judge
   condemned the man to be beaten, his back was stripped, the lictor then
   untied one knot, and then another and another, which took some little
   time and during all this time the judge was looking in the face of the
   person to be scourged, watching him to see if he saw hardness of heart
   and rebellion there.

   If he did, then the blows came heavy, and perhaps the axe followed. But
   if he looked in the criminal's face and saw repentance expressed there,
   it often happened that before the last knot was untied, the judge would
   say, "the punishment is remitted, tie up the rods again."

   Now, you that have forgotten God, remember His rods, too, are bound up
   with many knots. Many of those knots have been untied for some of you.
   Six years ago you laid ill with the cholera. There was a knot untied
   then. Before that you had had many warnings that were like loosening of
   the knots. And now, this morning, the fingers of Eternal Justice are
   loosening another of the knots.

   Sinner, it may be it is the last, and God is looking in your face. And
   what does He see there? Does He see a brow of brass? Is your heart
   saying, "I have loved pleasure and after it I will go"? Then it is
   possible that Justice will untie the last knot and then comes the axe.
   Take heed, Sinner, when once God's axe is taken, you can not escape it.
   He shall dash you in pieces and there is none to deliver.

   O God of mercy, touch the sinner's heart and make him repent. Compel
   him to feel his need of Christ. Lord, lead him to Jesus and then, by
   Your Grace, the rods shall never be untied and he shall never be
   smitten!

                             The Danger Of Doubting

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 16, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of
   Saul.'" 1 Samuel 27:1.
   To doubt the loving kindness of God is thought by some to be a very
   small sin. In fact, some have even exalted the doubts and fears of
   God's people into fruits and grace and evidences of great advancement
   in experience. It is humiliating to observe that certain ministers have
   pampered and petted men in unbelief and distrust of God, being in this
   matter false to their Master and to the souls of His people.
   Far be it from me to smite the feeble of the flock. But their sins I
   must and will smite, since it is my firm conviction that to doubt the
   kindness, the faithfulness, and the love of God is a very heinous
   offense. Unbelief is akin to Atheism. Atheism denies God's
   existence--unbelief denies His goodness and since goodness is essential
   to God, these doubts do, in reality, stab at His very Being. That can
   be no light sin which makes God a liar.
   And yet unbelief does, in effect, cast foul and slanderous suspicion
   upon the veracity of the Holy One of Israel. That can be no small
   offense which charges the Creator of Heaven and earth with perjury. And
   yet, if I mistrust His oath, and will not believe His promises sealed
   with the blood of His own Son, I count the oath of God to be unworthy
   of my trust. And so I do, in very deed, accuse the King of Heaven as
   false to His Covenant and oath.
   Besides, as I shall have to show this morning, unbelief of God is the
   fountain of innumerable sins. As the black cloud is the mother of many
   raindrops, so dark unbelief is the parent of many crimes. And what if I
   should say that unbelief concentrates the vice of ages into a moment,
   and gathers up the virus of all the offenses of the race in one
   transgression? I should not be far from the mark.
   But I shall say no strong words in the preface, because methinks the
   incident in David's history, to which I shall call your attention this
   morning, will be in itself enough to lead you to give your verdict with
   mine--that unbelief is a damnable sin, that it should be condemned by
   every Believer, should be struggled against, should if possible be
   subdued-- and certainly should be the object of our deep repentance and
   abhorrence.
   Now let us listen to David, and may his sin and sorrow be as beacons to
   warn us from evil! "David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day
   by the hand of Saul." First, I shall remark that what he said in his
   heart was false. Secondly, we shall ask the question, how he came to
   think so? And then we shall notice, in the third place, what mischief
   came of such a hard unbelieving thought.
   I. First, THE THOUGHT OF DAVID'S HEART WAS FALSE. He said, "I shall now
   perish one day by the hand of
   Saul."

   We might conclude it to be false upon the very face of it, because
   there certainly was no evidence to prove it. On no one occasion had the
   Lord deserted His servant. He had been placed in perilous positions
   very often, but not one single instance had occurred in which God's
   strength was not sufficient for him. The trials to which he had been
   exposed had been varied--they had not assumed one form, only, but many.
   Yet in every case He who sent the trial had also graciously ordained a
   way of escape.

   David could not put his finger upon any entry in his diary and say of
   it, "Here is evidence that God will forsake me." In looking back
   through his whole life, from the time when he kept his father's sheep,
   and slew the lion and the bear, onward to the day when he challenged
   the Philistine, and upward to this moment--when he had just escaped
   from his bloodthirsty pursuer--he could not find a solitary fact which
   should be proof that God had changed His mind and would leave His
   anointed to fall into the hand of his cruel enemy.

   Now, mark--when you and I doubt God's Word there is this to be said of
   it--we mistrust it without a cause. I bear my willing testimony that I
   have no reason to doubt my Lord, nor even the shadow of a reason--and I
   think that you who were in Christ many years before I knew Him can say
   that since you have trusted in Him you have never once had any reason
   to suspect His faithfulness, or to imagine that He would cast you away.

   Brethren, we condemn not a man without evidence. Shall we condemn our
   loving Lord without evidence? I challenge Heaven and earth and Hell
   this morning to bring any proof that God is untrue. From the depths of
   Hell I call the fiends, and from this earth I call the tried and
   afflicted Believers, and to Heaven I appeal and challenge the long
   experience of the blood-washed host--there is not to be found in the
   three realms a single one who can bear evidence of a fact which should
   disprove the goodness of God, or weaken His claim to be trusted by His
   servants.

   Now let our unbelief be thrown out. Let our sense of justice expel it
   at once. Let us be just to God as well as to man. And if never yet has
   He failed any of His people, or broken a solitary promise, far be it
   from us to doubt or to be unbelieving--

   "Thus far we prove that promise good Which Jesus ratified with blood.
   Still He is gracious, wise and just, And still in Him let Israel
   trust."

   But, again, what David said in his heart was not only without evidence
   but it was contrary to evidence. What reason had he to believe that God
   would leave him? Rather, how many evidences had he to conclude that the
   Lord neither could, nor would, leave him? "Your servant slew both the
   lion and the bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of
   them." That was good reasoning. Why not reason like that now, David?
   Why not say, "Your servant slew the Philistine, your servant escaped
   from the javelins of Saul, when the mad monarch would have pinned him
   to the wall.

   "Your servant escaped from all the devices of Doeg, your servant
   escaped when Saul pursued him in the tracks of the wild goats and in
   the caves of Engedi. Your servant escaped out of the power of Achish,
   the Philistine. And, lo, this Saul, who seeks my head, out of his hand
   shall I escape also"? That would have been a rational conclusion, a
   proper way of dealing with evidence. But to say, after such love and
   kindness past, "He will let me sink at last," was to draw a lying
   conclusion and to bring in a verdict directly contrary to the evidence.

   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, your case is similar--at least mine is.
   O Lord God! You have not left us at any time. We have had dark nights,
   but the star of love has shone forth amid the blackness. We have had
   our cloudy days, but our sun has never set until we have had glimpses
   of sunlight from Heaven. We have gone through many trials but never to
   our detriment, always to our advantage. And the conclusion from our
   past experience--at least I can speak of my own posi-tively--is that He
   who has been with us in six troubles will not forsake us in the
   seventh.

   He has said, "I will never, never leave you and will never, never,
   never forsake you." Do not think I repeat these "nevers" too often. I
   repeat the text just as I find it in the Greek. What we have known of
   our faithful God goes to show that He will keep us to the end--and even
   to the last He will be our Helper. Go not, then, contrary to evidence.
   What should we say of a jury who, after having heard a case in which
   the verdict should evidently have been "Not Guilty," should,
   nevertheless, say "Guilty"? Let the earth ring with the cry of
   indignation. A man has been condemned not only unjustly but in the very
   ties of evidence which proved his innocence!

   O Heaven and earth! Ring with the universal indignation of honest men,
   that we should think God untrue, when all the evidence of our past
   lives goes to prove that He is true and faithful to His Word--

   "Our Savior's Word abides sure, His record is on high, He who has made
   our souls secure, Was never known to lie. Munitions of stupendous rock
   Our dwelling place shall be. There shall our souls without a shock The
   wreck of nature see."

   Thirdly, this exclamation of David was contrary to God's promises.
   Samuel had poured the anointing oil on David's head--God's earnest and
   promise that David should be king. Let David die by the hand of Saul
   and how can the promise be fulfilled? Many times had God assured His
   servant David that He had chosen the son of Jesse to be the leader of
   His people. Let him die, and how can that be true? It was, therefore,
   contrary to the promise of God that David should fall by his enemy's
   hand.

   Christian! It is contrary to every promise of this precious Book that
   you should become the victim of the lion of Hell. How, then, could He
   be true who has said, "Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she
   should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, they may
   forget, yet will I never forget you." What were the value of that
   promise--"The mountains shall depart and the hills be removed. But My
   kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall the Covenant of My
   peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy on you"? Where were the
   truth of Christ's words--"I give unto My sheep eternal life. And they
   shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand. My
   Father which gave them Me, is greater than all and no man is able to
   pluck them out of My Father's hand"?

   Where were the Doctrines of Grace? They would be proved to be a lie if
   one child of God should perish! Where were the veracity of God, His
   honor, His power, His Divine Grace, His Covenant, His oath, if any of
   those for whom Christ has died and who have put their trust in Him,
   should nevertheless be cast away? Oh, by this precious Book which you
   believe to be true, unless you are prepared to cast it away as a vile
   thing of falsehood, distrust not your Lord but rather say--

   "The Gospel bears my spirit up. A faithful and unchanging God, Lays the
   foundation for my hope In oaths and promises and blood."

   But further, this wicked exclamation of David was contrary to what he
   himself had often said. Here I convict myself, I remember on one
   occasion, to my shame, being sad and doubtful of heart and a kind
   friend took out a paper and read to me a short extract from a discourse
   upon faith. I very soon detected the author of the extract--my friend
   was reading to me from one of my own sermons. Without saying a word he
   just left it to my own conscience, for he had convicted me of
   committing the very fault against which I had so earnestly declaimed.

   Often might you, Brethren, be found out in the same inconsistency.
   "Oh," you have said, "I could trust Him though the fig tree did not
   blossom and though there were no flocks in the field, and no herd in
   the stall." Ah, you have condemned the unbelief of other people, but
   when it touched you, you have trembled. And when you have come to run
   with the horsemen, they have wearied you, and in the swellings of
   Jordan you have been troubled. So was it with David. What strong words
   he had often said when he addressed others! He said of Saul, "His time
   shall come to die. I will not stretch out my hand and touch the Lord's
   anointed."

   He felt sure that Saul's doom was signed and sealed. And Yet, in the
   hour of his unbelief, he says, "I shall yet one day fall." What a
   strange contradiction was that! What a mercy it is that God changes
   not, for we are changing two or three times a day! Our own utterances,
   our own previous convictions are clean contrary to the idea that He can
   ever leave us or forsake us. I appeal, as did that ancient worthy who
   appealed from Philip drunk to Philip sober, I appeal from Philip
   unbelieving to Philip in a proper state of mind.

   I bring up before you your own thoughts, your own emotions, your own
   joyous shouts of song, your own psalms of victory--and I ask you to
   make these consistent with your present doubts. "Though a host should
   encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should arise
   against me, in this will I be confident." That is David. "I shall one
   day perish by the hand of Saul." That is David, too. "I will love You,
   O Lord, my strength! The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my
   deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler and
   the horn of my salvation and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord,
   who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies."

   That is David. "I shall one day fall by the hand of Saul." That is
   David again. Do not fetch up any other evidence. Let the man convict
   himself. His unbelief is absurd from his own showing. So with you, and
   with me, Brethren. We are great fools when we doubt God and that is
   saying the best of it. What the worst of it is, God only knows. O Lord,
   from this great sin do deliver us!

   Yet once more. This exclamation of David was contrary to the facts. I
   mean not merely contrary to the facts that were in evidence, but
   contrary to the facts that were transpiring at that very moment. Where
   was Saul? Saul was seeking a miserable witch of Endor, to raise Samuel
   from the dead. The spears of the Philistines were being sharpened for
   the battle, and the arrows were being made ready upon the string that
   should reach the heart of the king of Israel. And yet here is David,
   just within a short period of attaining the kingdom and of seeing Saul
   slain, saying, "I shall one day fall by the hand of Saul."

   Oh, if he could have read the mysteries, if he could have understood
   what the right hand of God was doing and what the Eternal One designed
   for him, he would never have whined thus his unbelief. So with you, and
   with me. "Ah, but," you say, "it is not so with me this morning. I am
   brought very low." Yes, and God is getting ready to bring you up very
   high. "Ah, but my trouble is a very dreadful one." Yes and His bare arm
   is a very potent one, and He knows how to deliver His children. "Yes,
   but I do not see." No, and you do not need to see. It is still being
   done.

   God's purposes are ripening. Now, do not misjudge them! Do not antedate
   the time of your deliverance, but patiently wait and quietly hope. I
   know that some of us, when we have escaped from our trials, have said,
   "Well, if I had known it had been so, I would not have been so troubled
   about it." Just so. And now, I pray you, though you do not know it, yet
   still believe it, and do not run contrary to the fact in doubting God.
   You are very poor, are you? But still you take care of your children.

   What would you say to your child if he were sitting down at the table
   crying. "What do you cry for, child?" "Because there is no food for
   me." "Why, silly child," you say, "I was just cutting a slice from the
   loaf. Do not cry till you are sure there is no food." The Lord says to
   us often, "What do you cry for, silly child? This is what I was doing
   behind the mysteries of My Providence, getting ready some sweet and
   precious mercy for you."--

   "The clouds you so much dread,
   Are big with mercies and shal break
   With blessings on your head.
   Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
   But trust Him for His Grace.
   Behind a frowning Providence
   He hides a smiling face."

   II. But I must now, while my strength shall hold out, proceed to the
   second part of the discourse, namely, HOW WAS IT THAT DAVID CAME TO
   THINK THUS OF HIS GOD?

   The first answer I give is, because he was a man. The best of men are
   men at the best, and man at the best is such a creature that well might
   David himself say, "Lord, what is man?" If we always performed feats of
   faith, onlookers might imagine that we were demi-gods. In truth, I say
   that the feats which a man of faith can do, are only surpassed by the
   doings of the Almighty One Himself. Next to omnipotence is faith. No,
   not next to it in some respects, for faith can do all that omnipotence
   can, when God makes it strong.

   What were the hosts of the Philistines to Samson? "Heaps upon heaps
   with the jawbone of an ass, have I slain a thousand men." And what were
   the pillars of the temple to him? He bowed himself with all his
   strength and pulled down the goodly palace of the Philistines upon the
   princes and upon the assembled multitudes. Faith can do everything. But
   if faith never gave place to unbelief, we might be tempted to lift up
   the Believer into a demi-god and think him something more than mortal.

   That we might see that a man full of faith is still a man--that we
   might glory in infirmities, since by them the power of God is the more
   clearly proved--therefore God was pleased to let the feebleness of man
   grievously show itself. Ah, it was not David who achieved these former
   victories but God's Grace in David. And now, when that is removed for a
   moment, see what Israel's champion becomes!

   But again--you must consider that David had been exposed to a very long
   trial. Not for one week, but for month after month he had been hunted
   like a partridge upon the mountains. Now, a man could bear one trial,
   but a perpetuity of tribulation is very hard to bear. To lay one's head
   down upon the block seems to me to be comparatively easy. But to be
   strapped, as were some of the martyrs, to a stake and be roasted at a
   slow fire, hour after hour, while the limbs wither in the heat, must
   have been awful. The martyrdom of an hour is sudden glory, but the
   martyrdom of a life--there needs to be something more than human to
   endure this.

   To be crucified, to have the hands and feet nailed fast, but the vital
   parts intact. To have all the pangs of death, with all the strength of
   life! Now, such was David's trial--always safe but always
   harassed--always secure through God but always hunted about by his foe.
   No place could give him any ease. If he went unto Keilah, then the
   citizens would deliver him up. If he went into the wood of Ziph, then
   the Ziphtes betrayed him. If he went even to the priests of God, there
   was that dog of a Doeg to go to Saul and accuse the priest.

   Even in Engedi or in Adullam he was not secure. He was secure, I grant
   you, in God--but always persecuted by his foe. Now, this was enough to
   make the wise man mad, and to make the faithful man doubt. Do not judge
   David too harshly--at least judge just as harshly yourselves. I think
   that if we also were tempted, we should fall as he did.

   Then again, you must remember, David had passed through some strong
   excitements of mind. Just a day or so before he had gone forth with
   Abishai in the moonlight to the field where Saul and his host lay
   sleeping. They passed the outer circle where the common soldiers lay
   and quietly and stealthily the two heroes passed without awaking any.
   They came at last to the spot where the captains of the hundreds slept
   and they trod over their slumbering bodies without arousing them.

   They reached the spot where Saul lay, with his spear stuck in the earth
   at his bolster and his cruse of water standing, that he might refresh
   himself if he awoke in the night. And Abishai said, "The Lord has
   delivered him into your hands. Let me smite him; I will smite him but
   this once." David holds back Abishai's hand. He will not permit it but
   he says, "As the Lord lives. The Lord shall smite him, or his day shall
   come to die, or he shall descend into battle and perish. The Lord
   forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against the Lord's
   anointed." So he escaped from this temptation, as he had previously,
   when he only cut off the skirt of Saul's robe, instead of smiting him
   as he might have done in the caves of Engedi.

   Now, Brethren, a man may do these great things helped by God, but do
   any of you know that it is a sort of natural law with us, that after a
   strong excitement there is a reaction? I will give you a picture. There
   is Elijah yonder. He has built an altar unto the Lord his God. The
   priests of Baal have built another. Elijah appeals to God. "He that
   answers by fire, let him be God." The priests of Baal supplicate their
   god. He answers not. They cut themselves with lancets and with knives.
   Their dumb idol could not affirm his own deity.

   Elijah mocks them. "Cry aloud," said he, "for he is a god; perhaps he
   sleeps and needs to be awakened." So in grim sarcasm he stirs up the
   wrath of the priests of Baal. No answer comes. Now it is Elijah's turn.
   He bows the knee and lifts up his hands to Heaven. The flame descends.
   Be astonished, you unbelievers! It licks up even the water in the
   trenches and the twelve consecrated stones are themselves consumed and
   are carried in smoke to Heaven, even as the flame of the
   burnt-offering.

   "Take the Prophets of Baal, let not one escape," cries the stern
   Elijah. He grasps one of them and drags him down the hill and the
   willing people follow, dragging by the hair of their heads the false
   priests down to the brook. And then, stripping to his sleeves, he dyes
   himself with the gore and blood of these, the haters of God, and the
   betrayers of His people, till the brook runs red with the smoking blood
   of Baal's priests. Now what will happen after that? When Elijah gets
   away from all this heroic daring, because he is a man, there will be a
   reaction--and lo, he is afraid of Jezebel, who hunted for his life!

   He cries, "Let me die. I am no better than my fathers." And he hides
   himself, till God says, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" Now if
   Elijah, the most iron saint of ancient times, felt the result of human
   weakness, much more might we expect it of David. So that again I say,
   we are not to judge him too severely, unless we feel prepared with the
   same measure that we mete to him to mete out to ourselves.

   But there was another reason we are not to excuse David. He sinned, and
   that not merely through infirmity, but through evil of heart. It seems
   to us that David had put off prayer. In every other action of David's
   you find some hint that he asked counsel of the Lord. He says to
   Abiathar, "Bring here the ephod." And he enters upon no enterprise
   without first asking of the Urim and Thummim what was God's mind. But
   this time what did he talk with? Why, with the most deceitful thing
   that he could have found--with his own heart, for "the heart is
   deceitful above all things and desperately wicked."

   I do not find that he mentioned it to God's priest. He did not make it
   a matter of prayer. He could not venture to pray when he undertook it
   himself. No, he acted on his own head and a man will soon find that
   head is full of addled brains that can judge without appealing to God.
   Having restrained prayer, he did the foolish act. He forgot his God, he
   looked only at his enemy--and it was no wonder that when he saw the
   force and strength of the cruel monarch and the perseverance of Saul's
   persecution--that he said, "I shall one day fall before him."

   Brothers and Sisters, would you wish to hatch the egg of unbelief till
   it turns into a serpent? Put off prayer! Would you see evils magnified
   and mercies diminished? Would you find your tribulations increased
   sevenfold and your faith diminished in proportion? Put off prayer! I
   say unto you this day, if you will neglect your closet, all the
   troubles you have ever had shall be as nothing compared with what will
   yet come upon you. The little finger of your future doubts shall be
   thicker than the loins of your present mental anguish. You shall know
   what man can do when he leaves his God and you shall find out in the
   bitterness of your soul what an evil thing it is to leave the living
   fountain and hew out to yourself a broken cistern which can hold no
   water.

   I have thus, I think, as well as may be, opened up the causes of
   David's unbelief. Some of them will hit your case, my Brothers and
   Sisters. You may find some portion here. Well, if you find out the
   cause, remember that the remedy lies somewhere near it. If a forgotten
   closet will make you weep, a frequented closet will make you smile. If
   the excitement of delight has been followed by depression, that
   excitement itself, if you seek it again, will be the best cure. And
   finally, your mind, made strong to endure these blessed excitements,
   shall be sweetly strengthened for the bliss of Heaven and on earth you
   shall be capable of enjoying the Heaven which some of the saints have
   known before they crossed the stream of death.

   III. But I must hasten on, for my failing voice tells me I must soon
   conclude. But not until we have discharged, briefly, the third
   point--WHAT WERE THE ILL EFFECTS OF DAVID'S UNBELIEF?

   It strikes me that this was one of the sins to which David referred,
   when he asked God to forgive the sins of his youth and his former
   transgressions. We have looked so often at his sin with Bathsheba that
   we have been apt to think he had no other faults. Whereas, one must say
   it--the life of David for some few months after this exclamation was
   sad. And one might wish it could be blotted out. It was sad, sad,
   indeed. But we will talk of these matters in detail, though briefly.

   What did his unbelief make him do first? It made him do a foolish
   thing, the same foolish thing which he had rued once before. Now, we
   say a burnt child always dreads the fire. But David had been burnt and
   yet, in his unbelief, he puts his hand into the same fire again. He
   went once to Achish, king of Gath, and the Philistines said, "This is
   that David of whom they said, 'Saul has slain his thousands and David
   his ten thousands.' " And David was greatly afraid and "feigned himself
   mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his
   spittle fall down upon his beard," (which to the Eastern was the surest
   sign of his being mad if he despised his beard).

   And they drove him away, for Achish said, "Why, then, have you brought
   him to me? Have I need of mad men, that you have brought this fellow to
   play the mad man in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"
   Now, he goes to the same Achish again! Yes, and mark you, my Brethren,
   although you and I know the bitterness of sin, yet if we are left to
   our own unbelief, we shall fall into the same sin again. I know we have
   said, "No! Never, never. I know so much by experience what an awful
   thing this is." Your experience is not worth a rush to you apart from
   the continual restraints of Divine Grace.

   If your faith fails, everything else goes down with it. And you, you
   gray-headed professor, will be as big a fool as a very boy, if God lets
   you alone. In fact, I must say it, reverencing as I do the hoary head,
   that of all fools in the world, old fools are the worst. I have seen
   more falls among aged Christians than among any other sort, till one
   has been apt to pray, "Lord, save those who are in the slippery paths
   of old age." I have often said there is no Scriptural example of a
   young man falling into any gross, great sin.

   All the Scriptural examples are quite the other way, and think I might
   say, as the pastor of this Church, that the most sorrowful cases of
   excommunication we have ever had have been about men who had some gray
   hair on their heads, or were fathers of families. Far oftener than
   about the young. The reason being, I think, this--that often the old
   saint begins to rely on his past experiences--and if he does so it is
   all over with him. For we are just as much fools after seventy years'
   spiritual education, as we were when we first entered into the
   school--if the Lord leaves us to ourselves.

   We do grow. We do learn, the Lord being with us. But if we are left, we
   are no stronger after we have been established in the faith, than we
   were before. I say again, if we were left at any moment, no matter who
   we may be, sin would soon be our pursuit, and iniquity our companion.
   We must offer the same prayer, "Hold You me up and I shall be safe," to
   the very end of the chapter, and we must finish our lives just as David
   finished the 119th Psalm with that confession, "I have gone astray like
   a lost sheep; seek your servant, for I do not forget Your
   commandments."

   But next--for the beginning of sin is like the letting out of water and
   we go from bad to worse, he went over to the Lord's enemies. Would you
   have believed it--he that killed Goliath sought refuge in Goliath's
   land! He who smote the Philistines trusts in the Philistines! No. More.
   He who was Israel's champion, becomes the chamberlain to Achish, for
   Achish said, "Therefore will I make you keeper of my head forever," and
   David became the captain of the bodyguard of the King of Philistia and
   helped to preserve the life of one who was the enemy of God's Israel.

   Ah, if we doubt God, we shall soon be numbered among God's foes.
   Inconsistency will win us over into the ranks of His enemies and they
   will be saying, "Why are these Hebrews here?" And the question will be
   passed round from man to man, "Is not this David of whom they said,
   'Saul has slain his thousands but David his ten thousands?' What is
   David doing here?" Brother, if, "Pride goes before destruction and a
   haughty spirit before a fall," I may, without wresting Scripture, say,
   "Unbelief goes before destruction and a doubting spirit before a fall,"
   for so it is. "The joy of the Lord is your strength." "The just shall
   live by faith, but if any man turn back, My soul shall have no pleasure
   in him"--the two sentences put together as if the failure of our faith
   would surely lead to a turning back to sin.

   Have patience with me while I notice once again that not only thus did
   David become numbered with God's enemies but that he actually went into
   open sin. You will read this chapter and the next and the next, at your
   leisure--and you will perhaps have leisure this afternoon. It will keep
   you from talking about ministers and about a great many other things
   that are just as well let alone on Sunday afternoons. For that is the
   general gossip of Sunday afternoon--"Did you ever hear Mr. So-and-So
   and Mr. So-and-So?"--ministers being thought a subject useful for
   Sundays--that is to say, the pulling of them to pieces.

   However, if instead of that, you will read those chapters, you will be
   profited. David did two very evil things. He acted the part of a liar
   and deceiver. Harsh words, you will say, to use of David. But they are
   not too harsh. He went out and slew the Geshurites, and sundry other
   tribes, and this he did often. When he came back, Achish asked him
   where he had been and he said he had been to the south of Judah--that
   is to say, he made Achish believe that his incursions were made against
   his own people, instead of being made against the allies of Philistia.

   This he kept up for a long time. And then, as one sin never goes
   without a companion, for the devil's hounds always hunt in couples, he
   was guilty of bloodshed, for into whatever town he went, he put all the
   inhabitants to death. He spared neither man, nor woman, nor child, lest
   they should tell the king of Philistia where he had been. So that one
   sin led him on to another. And this is a very sorrowful part of David's
   life. He that believes God and acts in faith, acts with dignity, and
   other men will stoop before him and pay him reverence. But he who
   disbelieves his God and begins to act in his own carnal wisdom, will
   soon be this and that and the other and the enemy will say, "Aha, aha,
   so would we have it." While the godly will say, "How are the mighty
   fallen! How has the strong man been given up unto his adversary!" O
   that God the Holy Spirit may preserve our faith in God our Father and
   the Lord Jesus Christ, that so we may be preserved without spot until
   the day of His appearing!

   Furthermore, not only was David guilty of all this, but he was on the
   verge of being guilty of still worse sin--of overt acts of warfare
   against the Lord's people. For David, having become the friend of
   Achish, when Achish went to battle against Israel, he said to him,
   "Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me to battle, you and
   your men." And David professed his willingness to go. We believe it was
   only a feigned willingness. But then, you see, we convict him again of
   falsehood. The day comes when a decisive battle is to be fought and the
   lords of the Philistines go on before Achish.

   "Where is David?" "Oh, David is with king Achish in the rear-guard,"
   for the king had made him captain of his lifeguard. He was thus raised
   to a very high position, the companion of Achish, at his right
   hand--the commander of the men who were to protect the king in case of
   danger. Now, there is David, and he is going up against his own people,
   to fight against his own king, to do mischief against God's own chosen
   land. It is true that God interposed and prevented it. But this was no
   credit to David, for you know, Brethren, we are guilty of a sin, even
   if we do not commit it, if we are willing to commit it.

   And so was it in this case--we are sorry to have to say it, even when
   the lords of the Philistines interposed and said, "Make this fellow
   return, that he may go again to his place which you have appointed him
   and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an
   adversary to us. And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? And
   what have you found in your servant so long as I have been with you
   unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord
   the king?" David was still professing a kind of unwillingness to
   depart, while God knows he was glad enough to get off so evil an
   errand. What a mercy it is we have some enemies, for God makes our
   enemies often our best friends.

   I forget who it is, but I think it is old Bishop Hall, in his
   meditations, who says, "When the Lord's people have a deadly cancer,
   there are many of their friends who are too dainty to let the lances in
   but their foes will do it out of spite, and then they get cured
   thereby. For often does the Lord let our enemies pierce us in some sore
   which would have gathered and destroyed us, if it had not been that
   their cruel wound becomes life to us from the dead." So these lords of
   the Philistines were David's best friends.

   To conclude. The last effect of David's sin--and here it blessedly came
   to close--was this--it brought him into great trial. Let me tell the
   story briefly, and I have done. While David was away with king Achish,
   the Amalekites invaded the south and attacked Ziklag, which was David's
   town. For some reason or other they did not put to death any of the
   inhabitants, but they took away the whole of the men, the few who were
   left, the women and children, all their household goods and stuff and
   treasures. They took away all. And when David came back to Ziklag,
   there were the bare walls and empty houses. And Ahinoam and Abigail,
   David's two wives, were gone, and all the mighty men who were with him
   had lost their wives and little ones.

   And as soon as they saw it, they lifted up their voices and wept. It
   was not that they had lost their gold and silver but they had lost
   everything. That exiled band had lost their own flesh and blood, the
   partners of their lives. Then they mutinied against their captain and
   they said, "Let us stone David." And here is David, a penniless beggar,
   a loader deserted by his own men, suspected by them probably of having
   traitorously given up the town to the foe. And then it is written--and
   O how blessed is that line!--"And David encouraged himself in the Lord
   his God."

   Ah, now David is right. Now he has come back to his proper anchorage.
   Blessed afflictions, that drive him back to where he ought to have been
   all the time! Sin and smart go together. The child of God cannot sin
   with impunity. Other men may. You that do not fear God may go and sin
   as you like, and often meet with very little trouble in this world as
   the consequence of it. But a child of God cannot do that. "You only
   have I known of all the nations of the earth, therefore will I punish
   you for your iniquities." And so David had the rod more sharply than he
   had ever had it before, because he had doubted his God.

   And what are we? Many of us believe in Christ. But what are we, if God
   should leave us? Let us heartily join in the prayer, "Lord, increase
   our faith; hold You us up and we shall be safe!"

   As for you who have no faith in Christ, this last word. If temporary
   unbelief is so dreadful, what must habitual unbelief be? "He that
   believes not shall be damned." "He that believes not is condemned
   already, because he believes not." God help you, Unbeliever, to trust
   Jesus. It is life to you. It will be life to you in this world and in
   the world to come. Trust Him with your soul and He will never forsake
   you but to the end He will keep you. And in the end He will bless you
   and without end He will glorify you to be with Himself forever.

   May the Lord bless the words we have uttered and make us faithful, for
   Jesus' sake! Amen.

   "It is Jesus speaks, the sinner's friend,
   Dejected saint, today.
   Lift up your head, nor downward bend,
   But sing your fears away.
   Why do you, like the turtle, grieve?
   Cast all your cares on Me;
   My Grace sufficient is, believe,
   In e very state for you.
   To guard you from ten thousand ills,
   And make your standing sure,
   Sufficient are My shalls and wills,
   That must and shall endure.
   At every time, in everyplace,
   In safeguard you shall be,
   And find My everlasting Grace
   Sufficient still for you.
   Jesus, assist us to believe,
   For slow of heart are we,
   Grace from Your fullness to receive,
   And thus to honor You"

                          Cheer For The Faint-Hearted

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, JANUARY 26 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But his wife said unto him, If the Lord werepleased to kill us, He
   would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our
   hands, neither would He have showed us all these things, nor would as
   at this time have told us such things as these." Judges 13:23.

   FAITH is not only the door by which we enter into the way of salvation,
   as it is written, "He has opened the door of faith unto the gentiles,"
   but it likewise describes the entire path of Christian pilgrimage,
   "that we also walk in the steps of that faith." We are not only
   quickened by faith at the outset of our spiritual career, but we are
   supported and sustained thereby in all our subsequent experience--"the
   just shall live by faith." As it is by faith that we come out from the
   world and begin to tread the heavenly road, so it must be by faith that
   we walk all the journey through.

   Till we lay down this veil of flesh, till the angel of death shall rend
   the curtain and we shall see him face to face, let us not hope to walk
   by sight or sense but only by faith in the living God. A life of faith
   is always very singular--often it seems very foolish to the carnal man.
   The man who acts by faith often acts imprudently in the eyes of the
   world. He appears unbusiness-like, because he observes not the maxims
   of his times, but holds fast by those statutes which God has given us
   for all time.

   Faith and patience often encourage a man to go the very way that
   caution and prudence would tell him not to go. And not infrequently,
   those who are weak in the faith will hold up their hands with
   astonishment, even if they do not speak with some degree of
   indignation, at the daring way in which the man strong in faith
   challenges the promises of God and acts as if he believed them to be
   quite as true as though they were already fulfilled. You know little,
   my Brothers and Sisters, of what it is to walk by faith, if you do not
   find it to be a way that you know not and a path which you have not
   seen.

   We saw the last step not until we had taken it, but the foundation on
   which faith is to put its foot for the next we cannot see. We do, as it
   were, tread on clouds and find them firm. We put our feet on mists and
   find them adamant beneath our feet. Happy is that man who, steadfast,
   upright, cheerful, goes from strength to strength, believing his God!
   Trusting in his God, he knows no care! Resting in his God he knows no
   impossibility!

   But, it seems, from our text, that we have one or two lessons to learn.
   And the first is, that the strongest faith has its seasons of wavering.
   Even Abraham, "the father of the faithful," had his seasons of
   distrust, when expediency rather than integrity prompted him. Most of
   those eminent saints who are mentioned in Scripture as exhibiting faith
   in its greatness, appear to have sometimes showed the white flag of
   unbelief. There may have lived--I will not dare to say to the
   contrary--there may have lived some man who did never once doubt his
   God.

   But I think I have never had the privilege of putting my eyes upon him.
   There may be, and I hope there are, some Christians who through their
   whole career never doubted their interest in Christ and who never had
   to say--

   "It is a point I long to know, Often it causes anxious thought, Do I
   love the Lord or no, Am IHis, or am Inot?"

   But, I must say, I think such Brethren are few. I think you might
   travel far before you should meet with any. God forbid I should speak
   lightly of unbelief! It is the most damnable of sins. God forbid I
   should say a word in its favor, or encourage its propagation. There
   cannot be a greater villainy out of Hell than doubting the promises of
   God.

   There cannot be a greater act of treason than to mistrust the love, the
   faith, the tenderness, the Truth of the God who has helped us up to
   now. But still the confession must be made, humiliating though it
   is--we do know that even those Believers whose hearts are true and
   whose souls are clad in the panoply of Heaven, do sometimes find their
   loins loose and their strength fail them. Mr. Pilgrim thought Mr.
   Great-Heart never had a doubt. And so is it with some of our hearers.
   They fancy that their pastors certainly never have any trials as to
   their union with Christ. They can always read their titles clear.

   Ah, Beloved but if you should ask those men, they might say with
   Elijah, "I am not better than my fathers." There are times when the
   high-soaring eagle droops to the earth, and when he who could scale the
   stars has to lay flat upon his face in dust and ashes, crying, "My God,
   my God, why have you forsaken me?" These reflections are illustrated by
   the narrative of our text. Manoah certainly was strong in faith. He did
   not even see the angel but he believed-- "Blessed is he that has not
   seen and yet has believed"--and when he entreated that he might see the
   angel, there seemed to be more curiosity than wavering in his faith.

   He believed God, and no doubt, settled in his own mind that he would be
   obedient to the heavenly vision. Yet even he begins to entertain
   misgivings when he says, "We shall surely die, for we have seen an
   angel of the Lord." Good Lord! Of what small account are the best of
   men apart from You! How high they go when You lift them up! How low
   they fall if You withdraw Your hand! It is our joy amidst distress when
   You enables us to say, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him."
   But if You take away Your Spirit, we cannot even trust You in the
   brightest day. When storms gather around us, we can laugh at them if
   You are with us. But in the fairest morn that ever glowed on human
   heart, we doubt, and we miscarry if You are not with us still, to
   preserve and strengthen the faith which You have Yourself bestowed.

   Dwelling no longer, however, upon that very humiliating truth, we come
   to make a second observation. We have observed that some of these
   greatest liberations of faith have occurred just after the brightest
   seasons of enjoyment. Some of us have learned to be afraid of joy.
   Sadness is often the herald of satisfaction. But bliss is oftentimes
   the harbinger of pain. Whether it is that God provides for our struggle
   by giving us an extraordinary banquet before a season of long fasting,
   so that like Elijah, we may go forty days in the strength of this
   marvelous meat. Or whether it is that He cures us of the dangers of
   surfeit by sending us on long journeys after we have had high
   feastings, I cannot say, but so it is.

   How strangely is it related of our Lord! He went into the Jordan of His
   Baptism. The Spirit descended upon Him like a dove. The Father's voice
   saluted Him, "You are My Beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased." What
   next? "And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness: and He
   was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan and was with
   the wild beasts."

   John Bunyan, with great wisdom, puts the Palace Beautiful first, and
   then no sooner does Christian get out of the Palace gates, than he
   begins to descend into the Valley of Humiliation. They had given him a
   sword and a shield and a helmet. He had never had those before. Now
   that he had his sword, he found that he had to use it against Apollyon.
   Now that he had his shield, he had to hold it up to catch the fiery
   dart. Now that he had received the weapon of "all prayer," he found
   that he had need of it as he walked through that desperate place, the
   Valley of the Shadow of Death.

   God does not give His people weapons to play with. He does not give
   them strength to spend on their lusts. Lord, if You have given me these
   goodly weapons, it is sure I shall need them in hard fighting. If I
   have had a feast at Your table, I will remember that it is but a short
   walk from the upper chamber to the garden of Gethsemane. Daniel, the
   man greatly beloved, was reduced very low. "All his comeliness was
   turned into corruption and he retained no strength," when God showed
   him "the great vision."

   Thus, too, with favored John, he must be banished to Patmos. In the
   deep solitude of that Aegean sea-girt island he must receive "the
   Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him." I have noticed, in
   the ordinary scenes of Christian experience, that our greatest joys
   come just after some of our sorest trials. When the howling tempest has
   played out its strength, it soothes itself to sleep. Then comes a
   season of calm and quiet, so profound in its stillness, that only the
   monstrous tempest could have been the mother of so mighty a calm. So it
   seems with us.

   Deep waves of trial, high mountains of joy. But the reverse is almost
   as often true--from Pisgah's top we go to our graves. From the top of
   Carmel we have to go down to the dens of lions and fight with the
   leopards. Let us be on our watchtower, lest like Manoah, having seen
   the Angel of God, the next thing should be that we say we shall surely
   die, for we have seen the Lord.

   It seems very plain from our text that it is a very happy thing if,
   when one Believer's down, there is another near to lift him up. In this
   case Manoah found in his wife a helpmeet. It is said by old Master
   Henry Smith that there is many a man who has had his head broken with
   his own rib. But there is many a man who has had his heart cured in the
   same way.

   So, in this case, if wife and husband had both been down at one time,
   they might have been long in getting up. But seeing that when he fell
   she was there, strong in faith, to give him a helping hand, it was but
   a slight fall and they went on their way rejoicing.

   If one shall fall, then his Brother shall help him up. What is the
   lesson here? Why, perhaps some of you have got such strong faith
   tonight that you hardly know what to do with it. What should you do? If
   there was some person fainting in the seat behind you and you had some
   strong smelling salts, you would pass them over. Now sometimes our
   faith is intended to be as a bottle to be put to the nostril of other
   fainting souls. If you are strong, help your weak Brother. If you see
   any bowed down, take them on your shoulders, help to carry them. Does
   not your Master carry the lambs in His bosom? Imitate Him and sometimes
   carry a lamb in your bosom, too.

   It is a Divine thing to wipe tears from all eyes--perhaps your faith is
   meant to be a handkerchief with which you may wipe away the tears of
   your Brother. But you say, "Where are the ones low in faith just now?"
   Wife, perhaps it is your husband! Husband, perhaps it is your wife! It
   may be, daughter, your aged mother. Brother, may be it is your brother?
   Perhaps the very person who sits next to you in the pew, who may be at
   this time saying, "I walk in darkness and I see no light." Speak, speak
   wisely, fervently, affectionately, out of the fullness of your soul,
   and who can tell?

   He who said twice, "Comfort you, comfort you, My people; speak you
   comfortably unto Jerusalem," may make you to be a Barnabas, a son of
   Consolation to those who are weary and ready to die. Is it not the duty
   of Christians to strengthen the weak hands and to confirm the feeble
   knees? Do not follow the way of the world. It is always, if a man is
   going down, "Down with him. The moment he begins to reel, give him a
   push. Send him over at once." And it is so with some coarse-minded
   professors. If they see a Brother a little faint, they tell him
   something frightful--something about the dragons and the lions, or the
   giants that are in the road.

   Instead of that, my Brother, help to prop up your reeling friend for a
   little season and it may be that in some brighter day with him, when
   your dark hour shall come, he will repay with a mighty interest the
   little cheer which you give him today. It is a good thing, however, to
   temper kindness with wisdom. You know Manoah's wife did not say, when
   she found that she knew more than her husband did, "Why how silly you
   must be! What a stupid man to be frightened like this!" She did not
   begin, as I know some Christians would do who are stronger in faith
   than the weak ones, by scolding about the matter--but no, she used soft
   liniment for smarting wounds.

   She knew that it does not do to put stinging nettles to a cut, and
   therefore she put soft salve where there had been a very deep wound.
   Let us do the same. It is time to talk of duty to a Brother when you
   get him out of the ditch. But when you see a man down, I would hardly
   talk to him about the sin of tumbling in, but pull him out first and
   brush him clean. Then afterwards tell him to take heed that he fall not
   there again. I have sometimes had lessons given me about unbelief, when
   they were not, I think, very profitable. There should be a timeliness
   about our advice, and if we see a man in Manoah's plight, afraid of
   dying, we should use the discretion of Manoah's wife and encourage and
   cheer his heart.

   The text seems to me to suggest certain consolations which ought to be
   laid hold of by Believers in Christ in their time of sore trouble. Let
   me speak to any Christian present tonight who has a trouble--we will
   suppose it temporal trouble.

   "These are hard times!" Times have always been hard ever since I
   remember them, and I suppose they ever will be, for they used to be
   hard in our grandfathers' days and there seems to be no likelihood but
   what they will continue to be so. Yet we always talk of "the good old
   times," and when our children succeed us, they will speak about our
   times as being "the good old times," too. The fact is, the present time
   is the best time that ever was, and "now" is the only time that belongs
   to us, for the past is gone and the future is not come. The present is
   what we have got in hand. Let us make the right use of it.

   But you have had losses and crosses and disappointments. You are
   chastened every morning and you are troubled all day long. Satan
   whispered to you last Saturday night, when you were putting up the
   shutters and as tired as you could be, "It is no use going to the House
   of God tomorrow. There is nothing there for you. God has been troubling
   you all week. He means to destroy you. He is going to give you up--you
   may do what you will but the current is too strong. You may tug and
   pull, but you will starve, for all that. God has forsaken you, and your
   enemies are persecuting you on every side."

   Well, now, it would be a very curious thing if it were true. But it is
   not true, for the reasons which Manoah's wife gave. Remember, first,
   the Lord has in your case accepted a burnt offering and a meat offering
   at your hand. You know that when your faith laid hold of Christ, God
   did not spurn the sacrifice you brought. When you said, for the first
   time in your life--

   "My faith does lay her hand On that dear head of Yours, While like a
   penitent I stand, And here confess my sin,"

   He did not reject the offering which you then presented to Him, but He
   spoke with a loving voice and said, "Go and sin no more. Your sins,
   which are many, are all forgiven you."

   Since that time you have brought the meat offering of your prayers and
   they have been heard--you have had answers of peace. In looking back
   upon the past, you can remember many times and seasons when God has
   especially answered you as though He would rend the heavens and put out
   His right hand full of the mercies which you needed. Now, would the
   Lord have heard you? Above all, would He have accepted Christ for you?
   Would He have accepted your faith and saved you in Christ, if He had
   meant to destroy you?

   What? Can you trust Him with your soul and not trust Him with your
   shop? Can you leave eternity with Him and not time? What? Trust the
   immortal Spirit and not this poor decaying, moldering, flesh and blood?
   Man! Shame on you! If the Lord had meant you to die, He would not have
   accepted the offering at your hand. But, you say, He will forsake you
   in this trouble. Remember what things He has shown to you. See how
   Manoah's wife said, "Would He have shown us such things as these?" Why,
   what has your past life been? Has not it been a wonder?

   You have been in as bad a plight as you are in tonight scores of
   times--and you have got out of it. "There is a big wave coming over my
   head." Yes, but there have been fifty waves as big as that which have
   passed over your head without drowning you, and this will not, either.
   "It is a deep river I have to ford." Ah, but you have waded through as
   deep streams as that and you have not been drowned. Besides, remember
   how He showed you His love in a strange city and His faithfulness,
   perhaps, in a far-off land.

   When there was none to comfort you and none to help you, His own right
   hand defended you and His right hand brought salvation to you. I can
   say joyfully and cheerfully--

   "When trouble like a gloomy cloud,
   Has gathered thick and thundered loud,
   He, near my side, has always stood,
   His loving kindness, O how good!" And I often think myself the biggest
   fool in the world for ever daring to doubt my God again after such
   singular interpositions both of Providence and Divine Grace as you and
   I have seen in this Church and in the midst of this congregation. If He
   had meant to destroy us, would He have shown us such things as we have
   seen? After such kindness in the past, will He let us sink at last? God
   forbid!
   Besides this, Manaoh's wife gave a third reason, "Nor would He at this
   time have told us such things as these." She meant that He would not
   have given them such prophecies of the future as He had done, if He
   meant to kill them. It stood to reason, she seemed to say, "If I am to
   bear a son, we are not going to die."

   And so, remember, God has made one or two promises which are true and
   if they are true, it stands to reason He won't leave you. Let us have
   one of them. "No good thing will I withhold from them that walk
   uprightly." Then, as you are to have every good thing, you must have
   it. It is absolutely certain that God is not going to leave you without
   good things now.

   Or take another, "When you go through the rivers I will be with you and
   through the floods, they shall not overflow you." Mark that! It is
   certain that God will not permit the floods to overflow you. Then it
   stands to reason that you cannot be drowned. It is a good thing for a
   Christian who is much tried in business to carry his check book in his
   pocket but mark what kind of check book I mean. Get a copy of "Clarke's
   Precious Promises." They are the promises collated from Scripture put
   under the different heads.

   I generally have kept a copy in my pocket, so that when I have had a
   trouble of a particular sort, I could turn to the head under which my
   trouble would come. And I never turned there without finding a promise
   to meet it. Or whenever your trial comes, go home to your Bible, open
   it, ask the Lord to direct you, and with a little search I think you
   will soon find a promise that was made on purpose for you. It may have
   suited twenty cases before, but you can only say if an angel had come
   down from Heaven to bring a message precisely adapted to your peculiar
   trial, it could not have been better worded! The arrow could not have
   hit the center of the mark more surely than it has.

   Well, then, if the Lord had meant to destroy you, would He have given
   you that promise? Would He thus have deluded you? Oh, this is far from
   Him! Let the fact that He has accepted Christ for you, that He has
   already shown you so much favor, and that He has given you such
   precious promises, let these, I say, lead you to think that He will not
   destroy you, He will not leave you.

   But we will suppose for a moment, in the next place, that you are in
   some spiritual trouble. "Oh," you say, "this is worse than temporal
   trial," and indeed, it is. Touch a man in his house and he can bear it.
   Touch him in his children and he may bear that. But touch him in his
   bone and in his flesh, no, go farther, touch him in his soul and in his
   faith--and then it is hard to lay hold on God and trust Him still. The
   enemy had thrust sore at Manoah to vex him and make him fret.

   There may be some here whose spiritual enemy has set upon them
   dreadfully of late and he has been howling in your ears, "It's all over
   with you! You are cast off, God has rejected you! You are twice dead,
   plucked up by the roots--you are wandering stars, you are clouds
   without rain, you are one of those that knew the way of righteousness
   but have turned away from it--you have gone back to your old sin. God
   has cursed you! Like Esau, He has rejected you. You have sold your
   portion for a mess of pottage and you are cast out forever."

   No, Soul--thus says the Lord to you--"Was there not a time when Christ
   was precious to you?" O back-slider, was there not a season when you
   could put your finger into the prints of the nails and your hand into
   His side? Poor fallen soul, was there not a period when that precious
   hymn of Toplady's was sweet to your ears?--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring, Simply to Your Cross I cling. Naked, look
   to You for dress, Helpless, come to You for Grace. Black I to the
   fountain fly, Wash me, Savior, or I die."

   Then I tell you, Soul, if the Lord had ever meant to destroy you, He
   would never have permitted you to know a precious Christ, or to put
   your trust in Him. Besides, fallen though you now are, through sore
   travail, yet was there not a time when you saw the beauty of God in His
   temple? I went to the House of God with the company that kept holy day.
   His name to me was as ointment poured forth. My soul delighted herself
   in her God and my spirit made her boast in her King. O Jesus, once You
   were very sweet to me. I knew the plague of my own heart even then, but
   I knew Your power to save, I knew the fellowship of the Father and of
   His Son Jesus Christ--

   "What peaceful hours I then enjoyed,
   How sweet their memory still!
   But they have left an aching void,
   The world can never fill."

   Our Soul! What a mercy it is that the world cannot fill it, and what a
   greater mercy still, that God will fill it, for He never emptied a soul
   He did not mean to fill. He never stripped a man He did not mean to
   clothe. He never made one a spiritual beggar without intending to make
   Him spiritually rich. And if you, tonight, are brought to the first
   stage of desperation, you are brought to the first stage of hope. Now
   that man comes to his wit's end, God shall begin to magnify His mercy
   and His Truth.

   To conclude the argument of Manaoh's wife, what promises God has made
   even to you! What has He said of His people? "I will surely bring them
   in." "I give unto My sheep eternal life and they shall never perish,
   neither shall any pluck them out of My hand." And what does Christ say
   again?--"Father, I will that they also, whom You have given Me, be with
   Me where I am." But turn to that Book for yourself. See the promises
   made to the soul that ever did believe in Christ, and you may say, once
   and for all, "If He had meant to destroy me, He would not have made
   such promises as these. If He meant to desert me in spiritual trouble
   He would never have brought me this far."

   To the Christian who is near his death, I commend this text. To the
   gray-headed tottering saint. To the consumptive girl, whose cheeks
   betray the worm within. To you who are going down the steep decline and
   whose feet begin to chill with the waters of the black river. He has
   accepted Christ at your hands, be not afraid to die. He has showed you
   the riches of His faithfulness up to now--trust Him for the rest. He is
   engaged by Covenant, yes, by the blood of the Everlasting Covenant, to
   bring you to Heaven. Do not doubt, but boldly ford the stream, for in
   its deepest parts you shall feel the bottom. Thus boldly live and
   boldly dare to die, for when you go through the valley of the shadow of
   death, He will be with you, His rod and His staff shall comfort you.

   Now it may happen tonight that I have some young Christians here, who
   have only during the last week or two been converted to God, and they
   have been falling during the last two or three days into the Slough of
   Despond. I hope this sermon may help them out, for of you is it true
   that if you have laid hold of Christ, He would not have enabled you to
   do that, if He meant to leave you. If you have been shown the evil of
   your own heart, He would not have shown you that if He meant to destroy
   you. And if He has caused you to lean upon any promise, depend upon it
   He will give you that promise and fulfill it in your experience. He
   will save you.

   I think about five days after I first found Christ, when my joy had
   been such that I could have danced for very mirth at the thought that
   Christ was mine, on a sudden I fell into a sad fit of despondency. I
   will tell you why. When I first believed in Christ, I am not sure that
   I thought the devil was dead but certainly I had a kind of notion that
   he was so mortally wounded he could not disturb me. And then I
   certainly fancied that the corruption of my nature had received its
   death blow. I read what Cowper said--

   "Since the dear hour that brought me to Your foot, And cut up all my
   follies by the root."

   And I really thought that Cowper knew what he was saying--but never did
   any poet blunder so terribly as Cowper did when he said that, for no
   man, I think, has got his follies cut up by the roots yet. However, I
   fondly dreamed mine were. I felt persuaded that they would never sprout
   again. I was going to be perfect--I fully calculated upon it--and lo, I
   found an intruder I had not reckoned upon--an evil heart of unbelief in
   departing from the living God.

   So I went to that same Primitive Methodist Chapel where I first
   received peace with God, through the simple preaching of the Word. The
   text happened to be, "Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me
   from the body of this death?" "There," I thought "that's a text for
   me." I had got as far as that--in the middle of that very
   sentiment--when the minister began by saying, "Paul was not a Believer
   when he said this."

   Well now, I knew I was a Believer, and it seemed to me from the context
   that Paul must have been a Believer, too. Now I am sure he was. The man
   went on to say that no child of God ever did feel any conflict within.
   So I took up my hat and left the place and I do not think I have
   frequented such places since. They are very good for people who are
   unconverted to go to, but of very little use for children of God. That
   is my notion of Methodism. It is a noble thing to bring in strangers.
   But a terrible thing for those that are brought in to sit and feed
   there.

   It is like the parish pound, it is a good thing to put sheep in when
   they are strayed but there is no food inside. They had better be let
   out as soon as possible to find real food for the soul. I knew that
   that man understood nothing of experimental divinity, or of practical
   heart theology, or else he would not have talked so. A good man he was,
   I do not doubt, but utterly incompetent to the task of dealing with a
   case like that.

   Then we say to you tonight, who are in such a case, we are not at all
   surprised. This is just where God's people generally come soon after
   conversion. If they get over that Slough of Despond, they may go on
   merrily for a long way-- years, perhaps--certainly for whole miles. As
   Mr. Bunyan says that, when Christian got out of that Slough, he went
   for a long distance along a high road within walls--called the Walls of
   Salvation--and so it is. Once get over that, that first season of
   spiritual depression, which is partly caused by the excessive
   exhilaration of our mental frame after conversion, and we shall go on
   readily enough, rejoicing in God.

   Be not troubled, young Christian, about this matter. Go you again to
   Christ--put your trust in Him anew. Go once more as a poor lost sinner
   and take Jesus to be your All in All. Cast yourself flat on your face
   again before His Cross. Go and wash anew in the fountain filled with
   His blood. Let your Betrothed come over again, and then the joy of your
   salvation shall come again. And so, God keep you and God bless you,
   that the Evil One touch you not.

   "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved. He that believes not
   shall he damned." Believe, then, on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
   he saved and your house. May God give His blessing for the Savior's
   sake! Amen.

                          The Elders Before The Throne

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 23, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And round about the Throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the
   seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment.
   And they had on their heads crowns of gold." The four and twenty elders
   fall down before Him that sat on the Throne and worship Him that lives
   forever and ever and cast their crowns before the Throne, saying, You
   are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for You have
   created all things, and for Your pleasure they are and were created."

   Revelation 4:4; 10,11.

   THE universe of God is one--Heaven and earth are not so separate as
   unbelief has dreamed. As the Lord has but one family, written in one
   register, redeemed with one blood, quickened by one Spirit, so this
   whole household abides in one habitation evermore. We who are in the
   body abide in the lower room which is sometimes dark and cold but bears
   sufficient marks that it is a room in God's house. For it is to the eye
   of our faith often lit up with heavenly luster and we, even we, while
   we are yet here, are by blessed earnests made partakers of the
   inheritance of the saints in light.

   It is the same house, I say, but ours is the lower room, while our
   glorified Brethren are up there, in the upper story, where the sunlight
   streams in everlastingly, where no chilling winds or poisonous breath
   can ever reach. It was well said that God's great house seems to have
   two wings. The one was a hospital and the other a palace. We are as yet
   in the wing on the left hand side, which is the hospital. We came into
   it sick even unto death, leprous to our very core, polluted from head
   to foot, having no soundness in us anywhere.

   And in this hospital we are undergoing the process of cure--a cure
   which is already certain, which is soon to be perfected. And then we
   shall pass from the hospital, the lazar-house, into the palace, where
   "without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing," we shall be recognized as
   the aristocracy of God, princes of the blood--royal of the universe.
   Sons of God and joint-heirs with Christ Jesus. Still is it but one
   building--one roof covers the whole, both lazar-house and palace-- one
   family, we dwell in it--one Church, above, beneath, though now divided
   by the narrow partition of death.

   Now, to a great extent there is a likeness between the lower room and
   the upper room. As on earth we prepare for Heaven, so the state of the
   saints on earth is Heaven foreshadowed. In many respects the condition
   of the child of God on earth is a type of his condition in Heaven. And
   I may say without fear of question that what the character of the
   saints is above, that should be the character of the saints below. We
   may very safely take for our example those glorified spirits. We need
   not be afraid that we shall be led astray by imitating them, by
   learning their occupations, or by attempting to share their joys.
   Surely the things in Heaven are patterns of the things on earth and as
   they are before the Throne of God so ought we to be, and so shall we be
   in proportion as we live up to our privileges and receive the likeness
   and image of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Brethren, it is upon this subject that I want to speak this morning.
   God is making Heaven very near to us. We are now so large a Church that
   according to the laws of mortality, we lose five or six every month by
   death, and frequently two or three are removed in a week. We can hardly
   hope to meet together upon a single Sunday without hearing that another
   of the stars is set. Some little time ago we went to the grave with an
   excellent elder of our Church, who had long known the Master and had
   served Him well--and now, during the coming week, it will be our lot to
   perform the same mournful office for another Brother who has been in
   Christ, I suppose, these forty or fifty years, and who has served this
   Church for some little time with industry and zeal--but this week has
   been removed from our midst to join "the general assembly and Church of
   the first-born whose names are written in Heaven."

   The veil grows thinner and thinner, and our faith in the unseen grows
   stronger. As the advanced guard of the army wades through the stream,
   and we hear their triumphant shouts upon the other shore, this world
   fades away and that better land stands out in stronger and more
   glorious reality than it did before. Come, let us talk to one another
   by the way, this morning, of that better land and let us encourage each
   other's hearts to make ourselves through God such as they are who sit
   upon their thrones and to make this land, through the Spirit, such as
   that land is where God sheds His light forever.

   With regard to the spirits before the Throne of God, we shall have
   three things to say this morning. First, a little concerning their
   state and enjoyments. Then, further, concerning their occupations and
   spirit. And a few words with regard to their testimony and precepts to
   us, as, speaking from the upper spheres, they urge us to follow their
   example.

   I. First, then, Brethren with regard to THE STATE AND ENJOYMENTS OF THE
   SPIRITS BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD. In John's vision, you perceive that
   the Church of Christ is represented by the four and twenty elders who
   sat round the Throne of God. We are to look upon them as being the
   representatives of the great body of the faithful gathered to their
   eternal rest.

   Mark, then, in the first place, that the saints in Heaven are
   represented as "elders," which we take to refer not merely to the
   office of the eldership, as it is exercised among us, although it seems
   most fitting that the officers should be the representatives of the
   whole body--but the reference is rather to the fullness of growth of
   Believers before the Throne of God. Here we have elders and those who
   are elders in office should be chosen, because they have had spiritual
   experience, are well taught in the things of the kingdom of Heaven and
   are, therefore, elders by Divine Grace as well as elders by office.

   But in all our Churches we have many who are babes in Christ, who as
   yet can only receive the elements of the Gospel. We have many others
   who are young men, strong but not matured. They have the vigor of
   manhood but they have not yet the ripeness of advanced age. The elders
   in the Church are those who, by reason of years, have had their senses
   exercised. They are not the saplings of the forest but the well-rooted
   trees. They are not the blades of corn springing up, but the full corn
   in the ear awaiting the reaper's sickle. Such are the saints before the
   Throne of God.

   They have made wondrous strides in knowledge. They understand now the
   heights and depths, the lengths and breadths of the love of Christ,
   which still surpasses even their knowledge. The mean, if there are such
   differences, the mean of the glorified understands more of the things
   of God than the greatest Divine on earth. The rending of the veil of
   death is the removal of much of our ignorance. It may be that the
   saints in Heaven progress in knowledge--that is possi-ble--but it is
   certain that at the time of their departure they made a wondrous
   spring.

   They are babes no longer. They are children and infant beginners no
   more. God teaches them in one five minutes, by a sight of the face of
   Jesus, more than they could have learned in threescore years and ten
   while present in the body and absent from the Lord. Their heresies are
   all cleared away with their sins. Their mistakes are all removed. The
   same hand which wipes away all tears from their eyes wipes away all
   specks from their eyes, too. Then they become sound in doctrine,
   skillful in teaching. They become masters in Israel by the sudden
   infusion of the wisdom of God by the Holy Spirit. They are "elders"
   before the Throne of God. They are not unripe corn gathered green and
   damp--they are all fully ripe and they come to the garner as shocks of
   corn come in their season.

   Perhaps they are represented as elders to show the dignity and gravity
   which shall surround saints of God in Heaven. We sometimes hear
   complaints made about the younger members of Churches, that they are
   somewhat light in their conversation. Well, this has always been the
   fault of young people and, as I said the other day, when one
   complained, I could not make lambs into sheep--and while they were
   lambs I suppose they would show some playfulness. It seems to be the
   natural failing of young people to be overflowing with mirth and
   sometimes overtaken with levity.

   But there is a gravity which is very becoming in Christians and there
   is a solidity which is extremely comely in the young Believer. And I
   think when we make a profession of our faith in Christ, though we are
   not to cast away our cheerful faces but to be more happy than ever we
   were before, yet we must put away all unseemly levity and walk as those
   who are looking for the coming of the Son of Man, hearing this voice in
   our ears, "What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy
   conversation and godliness!"

   Now that fault can never be brought against the Church of God before
   the Throne. There they are elders, glorious, blissful, happy--but yet
   serene and majestic in their joy. Theirs is not the prattling joy of
   the child, but the deep silent bliss of the full-grown man. As the
   senators in the Roman senate sat down in solemn grandeur, so that even
   the barbarians were overawed by their majesty bearing, so let our
   holier tranquility and joyful serenity cast an influence over the foes
   of our religion.

   Look upwards, Christians. There are the elders before the Throne of
   God, representatives of what you and I, and all of us who trust in
   Christ, shall soon be. Let us be laying aside childish things. Let us
   be getting ready for the elders' dignity. Let us leave the toy, the
   trifle, the plaything, to those who know not the immortal manhood of
   Believers and let us go on unto perfection, growing in Divine Grace and
   in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

   In passing, I may observe that the number of four and twenty is
   somewhat puzzling. There have been different attempts made to account
   for it. They say that this was the number of the Sanhedrim. But that is
   not clear. Others think that as the number twelve was the symbol of the
   Jewish Church, in the twelve tribes, so twelve more may have been added
   to represent the accession of the Gentile Church. Or it may show the
   multiplication of the Church, that though small, so that it is numbered
   by twelve, its number, while still definite and complete, is now larger
   than it was before.

   But, still better, I think, as there were twenty-four courses of
   Levites, who were porters at the gate of the temple and twenty-four
   courses of priests who offered sacrifice, so the number twenty-four is
   made use of to show that the service of God in His temple is
   complete--that there are as many as will be wanted--that every part of
   the Divine service will be taken up and around that altar which smokes
   before God eternally, there shall be a full complement of those who
   shall bow before Him and do Him homage.

   2. But, secondly, you will notice that these elders are said to be
   around the Throne. We suppose, as near as we can catch the thought of
   John, sitting in a semi-circle, as the Jewish Sanhedrim did around the
   Prince of Israel. It is a somewhat singular thing that in the passage
   in Canticles, where Solomon sings of the king sitting at his table, the
   Hebrew has it "a round table." From this, some expositors, I think
   without straining the text, have said, "There is an equality among the
   saints." In Heaven they are not some sitting at the head and some
   sitting lower down but there is an equality in the position and
   condition of glorified spirits.

   Certainly that idea is conveyed by the position of the four and twenty
   elders. We do not find one of them nearer than the other, but they all
   sat round about the Throne. We believe, then, that the condition of
   glorified spirits in Heaven, is that of nearness to Christ, clear
   vision of His glory, constant access to His court and familiar
   fellowship with His Person. Nor do we think that there is any
   difference before the Throne of God between one saint and another. We
   believe that all the people of God, Apostles, martyrs, ministers, or
   private and obscure Christians, shall all have the same place near the
   Throne, where they shall forever gaze upon their exalted Lord and
   forever be satisfied in His love.

   There shall not be some at a distance, far away in the remote streets
   of the Celestial City and others in the broad thoroughfares. There
   shall not be some near the center and others far away on the verge of
   the wide circumference. But they shall all be near to Christ, all
   ravished with His love, all eating and drinking at the same table with
   Him, all equally His favorites and His friends.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, as we bade you imitate the saints in their
   eldership and perfection, so would we exhort you to imitate them in
   their nearness to Christ. Oh, let us be on earth as the elders are in
   Heaven, sitting round about the Throne of God. May Christ be the center
   of this Church! May He be the center of your thoughts, the center of
   your life. If an angel should fly across this assembly this morning,
   when he came back to Heaven, could he say, "I saw them in the House of
   God, sitting around the Throne. Their eyes were gazing on the
   slaughtered Lamb. Their hearts were loving and praising Him. They were
   desiring to do Him homage and to pay Him reverence"?

   And what do you think of tomorrow and the other days of the week? Will
   it be true of you that you are sitting before the Throne of God?
   Brothers and Sisters, we are out of our proper place when we are
   looking after anything but Christ. "We are not our own. We are bought
   with a price." Why live as if we were our own? He is our Husband, our
   soul is espoused to Him. Oh, how can we live at such a distance from
   Him? He is our life. He makes us live, He makes us blessed-- how can we
   be so much forgetful of Him? How can our hearts be such strangers to
   their Beloved?

   Jesus! Draw us nearer to Yourself! Oh to be nearer to Your Throne,
   Lord, even while we are here! O take us up to You, or else come down to
   us. Say unto us, "Abide in Me and I in you." And permit our souls to
   say, "His left hand is under my head and His right hand does embrace
   me."--

   "Abide with me from morn till eve, For without You I cannot live. Abide
   with me when night is nigh, For without You I dare not die."

   3. A third point of likeness strikes us at once. It seems that the
   elders sitting around the Throne were represented to the illuminated
   eye of John as "clothed in white raiment." Not in raiment of party
   colors, where there were some spots and yet some signs of whiteness.
   They are without fault before the Throne of God. They have "washed
   their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb," and the
   Spirit of God also has so thoroughly renewed them, that they are
   "without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing."

   They have been presented holy and unblameable before the Throne of God.
   Brothers and Sisters, in this, too, they are an example to us. Oh that
   the Spirit of God might keep the members of this Church, that our
   garments might be always white. Perfection we must not hope to see
   here--but oh, we must aim after it. If one should never unite with a
   Christian Church till he found one which is perfect, and free from all
   fault, then such a man must be a schismatic for-ever--for with no
   Christian people could he ever join. Yet, this is what we aspire
   unto--to be faultless before God. We desire to so walk, and to so act
   among men that our conduct may never bring a slur upon our
   profession--that our language, our actions, our motives--everything
   that is about us, may witness to the fact that we have been with Jesus
   and have learned of Him.

   O Brothers and Sisters, it is impossible for one pastor, assisted even
   by the most earnest of elders, to oversee so large a flock as this. Let
   me ask, have you kept your garments white this last week? Oh, if you
   have stained them, I beseech you, repent, repent bitterly before God.
   And if any of you have backslidden, I pray you, do not be hypocrites.
   Let your guilt be fully confessed before God. If you cannot honor this
   Church, do not dishonor it. If you cannot glorify Christ by your walk
   and conversation, at least do not trample under foot His blood and put
   His Cross to an open shame.

   There is nothing which can so injure a Church and cut the sinews of its
   strength, as the unholiness of its members. When we are "fair as the
   moon and clear as the sun," then we shall be "terrible as an army with
   banners." But not till then. Those blots upon the escutcheon, those
   spots upon the garment, are soon perceived by a lynx-eyed world. And
   then they turn round and say, "Ah, these are your Christians. This is
   your religion!" The sons of Belial make excuses for their own
   conscience and go on in their sin, hardened by our mistakes. Oh, let
   this be your prayer, I exhort you, you who are mighty in prayer, never
   forget this day and night, "Lord, keep Your people! Hold them up." I
   can say it has been at all times the bitterest draught I have ever had
   to drink, when any who have professed the name of Christ have turned
   back unto vanity.

   To bury you is but a blessed duty in comparison with noting and
   correcting backsliding and apostasy. I know my prayer for myself has
   been a hundred times, "A speedy death, a soon and sudden sleeping
   beneath the green turf, or even a painful, agonizing, languishing
   decay, upon a bed of pain, rather than you should live to see your
   pastor stain his profession and fall from his integrity." If it be so
   with the minister, it must be so with each of you. Better for you that
   you depart at once than that you should live bearing the name of
   Christ, to make that name a reproach and a byword among the heathen.
   Lord, help us, that we, like Your saints above, may be clothed in white
   garments.

   4. Further, to carry on the parallel. You perceive that these elders
   exercised a priesthood. Indeed, their being clothed in white garments,
   while it is an emblem of their purity, also represents them as being
   priests unto God. They themselves expressly sing in the 10th verse of
   the 5th chapter, "You have made us unto our God kings and priests."
   They exercise the office of the priesthood, as you perceive, by the
   double offering of prayer and praise. They hold in their hands the
   censers full of sweet incense and the harps which give forth melodious
   sounds.

   Brethren, in the wilderness of old they were not all priests. One
   special tribe and one family out of that tribe, alone, could exercise
   that office--the rest of the people stood in the outer court. As for
   the most holy place, into that only came the high priest and he only
   once a year, so much exclusion was there in that age of shadows. But
   now all Believers are priests. We have all a right to stand in the
   priest's place, to offer sacrifice and incense. No, more--through
   Christ we enter into that which is within the veil and stand in the
   most holy place and look at the bright light from the Shekinah, fearing
   not that we shall die, but having boldness and confidence through the
   new and living way, the rent body of Christ.

   The saints before the Throne of God are represented as all of them in
   the holy place, round the Throne, all officiating, every one of them
   presenting sacrifice. Brethren, what are we doing? Let us look up to
   them as the priests of God and then ask ourselves, are we celebrating
   His worship, too? Brother, did you this morning, before you came up to
   this house, lift up your hand with the bowl of incense in it, in your
   earnest prayer for a blessing upon His people? Have you this day in our
   sacred song, been laying your fingers mystically among the strings of
   your golden harp?

   What did you do last week, my Brethren? What were you? Can you say that
   you were a priest? Or, must you not blush that you were rather a buyer
   and a seller, or a thinker and a writer, than a priest unto our God?
   And yet this is our high calling. This is our blessed vocation. Our
   earthly calling is but little honor to us, nor should it engross our
   richest thoughts. Our heavenly calling is of the most importance. It is
   that which is to last forever. It is that which should have the cream
   of our soul's attention. We are priests.

   Oh, Brothers and Sisters, if we have failed in the past, may God give
   us Grace for the future! And during the coming days of the next
   work-day week, may He help us, that our buying and our selling, our
   traveling and our tarrying at home, may all be the exercise of
   priesthood! You know, you can make "the bells upon the horses" holiness
   to the Lord, and the very pots of your house can be as the bowls upon
   the altar. You need not go out of your everyday callings to be priests,
   but be priests in your callings. Sanctify the Lord God in your
   workshops, in your fields, in your marketplaces, in your exchanges. And
   whatever you do, whether you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do it
   all in the name of the Lord Jesus, who has made you priests and kings
   unto Him.

   I know there is a sad tendency among us all to leave the priesthood to
   some peculiar clan. Mark you, members of this Church, I will be no
   priest for you. It is as much as I can do to exercise the priesthood to
   which God calls me on my own account, to offer my own thanks and my own
   petitions. I will have none of your responsibilities. You must be
   priests for yourselves. You cannot shift this burden off, nor would you
   wish, I am sure, if you are true-hearted. You, you say, are poor! You
   are unknown! You have no talent! You need it not, these cannot make you
   priests. How came the sons of Aaron to the priesthood? By birth.

   So with you. You have been "born not of the will of the flesh, nor of
   the will of man, nor of blood, but of God," and the priesthood is the
   inalienable inheritance of the new birth. Exercise your office, then,
   be you who you may, O Beloved of the Lord. In the name of Him who has
   begotten you again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus
   Christ from the dead, live as men sanctified for Divine service, who
   cannot and must not be servants of men and slaves of sin.

   5. Once more and I think I shall have said enough upon this first
   point. There is yet another likeness between the saints in Heaven and
   those on earth. You perceive that these had on their heads crowns of
   gold. They reigned with Christ. He was a king and He made them kings
   with Him. As in the old Persian court the princes of the blood wore
   crowns, so in the court of Heaven the princes of the blood, the
   Brethren of the Lord, are crowned, too. They are royal senators. They
   sit upon thrones, even as He who has overcome and sits down with His
   Father on His Throne.

   These thrones they have to show their dominion, their rights and
   jurisdiction. Know you not that we shall judge angels, and that when
   Christ shall come He will bring His people with Him and they will sit
   upon His throne as co-assessors with Him? Then the wicked, the
   persecutors, the revilers of God's people, shall be brought to judgment
   and the saints whom they despised shall be their judges! So that when
   Christ shall say, "Depart, you cursed," there shall be heard the
   thundering assent of the ten thousands of His saints, as they say
   "Amen," and confirm from their hearts the sentence of the All-Righteous
   Judge. Therefore do these elders sit upon their thrones.

   Now, Beloved, let us imitate them in this. "Oh," you say, "but I cannot
   wear a crown as they do." Nevertheless, you are a king. For they who
   are Christ's are kings. Take care, Brother, that you wear your crown,
   by reigning over your lusts. Reign over your sins. Reign over your
   passions. Be as a king in the midst of all that would lead you astray.
   Christ Jesus has broken the neck of your sin--put your foot upon it.
   Keep it under--subdue it. Be king in the dominions of your own being.
   In the world at large act a king's part. If any would tempt you to
   betray Christ for gain, say, "How can I? I am a king. How shall I
   betray Christ?"

   Let the nobility of your nature come out in your actions. Forgive in a
   royal manner, as a king can forgive. Be ready to give to others as God
   has helped you, as a king gives. Let your liberality of spirit be right
   royal. Let your actions never be mean, sneaking, cowardly, dastardly.
   Do the right thing and defy the worst. Dare all your foes in the
   pursuit of that which is right and let men see while they look upon you
   that there is a something under your homely appearance which they
   cannot understand. Men make a great deal of fuss about the blood of the
   aristocracy. I dare say it is not very different from the blood of
   crossing-sweepers.

   But there is a great deal of difference between the life-blood of the
   saints and the life-blood of the proudest prince. For they who love
   Christ have fed upon His flesh and have drunk of His blood and have
   been made partakers of the Divine nature. These are the royal ones.
   These are the aristocrats. These are the nobility and all are mean
   beside.

   Christians, perhaps some of you have not reigned as kings during the
   last week. Perhaps you have been either murmuring, like poor whining
   beggars, or you have been scraping, like dunghill rakers, with your
   covetousness. Or perhaps you have been sinning, like idle boys in the
   street, who roll in the mire. You have not lived up to your kingship.
   Now I pray you, ask God's Grace that during the week to come you may
   say of sin, "I cannot touch it, I am a king. I cannot demean myself
   with it." That you may say of this earth's dross, "I cannot go down and
   scrape that--my heritage is above." That you may be able to say of
   everything that is low and mean, "Shall such a man as I do this? How
   can I come down from the elevated position to which God has called me,
   to act as others act, from their motives and with their ends?"

   Let, then, the state of the saints above, while it is the theme of our
   delightful thought--while we anticipate the time when we shall fully
   partake of it--be also an example to us while in these lands below.

   II. Briefly upon our second point--THE OCCUPATION AND SPIRIT OF THOSE
   GLORIFIED ONES, AS THEY SHOULD BE IMITATED BY US BELOW.

   1. Notice their occupation. First of all it is one of humility. At the
   tenth verse in our fourth chapter we perceive it is written, "They fall
   down before Him." They are kings but yet they fall down. They wear
   royal crowns, but yet they prostrate themselves. They are second to
   none in God's universe. They stand as first in the peerage of creation.
   Yet before the King they have no honor and no esteem. As if they were
   slaves and menials, they cast themselves upon their faces before His
   Throne, having nothing of their own whereof to glory but boasting alone
   in Him.

   Where holiness is in perfection, there humility is in perfection, too.
   The cherubim veil their faces with their wings, while they cry, "Holy,
   holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth." So do these elders, taking the same
   posture of humility, they bow before the Throne of God.

   Brothers and Sisters, are we as humble as we should be? If we think we
   are, we at once betray our pride. But let us understand how unseemly
   anything but humility must be to us. We are yet on earth. If they in
   Heaven boast not, how dare we? We are yet sinful and erring. If the
   spotless ones bow, what shall we do? If we threw dust and ashes on our
   heads and acknowledged ourselves to be the vilest of the vile, yet were
   the words not too coarse for us, nor the action too humiliating. Far
   from us be the pride which would let us exalt ourselves! Pride is
   natural to us all, Brethren, we cannot get rid of it, even though we
   strive against it. What shall we say of those who nurture it--whose
   very carriage and walk betray the pride of their hearts?

   What shall we say of the pride which finds root in the purse, or that
   which shows itself in outward array and garments? What shall we say of
   the pride of station and of rank which will not permit the professedly
   Christian man to speak with his poorer Brother? Oh, these are damnable
   things! I hope we despise and are rid of these. But there is a subtler
   pride--a pride which mimics humility--a pride which comes in after
   prayer, or after preaching, or after anything that is done for Christ.
   Let us strive against it and be it our constant and daily endeavor to
   fall before the Throne of God, "While less than nothing we can boast
   and vanity confess."

   2. But as they fall before the Throne of God in humility, you will note
   that they express their gratitude. It is said they cast their crowns
   before the Throne. They know where they got them from and they know to
   whom to ascribe the praise. Their crowns are their own and, therefore,
   they wear them on their heads. Their crowns were Jesus' gift and,
   therefore, they cast them at His feet. They wear their crown, for He
   has made them kings and they cannot refuse the dignity. But they cast
   the crown at His feet, for they are only kings by right received from
   Him and acknowledge Him thus to be King of kings and Lord of lords.

   It was a custom, you know, in imperial Rome, for those kings who held
   dominion under the emperor, on certain occasions, to take off their
   crowns and lay them down before the emperor, so that when he bade them
   put them on again, they had fully recognized that their rights of
   kingship flowed only through him. So do they who are before the Throne
   of God. With what rapture, with what joy, with what delight, do they
   cast their crowns there! To think they have a crown and a crown to cast
   before Him!

   Brothers and Sisters, I am afraid when you and I get any Graces, or
   have been made useful in Christ's cause, we are glad for the thing's
   sake. But we are not right, if so. We should be glad because we have
   something to cast at His feet.

   Have you faith? I must thank Him for faith, I must lay it at His feet
   and say, "Jesus, use my faith for Your glory, for You are its Author
   and Finisher." If you and I shall, by Divine Grace, persevere to the
   end and shall arrive at Heaven, it will be a joy to think that we are
   saved, but we will lay it all at the door of Divine love.

   Will you wear a crown, Believer? Will you accept jot or tittle of the
   glory? O no, you will each of you disown anything like the Arminian's
   proud boast of free self-will. It will be Grace, Grace, Divine Grace,
   alone, in Heaven. There will be no division and no discord in that
   eternal hymn. We will cast our crowns at once before Him and we will
   say, "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Your name be all the praise."
   We imitate them, then, in this--in our gratitude mingled with humility.

   3. Further, I well perceive that these elders spent their time in
   joyous song. How glorious was that strain--"You are worthy to take the
   book and to open the seals thereof: for You were slain and have
   redeemed us to God by Your blood, out of every kindred and tongue and
   people and nation." These elders knew that the time was come when all
   earth and Heaven should be more than usually glad. They, with the four
   living creatures, whom we take to be the representatives of some
   special order of presence--angels, about whom we know but little--led
   the strain.

   And as the music rolled through the aisles of Heaven, distant angels,
   who were in all parts of God's dominion keeping watch and ward, stood
   still and listened till they had caught the strain. And then they
   joined with loudest notes, till from north and south and east and west,
   from the highest star and from the uttermost depths, there came up the
   blessed refrain from ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of
   thousands, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and
   riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing."

   Then, as these angelic ones sent up the song, the inferior creatures
   caught the Divine infection and in Heaven and earth, in the sea and the
   uttermost depths, the voice was heard and all creatures responded,
   while the universe echoed with the song, "Blessing, and honor and glory
   and power, be unto Him that sits upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb
   forever and ever." This is the occupation of saints before the Throne
   of God. Be it yours, Brothers and Sisters. Let us, as God's redeemed,
   sing with all our hearts and let us enlist others in the strain. Let us
   remember that we are to be leaders in the hymn of God's works.

   We are to begin with, "Bless the Lord, O my Soul." But we are not to
   end there. We are to go on bidding all God's works praise Him, till we
   come to a climax like that of David, "Bless the Lord, you hosts, you
   ministers of His that do His pleasure; bless the Lord, all His works,
   in all places of His dominion; bless the Lord, O my Soul." The world is
   the organ--we are the players. We are to put our fingers upon the notes
   and wake the universe to thunders of acclaim. We are not to rest with
   our own feeble notes, but we must wake even the dumb earth itself, till
   all the planets, listening to our earth and joining her song, shall
   sing forth the music of the ages.

   God give you, Brothers and Sisters, a desire to imitate the saints!
   Some of you, perhaps, are good hands at groaning--perhaps some of you
   have come up here today mourning and murmuring. Lay these things aside!
   Take up your proper vocation and now smite the strings of your harp!
   Magnify the Lord. Let the day of jubilee come to your spirits. You
   saints of God, rejoice! Yes, in your God, exceedingly rejoice!

   4. Yet once again--these saints not only offered praise, but prayer.
   This was the meaning of the bowls, which are so foolishly translated
   vials. A vial is precisely the opposite of the vessel that was
   intended--the vial is long and narrow-- whereas this is broad and
   shallow. A bowl is meant--full of incense, covered over with a lid and
   perforated with holes-- through which the smoke of the incense rises.
   This does not mean that the four and twenty elders offer the prayers of
   the saints below, but their own prayers.

   Some have asked, Is there any prayer in Heaven? Certainly, there is
   room for prayer in Heaven. If you want proof, we have it in the chapter
   which follows the one out of which we have been reading this
   morning--the ninth verse of the sixth chapter--"I saw under the altar
   the souls of them that were slain for the Word of God and for the
   testimony which they held: and they cried with a loud voice, saying,
   How long, O Lord, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood
   on them that dwell on the earth?"

   There is prayer. Perhaps the prayers of the saints are the major
   portion of that perpetual litany which goes up to Heaven. But leaving
   that for a moment, let us imitate them. If they pray, how much more
   reason have we? If they plead for the universal Church, they who enjoy
   the rest of God, how should we pray who are still in this land of
   temptation and of sin, who see the perils of our Brethren, know their
   weaknesses and their afflictions? Let us draw near unto God. Let us
   never cease, day and night, to offer intercession for the whole company
   of the elect.

   5. I must not forget, however, that these elders before the Throne of
   God were ready not only for prayer and praise but for all kinds of
   service. You remember there was one of them, when John wept, who said,
   "Weep not." Depend upon it--that elder had been occupied in visiting
   the sick when he was on earth. And often when he had gone into their
   cottages and found them sorrowing, he had said unto them, "Weep not."
   And the good man had not lost his character when he went to Heaven,
   although it had been spiritualized and perfected. And seeing John
   weeping, he said to him, "Weep not."

   Ah, those saints before the Throne of God, if there were mourners
   there, would comfort them, I know. And if they could be sent down here
   to visit any of the sorrowing children of God, they would be too glad
   to do it. Then there was, you remember, another of the elders, who said
   to John, for his instruction, "Who are these that are arrayed in white
   robes and from where came they? And I said unto him, Sir, you know. And
   he said to me, These are they that came out of great tribulation." I
   venture to believe that this elder used to teach a catechumen class on
   earth. That he had been in the habit of teaching young people, and he
   put the question to John first, as he had been in the habit previously
   of putting it to young disciples on earth. The saved ones would be
   ready to teach us now, if they could. And they do today bear testimony
   for Christ, for to the ages to come God through His Church makes known
   to principalities and powers the exceeding riches of His Divine Grace.

   Now, those before the Throne are willing to comfort the weeper or to
   instruct the ignorant. Let us do the same! And may it be ours to wipe
   the tears from many an eye, to chase the darkness of ignorance from
   many a young heart. Have you been doing that lately Brothers and
   Sisters? If not, mend your ways. Be more earnest in these two good
   works--visit the fatherless, the widow, the suffering, the mourning,
   those in prison, and teach the ignorant and those that are out of the
   way.

   III. And now, lastly, WHAT IS THEIR WORD AND LESSON TO US THIS MORNING?
   Bending from their shining thrones, being dead they yet speak--and they
   say to us:

   First, by way of encouragement, Brethren, follow on. Be not dismayed.
   We fought the same battles that you fight and passed through the same
   tribulations. Yet we have not perished, but enjoy the eternal reward.
   Press on! Heaven awaits you--vacant thrones are here for you--crowns
   which no other heads can wear--harps that no other hands must play.
   Follow courageously, faithfully, trusting in Him who has begun the good
   work in you and who will carry it on.

   Hear them, again, as they say--Mark the footsteps that we trod. For
   only in one way can you reach our rest. We have washed our robes and
   made them white in the blood of the Lamb. They say to all the world, If
   you would be clean wash there, too. None but Jesus can save your souls.
   Trust in Him. Repose in His atonement, confide in His finished work!
   Flee to His sacrificial blood. You shall be saved by faith in Him, even
   as we have been--

   "I asked them from where their victory came. They with united breath
   Ascribed their conquest to the Lamb, Their triumph to His death."

   Friends! Are you trusting in Christ? My Hearers, many of you are
   perfect strangers to me this morning. I ask you, are you putting your
   trust in Christ? Have you come under the shadow of His Cross, to find a
   refuge from His vengeance? If not, no golden crown can be for you. No
   harp of gold. But, whoever you may be, if you will believe in Christ
   Jesus and put your soul into His hands, you shall be a partaker of the
   glories which He has laid up for them that love Him.

   Lastly, they say to us, as they look down from the battlements of
   Heaven--Are you getting ready to join our ranks, to take up our
   occupations and to sing our songs? Answer for yourself, my Brothers and
   Sisters, as I must answer for myself. Are you living for your own
   pleasure? Then you must die. For, "he that sows to the flesh, shall of
   the flesh reap corruption." Are you living for Christ? Then shall you
   live, "because He lives you shall live also." Are you a priest to God
   today? You shall bear the golden bowl in Heaven. Are you instead a
   servant of your own body, your own lusts, your own gain, your own
   pleasure? Then the lowest depths must be your portion. Heaven is "a
   prepared place for a prepared people." Are we prepared?

   Brothers, Sisters, can we say, "We hope in Christ. He is our only
   trust." And do we endeavor to live to Him? And though with many
   failings and frailties, yet can we still say, "For me to live is
   Christ"? Oh, if it is so,

   "Come, death andsome celestial band, to bear our souls away!" But if it
   is not so, then our end must be destruction, because our God has been
   our belly.

                           God's Will and Man's Will

   A Sermon

   (No. 442)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, March 30th, 1862, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of
   God that showeth mercy."--Romans 9:16

   "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."--Revelation
   22:17

   The great controversy which for many ages has divided the Christian
   Church has hinged upon the difficult question of "the will." I need not
   say of that conflict that it has done much mischief to the Christian
   Church, undoubtedly it has; but I will rather say, that it has been
   fraught with incalculable usefulness; for it has thrust forward before
   the minds of Christians, precious truths, which but for it, might have
   been kept in the shade. I believe that the two great doctrines of human
   responsibility and divine sovereignty have both been brought out the
   more prominently in the Christian Church by the fact that there is a
   class of strong-minded hard-headed men who magnify sovereignty at the
   expense of responsibility; and another earnest and useful class who
   uphold and maintain human responsibility oftentimes at the expense of
   divine sovereignty. I believe there is a needs-be for this in the
   finite character of the human mind, while the natural lethargy of the
   Church requires a kind of healthy irritation to arouse her powers and
   to stimulate her exertions. The pebbles in the living stream of truth
   are worn smooth and round by friction. Who among us would wish to
   suspend a law of nature whose effects on the whole are good? I glory in
   that which at the present day is so much spoken against--sectarianism,
   for "sectarianism" is the cant phrase which our enemies use for all
   firm religious belief. I find it applied to all sorts of Christians; no
   matter what views he may hold, if a man be but earnest, he is a
   sectarian at once. Success to sectarianism, let it live and flourish.
   When that is done with, farewell to the power of godliness. When we
   cease, each of us, to maintain our own views of truth, and to maintain
   those views firmly and strenuously, then truth shall fly out of hand,
   and error alone shall reign: this, indeed, is the object of our foes:
   under the cover of attacking sects, they attack true religion, and
   would drive it, if they could, from off the face of the earth. In the
   controversy which has raged,--a controversy which, I again say, I
   believe to have been really healthy, and which has done us all a vast
   amount of good-- mistakes have arisen from two reasons. Some brethren
   have altogether forgotten one order of truths, and then, in the next
   place, they have gone too far with others. We all have one blind eye,
   and too often we are like Nelson in the battle, we put the telescope to
   that blind eye, and then protest that we cannot see. I have heard of
   one man who said he had read the Bible through thirty-four times on his
   knees, but could not see a word about election in it; I think it very
   likely that he could not; kneeling is a very uncomfortable posture for
   reading, and possibly the superstition which would make the poor man
   perform this penance would disqualify him for using his reason:
   moreover, to get through the Book thirty-four times, he probably read
   in such a hurry that he did not know what he was reading, and might as
   well have been dreaming over "Robinson Crusoe" as the Bible. He put the
   telescope to the blind eye. Many of us do that; we do not want to see a
   truth, and therefore we say we cannot see it. On the other hand, there
   are others who push a truth too far. "This is good; oh! this is
   precious!" say they, and then they think it is good for everything;
   that in fact it is the only truth in the world. You know how often
   things are injured by over-praise; how a good medicine, which really
   was a great boon for a certain disease, comes to be despised utterly by
   the physician, because a certain quack has praised it up as being a
   universal cure; so puffery in doctrine leads to dishonor. Truth has
   thus suffered on all sides; on the one hand brethren would not see the
   truth, and on the other hand they magnified out of proportion that
   which they did see. You have seen those mirrors, those globes that are
   sometimes hung in gardens; you walk up to them and you see your head
   ten times as large as your body, or you walk away and put yourself in
   another position, a then your feet are monstrous and the rest of your
   body is small; this is an ingenious toy, but I am sorry to say that
   many go to work with God's truth upon the model of this toy; they
   magnify one capital truth till it becomes monstrous; they minify and
   speak little of another truth till it becomes altogether forgotten. In
   what I shall be able say this morning you will probably detect the
   failing to which I allude, the common fault of humanity, and suspect
   that I also am magnifying one truth at the expense of another; but I
   will say this, before I proceed further, that it shall not be the case
   if I can help it, but I will endeavor honestly to bring out the truth
   as I have learned it, and if in ought ye see that I teach you what is
   contrary to the Word of God, reject it; but mark you, if it be
   according to God's Word, reject it at your peril; for when I have once
   delivered it to you, if ye receive it not the responsibility lies with
   you.

   There are two things, then, this morning I shall have to talk about.
   The first is, that the work of salvation rests upon the will of God,
   and not upon the will of man; and secondly, the equally sure doctrine,
   that the will of man has its proper position in the work of salvation,
   and is not to be ignored.

   I. First, then, SALVATION HINGES UPON THE WILL OF GOD AND NOT UPON THE
   WILL OF MAN. So saith out text--"It is not of him that willeth nor of
   him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy;" by which is clearly
   meant that the reason why any man is saved is not because he wills it,
   but because God willed, accord to that other passage, "Ye have not
   chosen me, but I have chosen you." The whole scheme of salvation, we
   aver, from the first to the last, hinges and turns, and is dependent
   upon the absolute will of God, and not upon the will of the creature.

   This, we think, we can show in two or three ways; and first, we think
   that analogy furnishes us with a rather strong argument. There is a
   certain likeness between all God's works; if a painter shall paint
   three pictures, there is a certain identity of style about all the
   three which leads you to know that they are from the same hand. Or, if
   an author shall write three works upon three different subjects, yet
   there are qualities running through the whole, which lead you to
   assert, "That is the same man's writing, I am certain, in the whole of
   the three books." Now what we find in the works of nature, we generally
   find to be correct with regard to the work of providence; and what is
   true of nature and of providence, is usually true with regard to the
   greater work of grace. Turn your thoughts, then, to the works of
   creation. There was a time when these works had no existence; the sun
   was not born; the young moon had not begun to fill her horns; the stars
   were not; not even the illimitable void of space was then in existence.
   God dwelt alone without a creature. I ask you, with whom did he then
   take counsel? Who instructed him? Who had a voice in the counsel by
   which the wisdom of God was directed? Did it not rest with his own will
   whether he would make or not? Was not creation itself, when it lay in
   embryo in his thoughts entirely, in his keeping, so that he would or
   would not just as he pleased? And when he willed to create, did he not
   still exercise his own discretion and will as to what and how he would
   make? If he hath made the stars spheres, what reason was there for this
   but his own will? If he hath chosen that they should move in the circle
   rather than in any other orbit, is it not God's own fiat that hath made
   them do so? And when this round world, this green earth on which we
   dwell, leaped from his molding hand into its sunlit track, was not this
   also according to the divine will? Who ordained, save the Lord, that
   there the Himalayas should lift up their heads and pierce the clouds,
   and that there the deep cavernous recesses of the sea should pierce
   earth's bowels of rock? Who, save himself, ordained that yon Sahara
   should be brown and sterile, and that yonder isle should laugh in the
   midst of the sea with joy over her verdure? Who, I say, ordained this,
   save God? You see running through creation, from the tiniest animalcule
   up to the tall archangel who stands before the throne, this working of
   God's own will. Milton was nobly right when he represents the Eternal
   One as saying,

   My goodness is most free

   To act or not: Necessity and Chance

   Approach not me, and what I will is fate.

   He created as it pleased him; he made them as he chose; the potter
   exercised power over his clay to make his vessels as he willed, and to
   make them for what purposes he pleased. Think you that he has abdicated
   the throne of grace? Does he reign in creation and not in grace? Is he
   absolute king over nature and not over the greater works of the new
   nature? Is he Lord over the things which his hand made at first, and
   not King over the great regeneration, the new-making wherein he maketh
   all things new?

   But take the works of Providence. I suppose there will be no dispute
   amongst us that in providential matters God ordereth all things
   according to the counsel of his own will. If we should, however, be
   troubled with doubts about the matter, we might hear the striking words
   of Nebuchadnezzar when, taught by God, he had repented of his pride--
   "All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; he doth
   according to his will in the armies of heaven and among the inhabitants
   of the earth, and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest
   thou." From the first moment of human history even to the last, God's
   will shall be done. What though it be a catastrophe or a crime--there
   may be the second causes and the action of human evil, but the great
   first cause is in all. If we could imagine that one human action had
   eluded the prescience or the predestination of God, we could suppose
   that the whole might have done so, and all things might drift to sea,
   anchorless, rudderless, a sport to every wave, the victim of tempest
   and hurricane. One leak in the ship of Providence would sink her, one
   hour in which Omnipotence relaxed its grasp and she would fall to
   atoms. But it is the comfortable conviction of all God's people that
   "all things work together for good to them that love God;" and that God
   ruleth and overruleth, and reigneth in all acts of men and in all
   events that transpire; from seeming evil still producing good, and
   better still, and better still in infinite progression, still ordering
   all things according the counsel of his will. And think you that he
   reigns in Providence and is King there, and not in grace? Has he given
   up the blood-bought land to be ruled by man, while common Providence is
   left as a lonely providence to be his only heritage? He hath not let
   slip the reins of the great chariot of Providence, and think you that
   when Christ goeth forth in the chariot of his grace it is with steeds
   unguided, or driven only by chance, or by the fickle will of man? Oh,
   no brethren. As surely as God's will is the axle of the universe, as
   certainly as God's will is the great heart of providence sending its
   pulsings through even the most distant limbs of human act, so in grace
   let us rest assured that he is King, willing to do as he pleases,
   having mercy on whom he will have mercy, calling whom he chooses to
   call, quickening whom he wills, and fulfilling, despite man's hardness
   of heart, despite man's willful rejection of Christ, his own purposes,
   his won decrees, without one of them falling to the ground. We think,
   then, that analogy helps to strengthen us in the declaration of e text,
   that salvation is not left with man's will.

   2. But, secondly, we believe that the difficulties which surround the
   opposite theory are tremendous. In fact, we cannot bear to look them in
   the face. If there be difficulties about ours, there are ten times more
   about the opposite. We think that the difficulties which surround our
   belief that salvation depends upon the will of God, arise from our
   ignorance in not understanding enough of God to be able to judge of
   them; but that the difficulties in the other case do not arise from
   that cause, but from certain great truths, clearly revealed, which
   stand in manifest opposition to the figment which our opponents have
   espoused. According to their theory--that salvation depends upon our
   own will-- you have first of all this difficulty to meet, that you have
   made the purpose of God in the great plan of salvation entirely
   contingent. You have the put an "if" upon everything. Christ may die,
   but it is not certain according to that theory that he will redeem a
   great multitude; nay, not certain that he will redeem any, since the
   efficacy of the redemption according to that plan, rests not in its own
   intrinsic power, but in the will of man accepting that redemption.
   Hence if man be, as we aver he always is, if he be a bond-slave as to
   his will, and will not yield to the invitation of God's grace, then in
   such a case the atonement of Christ would be valueless, useless, and
   altogether in vain, for not a soul would be saved by it; and even when
   souls are saved by it, according to that theory, the efficacy, I say,
   lies not in the blood itself, but in the will of man which gives it
   efficacy. Redemption is therefore made contingent; the cross shakes,
   the blood falls powerless on the ground, and atonement is a matter of
   perhaps. There is a heaven provided, but there may no souls who will
   ever come there if their coming is to be of themselves. There is a
   fountain filled with blood, but there may be none who will ever wash in
   it unless divine purpose and power shall constrain them to come. You
   may look at any one promise of grace, but you cannot say over it, "This
   is the sure mercy of David;" for there is an "if," and a "but;" a
   "perhaps," and a "peradventure." In fact, the reigns are gone out of
   God's hands; the linch-pin is taken away from the wheels of the
   creation; you have left the whole economy of grace and mercy to be the
   gathering together of fortuitous atoms impelled by man's own will, and
   what may become of it at the end nobody can know. We cannot tell on
   that theory whether God will be gloried or sin will triumph. Oh! how
   happy are we when come back to the old fashioned doctrines, and cast
   our anchor where it can get its grip in the eternal purpose and counsel
   of God, who worketh all things to the good pleasure of his will.

   Then another difficulty comes in; not only is everything made
   contingent, but it does seem to us as if man were thus made to be the
   supreme being in the universe. According to the freewill scheme the
   Lord intends good, but he must win like a lackey on his own creature to
   know what his intention is; God willeth good and would do it, but he
   cannot, because he has an unwilling man who will not have God's good
   thing carried into effect. What do ye, sirs, but drag the Eternal from
   his throne, and lift up into it that fallen creature, man: for man,
   according to that theory nods, and his nod is destiny. You must have a
   destiny somewhere; it must either be as God wills or as man wills . If
   it be as God wills , then Jehovah sits as sovereign upon his throne of
   glory, and all hosts obey him, and the world is safe; if not God, then
   you put man there, to say. "I will" or "I will not; if I will it I will
   enter heaven; if I will it I will despise the grace of God; if I will
   it I will conquer the Holy Sprit, for I am stronger than God, and
   stronger than omnipotence; if I will it I will make the blood of Christ
   of no effect, for I am mightier than that blood, mightier than the
   blood of the Son of God himself; though God make his purpose, yet will
   I laugh at his purpose; it shall be my purpose that shall make his
   purpose stand, or make it fall." Why, sirs, if this be not Atheism, it
   is idolatry; it is putting man where God should be, and I shrink with
   solemn awe and horror from that doctrine which makes the grandest of
   God's works--the salvation man--to be dependent upon the will of his
   creature whether it shall be accomplished or not. Glory I can and must
   in my text in its fullest sense. "It is not of him that willeth, nor of
   him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy."

   3. We think that the known condition of man is a very strong argument
   against the supposition that salvation depends upon his own will; and
   hence is a great confirmation of the truth that it depends upon the
   will of God; that it is God that chooses, and not man,--God who takes
   the first step, and not the creature. Sirs, on the theory that man
   comes to Christ of his own will, what do you with texts of Scripture
   which say that he is dead? "And you hath he quickened who were dead in
   trespasses and sins;" you will say that is a figure. I grant it, but
   what is the meaning of it? You say the meaning is, he is spiritually
   dead. Well, then I ask you, how can he perform the spiritual act of
   willing that which is right? He is alive enough to will that which is
   evil, only evil and that continually, but he is not alive to will that
   which is spiritually good. Do you not know, to turn to another
   Scripture, that he cannot even discern that which is spiritual? for the
   natural man knoweth not the things which be of God, seeing they are
   spiritual and must be spiritually discerned. Why, he has not a "spirit"
   with which to discern them; he has only a soul and body, but the third
   principle, implanted in regeneration, which is called in the Word of
   God, "the spirit," he knows nothing of and he is therefore incapable,
   seeing he is dead and is without the vitalizing spirit, of doing what
   you say he does. Then again, what make you of the words of our Saviour
   where he said to those who had heard even him, "Ye will not come to me
   that ye might have life?" Where is free-will after such a text as that?
   When Christ affirms that they will not, who dare say they will? "Ah,
   but," you say, "they could if they would." Dear sir, I am not talking
   about that; I am talking about if they would, the question is "will
   they?" and we say "no," they never will by nature. Man is so depraved,
   so set on mischief, and the way of salvation is so obnoxious to his
   pride, so hateful to his lusts, that he cannot like it, and will not
   like it, unless he who ordained the plan shall change his nature, and
   subdue his will. Mark, this stubborn will of man is his sin; he is not
   to be excused for it; he is guilty because he will not come; he is
   condemned because he will not come; because he will not believe in
   Christ, therefore is condemnation resting upon him, but still the fact
   does not alter for all that, that he will not come by nature if left to
   himself. Well, then, if man will not, how shall he be saved unless God
   shall make him will?--unless, in some mysterious way, he who made heart
   shall touch its mainspring so that it shall move in a direction
   opposite to that which it naturally follows.

   4. But there is another argument which will come closer home to us. It
   is consistent with the universal experience of all God's people that
   salvation is of God's will. You will say, "I have not had a very long
   life, I have not, but I have had a very extensive acquaintance with all
   sections of the Christian Church, and I solemnly protest before you,
   that I have never yet met with a man professing to be a Christian, let
   alone his really being so, who ever said that his coming to God was the
   result of his unassisted nature. Universally, I believe, without
   exception, the people of God will say it was the Holy Spirit that made
   them what they are; that they should have refused to come as others do
   unless God's grace had sweetly influenced their wills. There are some
   hymns in Mr. Wesley's hymn-book which are stronger upon this point than
   I could ever venture to be, for he puts prayer into the lips of the
   sinner in which God is even asked to force him to be saved by grace. Of
   course I can take no objection to a term so strong, but it goes to
   prove this, that among all sections of Christians, whether Arminian or
   Calvinistic, whatever their doctrinal sentiments may be, their
   experimental sentiments are the same. I do not think they would any of
   them refuse to join in the verse--

   Oh! yes, I do love Jesus,

   Because he first loved me.

   Nor would they find fault with our own hymn,

   'Twas the same love that spread the feast,

   That sweetly forced us in;

   Else we had still refused to taste,

   And perished in our sin.

   We bring out the crown and say, "On whose head shall we put it? Who
   ruled at the turning-point? Who decided this case?" and the universal
   Church of God, throwing away their creeds, would say. "Crown him; crown
   him, put it on his head, for he is worthy; he has made us to differ; he
   has done it, and unto him be the praise for ever and ever." What
   staggers me is, that men can believe dogmas contrary to their own
   experience,--that they can hug that to their hearts as precious to
   which their own inward convictions must give the lie.

   5. But, lastly, in the way of argument. and to bring our great
   battering-ram at the last. It is not, after all, arguments from
   analogy, nor reasons from the difficulties of the opposite position,
   nor inferences from the know feebleness of human nature, nor even
   deductions from experience, that will settle this question once for
   all. To the law and to the testimony, if they speak not accord to this
   word, it is because there is no light in them. Do me the pleasure,
   then, to use your Bibles for a moment or two, and let us see what
   Scripture saith on this main point. First, with regard to the matter of
   God's preparation, and his plan with regard to salvation. We turn to
   the apostle's words in the epistle to the Ephesians, and we find in the
   first chapter and the third verse, "Blessed be the God and Father of
   our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings
   in heavenly places in Christ, according as he hath chosen us in him
   before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without
   blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the adoption of
   children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of
   his will"--a double word you notice--it is according to the will of his
   will. No expression could be stronger in the original to show the
   entire absoluteness of this thing as depending on the will God. It
   seems, then, that the choice of his people their adoption is according
   to his will. So far we are satisfied, indeed, with the testimony of the
   apostle. Then in the ninth verse, "Having made known unto us the
   mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath
   purposed in himself: that in the dispensation of the fullness of times
   he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
   heaven and which are on earth; even in him." So, then, it seems that
   the grand result of the gathering together of all the saved in Christ,
   as well as the primitive purpose, is according to the counsel of his
   will. What stronger proof can there be that salvation depends upon the
   will of God? Moreover, it says in the eleventh verse--"In whom also we
   have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the
   purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own
   will:" a stronger expression than "of his will"--"of his own will," his
   free unbiased will, his will alone. As for redemption as well as for
   the eternal purpose--redemption is according to the will of God. You
   remember that verse in Hebrews, tenth chapter, ninth verse: "Lo, I come
   to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he might
   establish the second. By the which will we are sanctified." So that the
   redemption offered up on Calvary, like the election made before the
   foundation of the world, is the result of the divine will. There will
   be little controversy here: the main point is about our new birth, and
   here we cannot allow of any diversity of opinion. Turn to the Gospel
   according to John, the first chapter and thirteenth verse. It is
   utterly impossible that human language could have put a stronger
   negative on the vainglorious claims of the human will than this passage
   does: "Born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
   of man, but of God." A passage equally clear is to be found in the
   Epistle of James, at the first chapter, and the eighteenth verse: "Of
   his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a
   kind of first-fruits of his creatures." In these passages--and they are
   not the only ones--the new birth is peremptorily and in the strongest
   language put down as being the fruit and effect of the will and purpose
   of God. As to the sanctification which is the result and outgrowth of
   the new birth, that also is according to God's holy will. In the first
   of Thessalonians, fourteenth chapter, and third verse, we have, "This
   is the will of God, even your sanctification." One more passage I shall
   need you to refer to, the sixteenth chapter, and thirty-ninth verse.
   Here we find that the preservation, the perseverance, the resurrection,
   and the eternal glory of God's people, rests upon his will. "And this
   is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath
   given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the
   last day; and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which
   seeth the Son and believeth on him, may have everlasting life, and I
   will raise him up at the last day." And indeed this is why the saints
   go to heaven at all, because in the seventeenth chapter of John, Christ
   is recorded as praying, "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast
   given me, be with me where I am." We close, then, by noticing that
   according to Scripture there is not a single blessing in the new
   covenant which is not conferred upon us according to the will of God,
   and that as the vessel hangs upon the nail, so every blessing, we
   receive hangs upon the absolute will and counsel of God, who gives
   these mercies even as he gives the gifts of the Spirit according as he
   wills. We shall now leave that point, and take the second great truth,
   and speak a little while upon it.

   II. MAN'S WILL HAS ITS PROPER PLACE IN THE MATTER OF SALVATION.
   "Whosoever will let him come and take the water of life freely."
   According to this and many other texts the Scripture where man is
   addressed as a being having a will, it appears clear enough that men
   are not saved by compulsion. When a man receives the grace of Christ,
   he does not receive it against his will. No man shall be pardoned while
   he abhors the though forgiveness. No man shall have joy in the Lord if
   he says, "I do not wish to rejoice in the Lord." Do not think that
   anybody shall have the angels pushing them behind into the gates of
   heaven. They must go there freely or else they will never go there at
   all. We are not saved against our will; nor again, mark you, is the
   will taken away; for God does not come and convert the intelligent
   free-agent into a machine. When he turns the slave into a child, it is
   not by plucking out of him the will which he possesses. We are as free
   under grace as ever we were under sin; nay, we were slaves when we were
   under sin, and when the Son makes us free we are free indeed, and we
   are never free before. Erskine, in speaking of his own conversion, says
   he ran to Christ "with full consent against his will," by which he
   meant it was against his old will; against his will as it was till
   Christ came, but when Christ came, then he came to Christ with full
   consent, and was as willing to be saved--no, that is a cold word--as
   delighted, as pleased, as transported to receive Christ as if grace had
   not constrained him. But we do hold and teach that though the will of
   man is not ignored, and men are not saved against their wills, that the
   work of the Spirit, which is the effect of the will of God, is to
   change the human will, and so make men willing in the day of God's
   power, working in them to will to do of his own good pleasure. The work
   of the Spirit is consistent with the original laws and constitution of
   human nature. Ignorant men talk grossly and carnally about the work of
   the Spirit in the heart as if the heart were a lump of flesh, and the
   Holy Spirit turned it round mechanically. Now, brethren, how is your
   heart and my heart changed in any matter? Why, the instrument generally
   is persuasion. A friend sets before us a truth we did not know before;
   pleads with us; puts it in a new light, and then we say, "Now I see
   that," and then our hearts are changed towards the thing. Now, although
   no man's heart is changed by moral suasion in itself, yet the way in
   which the Spirit works in his heart, as far as we can detect it, is
   instrumentally by a blessed persuasion of the mind. I say not that men
   are saved by moral suasion, or that this is the first cause, but I
   think it is frequently the visible means. As to the secret work, who
   knows how the Spirit works? "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
   thou hearest the sound thereof, but thou canst not tell whence it
   cometh nor whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the
   Spirit;" but yet, as far as we can see, the Spirit makes a revelation
   of truth to the soul, whereby it seeth things in a different light from
   what it ever did before, and then the will cheerfully bows that neck
   which once was stiff as iron, and wears the yoke which once it
   despised, and wears it gladly, cheerfully, and joyfully. Yet, mark, the
   will is not gone; the will is treated as it should be treated; man is
   not acted upon as a machine, he is not polished like a piece of marble;
   he is not planed and smoothed like a plank of deal; but his mind is
   acted upon by the Spirit of God, in a manner quite consistent with
   mental laws. Man is thus made a new creature in Christ Jesus, by the
   will of God, and his own will is blessedly and sweetly made to yield.

   Then, mark you,--and this is a point which I want to put into the
   thoughts of any who are troubled about these things,--this gives the
   renewed soul a most blessed sign of grace, insomuch that if any man
   wills to be saved by Christ, if he wills to have sin forgiven through
   the precious blood, if he wills to live by a holy life resting upon the
   atonement of Christ, and in the power of the Spirit, that will is one
   of the most blessed signs of the mysterious working of the Spirit of
   God in his heart; such a sign is it that if it be real willingness, I
   will venture to assert that that man is not far from the kingdom. I say
   not that he is so saved that he himself may conclude he is, but there
   is a work begun, which has the germ of salvation in it. If thou art
   willing, depend upon it that God is willing. Soul, if thou art anxious
   after Christ, he is more anxious after thee. If thou hast only one
   spark of true desire after him, that spark is a spark from the fire of
   his love to thee. He has drawn thee, or else thou wouldest never run
   after him. If you are saying, "Come to me, Jesus," it is because he has
   come to you, though you do not know it. He has sought you as a lost
   sheep, and therefore you have sought him like a returning prodigal. He
   has swept the house to find you, as the woman swept for the lost piece
   of money, and now you seek him as a lost child would seek a father's
   face. Let your willingness to come to Christ be a hopeful sign and
   symptom.

   But once more, and let me have the ear of the anxious yet again. It
   appears that when you have a willingness to come to Christ, there is a
   special promise for you. You know, my dear hearers, that we are not
   accustomed in this house of prayer to preach one side of truth, but we
   try if we can to preach it all. There are some brethren with small
   heads, who, when they have heard a strong doctrinal sermon, grow into
   hyper-Calvinists, and then when we preach an inviting sermon to poor
   sinners, they cannot understand it, and say it is a yea and nay gospel.
   Believe me, it is not yea and nay, but yea and yea. We give your yea to
   all truth, and our nay we give to no doctrine of God. Can a sinner be
   saved when he wills to come to Christ? Yea. And if he does come, does
   he come because God brings him? Yea. We have no nays in our theology
   for any revealed truth. We do not shut the door on one word and open it
   to another. Those are the yea and nay people who have a nay for the
   poor sinner, when they profess to preach the gospel. As soon as a man
   has any willingness given to him, he has a special promise. Before he
   had the willingness he had an invitation. Before he had any
   willingness, it was his duty to believe in Christ, for it is not man's
   condition that gives him a right to believe. Men are to believe in
   obedience to God's command. God commandeth all men everywhere to
   repent, and this is his great command, "Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and thou shalt be saved." "This is the commandment, that ye
   believe in Jesus Christ whom he has sent." Hense your right and your
   duty to believe; but once you have got the willingness, then you have a
   special promise--"Whosoever will let him come." That is a sort of
   extraordinary invitation. Methinks this is the utterance of the special
   call. You know how John Bunyan describes the special call in words to
   this effect. "The hen goes clucking about the farm-yard all day long;
   that is the general call of the gospel; but she sees a hawk up in the
   sky, and she gives a sharp cry for her little ones to come and hide
   under her wings; that is the special call; they come and are safe." My
   text is a special call to some of you. Poor soul! are you willing to be
   saved? "O, sir, willing, willing indeed; I cannot use that word; I
   would give all I have if I might but be saved." Do you mean you would
   give it all in order to purchase it? "Oh no, sir, I do not mean that; I
   know I cannot purchase it; I know it is God's gift, but still, if I
   could be but saved, I would ask nothing else.

   Lord, deny me what thou wilt,

   Only ease me of my guilt;

   Suppliant at thy feet I lie,

   Give me Christ, or else I die.

   Why, then the Lord speaks to you this morning, to you if not to any
   other man in the chapel, he speaks to you and says--"Whosoever will let
   him come." You cannot say this does not mean you. When we give the
   general invitation, you may exempt yourself perhaps in some way or
   other, but you cannot now. You are willing, then come and take the
   water of life freely. "Had not I better pray?" It does not say so; it
   says, take the water of life. "But had not I better go home and get
   better?" No, take the water of life, and take the water of life now.
   You are standing by the fountain outside there, and the water is
   flowing and you are willing to drink; you are picked out of a crowd who
   are standing round about, and you are specially invited by the person
   who built the fountain. He says, "Here is a special invitation for you;
   you are willing; come and drink." "Sir," you say, "I must go home and
   wash my pitcher." "No," says he, "come and drink." "But, sir, I want to
   go home and write a petition to you." "I do not want it," he says,
   "drink now, drink now." What would you do? If you were dying of thirst,
   you would just put your lips down and drink. Soul, do that now. Believe
   that Jesus Christ is able to save thee now. Trust thy soul in his hands
   now. No preparation is wanted. Whosoever will let him come; let him
   come at once and take the water of life freely. To take that water is
   simply to trust Christ; to repose on him; to take him to be your all in
   all. Oh that thou wouldest do it now! Thou are willing; God has made
   thee willing. When the crusaders heard the voice of Peter the hermit,
   as he bade them go to Jerusalem to take it from the hands of the
   invaders, they cried out at once, "Deus vult; God wills it; God wills
   it;" and every man plucked his sword from its scabbard, and set out to
   reach the holy sepulchre, for God willed it. So come and drink, sinner;
   God wills it. Trust Jesus; God wills it. If you will it, that is the
   sign that God wills it. "Father, thy will be done on earth even as it
   is in heaven." As sinners, humbly stoop to drink from the flowing
   crystal which streams from the sacred fountain which Jesus opened for
   his people; let it be said in heaven, "God's will is done; hallelujah,
   hallelujah!" "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
   but of God that sheweth mercy;" yet "Whosoever will let him come and
   take the water of life freely."

                     Sermon 443. The Two Draughts Of Fishes

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 6, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now when He had left speaking, He said unto Simon, Launch out into the
   deep and let down your nets for a draught." Luke 5:4

   "And He said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and
   you shall find some. They cast therefore and now they were not able to
   draw it for the multitude of fishes."

   John 21:6.

   THE whole life of Christ was a sermon. He was a Prophet mighty in word
   and deed. And by His deeds as well as His words He taught the people.
   It is perfectly true that the miracles of Christ attest His mission. To
   those who saw them they must have been evident proof that He was sent
   of God. But we ought not to overlook that probably a higher reason for
   the miracles is to be found in the instruction which they convey. To
   the world without, at the present time, the miracles of Christ are more
   hard to believe than the doctrine which He taught. Skeptics turn them
   into stones of stumbling and when they cannot object at the marvelous
   teaching of Jesus, they attack the miracles as monstrous and
   incredible.

   I doubt not that even to minds seriously vexed with unbelief, the
   miracles, instead of being helps to belief, have been trials of faith.
   Few, indeed, are there in whom faith is worked by signs and wonders.
   Nor, indeed is this the Gospel way of bringing conviction to the
   soul--the secret force of the Living Word is the chosen instrumentality
   of Christ--and wonders are left to be the resort of that Anti-Christ by
   whom the nations shall be deceived. We, who by Divine Grace have
   believed, view the miracles of Christ as noble attestations to His
   mission and Divinity. But we confess that we value them even more as
   instructive homilies than as attesting witnesses.

   It is our conviction that we should lose much of the benefit which they
   were meant to convey to us, if we were merely to view them as seals to
   the roll, for they are a part of the writing of the roll itself. The
   marvels worked by our blessed Lord are acted sermons fraught with holy
   doctrine, set forth to us more vividly than it could have been in
   words. We start with the assumption upon which our sermon will be
   grounded this morning--that Christ's miracles are sermons preached in
   deeds--visible allegories, truths embodied, principles incarnated and
   set in motion. They are, in fact, the pictures in the great book of
   Christ's teaching--the illustrations by which He flashed light into dim
   eyes.

   We have heard of some ministers who could say that they had often
   preached from the same text but they had never delivered the same
   discourse. The like may be said of Christ. He often preached upon the
   same Truth of God but it was never precisely in the same manner. We
   have read in your hearing this morning, the narrative of two miracles
   (Luke 5, and John 21), which seem to the casual observer to be
   precisely alike. But he who shall read diligently and study carefully,
   will find that though the text is the same in both, the discourse is
   full of variations.

   In both the miraculous draughts of fishes, the text is the mission of
   the saints to preach the Gospel--the work of man-catching--the ministry
   by which souls are caught in the net of the Gospel and brought out of
   the element of sin to their eternal salvation. The preacher is compared
   to a fisherman. The fisherman's vocation is a toilsome one. Woe be to
   that minister who finds his calling to be otherwise. The fisherman must
   go forth in rough weathers and at all hazards. If he should only fish
   in a calm sea he may often starve. So the Christian minister, whether
   men will receive the Word with pleasure, or reject it with anger and
   wrath, must be ready to imperil reputation and risk comfort.

   Yes, he must hate his own life, also, or he is not worthy of the
   heavenly calling. The fisherman's is a rough occupation--no dainty
   fingers may come in contact with his nets. It is not a trade for
   gentlemen, but for rough, strong, fearless men, who can heave a rope,
   handle a tar-brush, or scour a deck. The ministry is not meant for your
   dainty souls who would go delicately through this world without a
   trial, an offense, an insult, or a sneer. Such work is meant for men
   who know how to do business on great waters and can go abroad upon the
   sea, not fearing the spray or the waves. The fisher- man's calling,
   too, must be carried on perseveringly. It is not by one grand haul that
   a man makes his fortune. He must constantly cast forth his net.

   One sermon makes not a preacher. He who shall but now and then deliver
   himself of some carefully prepared oration, is no true minister of God.
   He must be instant in season and out of season. He must cast his net in
   all waters. He must in the morning be at his work and in the evening he
   must not withhold his hand. To be a fisherman, a man must expect
   disappointments. He must often cast in the net and bring up nothing but
   weeds. The minister of Christ must reckon upon being disappointed--and
   he must not be weary in well-doing for all his disappointments--but
   must in faith continue in prayer and labor, expecting that at the end
   he shall receive his reward. It needs no great labor for you to work
   out at leisure the comparison between fishermen and the Gospel
   ministry, the simile is so aptly chosen.

   The two narratives before us have a degree of uniformity. That shall be
   our first point. But they have a greater degree of dissimilarity. We
   will bring that out in the second place. And, then, thirdly, we will
   suggest some great lessons which they both combine to teach us.

   I. First, then, IN THESE TWO MIRACLES THERE ARE MANY POINTS OF
   UNIFORMITY. They are both intended to set forth the way in which
   Christ's kingdom shall increase.

   1. First you will perceive that in both miracles we are taught that the
   means must be used. In the first case, the fish did not leap into
   Simon's boat to be taken. Nor, in the second case, did they swarm from
   the sea and lay themselves down upon the blazing coals that they might
   be prepared for the fisherman's feast. No, the fishermen must go out in
   their boat. They must cast the net. And after having cast the net, they
   must either drag it ashore, or fill both boats with its contents.
   Everything is done here by human agency.

   It is a miracle, certainly, but yet neither the fisherman, nor his
   boat, nor his fishing tackle are ignored. They are all used and all
   employed. Let us learn that in the saving of souls God works by means.
   So long as the present economy of Grace shall stand, God will be
   pleased by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.
   Every now and then there creeps up in the Church a sort of striving
   against God's ordained instrumentality. I marked it with sorrow dating
   the Irish Revival.

   We constantly saw, in some excellent papers, remarks which I thought
   exceedingly injurious--wherein it was made a subject of congratulation
   that no man was concerned in the work. No eminent preacher, no fervent
   Evangelist. The whole was boasted to be conducted without human
   instrumentality. That was the weakness of the Revival, not its
   strength. You say it gave God more glory. Not so. God gets the most
   glory through the use of instruments. When God works without
   instruments, doubtless He is glorified. But He knows Himself in which
   way He gets the most honor and He has Himself selected the plan of
   instrumentality as being that by which He is most magnified in the
   earth.

   We have this treasure. How? Alone? Without any earthly accompaniments?
   No. But in earthen vessels. What for? That God may have less glory? No.
   But in the earthen vessels on purpose, "that the excellency of the
   treasure may be of God," and not of us. God makes the infirmity of the
   creature to be the foil to the strength of the Creator. He takes men
   who are nothing in themselves, and works by them His splendid
   victories. Perhaps we would not admire Samson so much if he had dashed
   the Philistines in pieces with his fists, as we do when we find that
   with such a weapon, so unadapted to the work, as the jawbone of an ass,
   he laid on heaps the thousands of his foes.

   The Lord takes ill weapons, that with them He may work great deeds.
   When He said, "Let there be light and there was light" without any
   instrument, He showed His glory. But when instead, thereof, He takes
   the Apostles and says again, "Let there be light," and sends them forth
   who were darkness in themselves and makes them the medium of lighting
   up a dark world, I say there is a greater glory. And if the morning
   stars sang together when they first saw light upon the newly made
   earth, surely the angels in Heaven rejoiced even more when they saw
   light thus streaming upon the dark earth through men, who, in and of
   themselves, would only have increased the blackness and made the gloom
   more dense.

   God works by means of men whom He especially calls to His work and not
   as a rule without them. The hypocrite strives to get rid of the
   pastorate but he never can, for the Lord will ever continue to give
   pastors after His own heart to feed His people and all attempts made by
   the flock to dispense with these pastors will lead to leanness and
   poverty of soul. The outcry against the "one man ministry" comes not of
   God, but of proud self-conceit--of men who are not content to learn
   although they have no power to teach.

   It is the tendency of human nature to exalt itself which has raised up
   these disturbers of the peace of God's Israel, for they will not endure
   to submit themselves to the authorities which God has Himself
   appointed. They abhor the teachings of the Apostle, where he says, by
   the Spirit of God, "Obey them that have rule over you and submit
   yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give
   account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
   unprofitable to you."

   Brethren, I warn you, there is a spirit abroad which would pull down
   the men whom God Himself has raised up, that would silence those into
   whose mouths God has put the tongue of fire, that foolish men might
   prate according to their own will to the profit of no one and to their
   own shame. As for us, we shall, I trust, never cease to recognize that
   agency by which the Lord works mightily among us. We would check no
   ministry in the Church of God. We would but be too glad to see it more
   abundantly exercised. Would God that all the Lord's servants were
   Prophets!

   But we enter our solemn protest against that spirit which, under
   presence of liberty to all, sets aside the instrumentality by which the
   Lord especially works. He will have you still keep the fishermen to
   their nets and to their boats. And your new ways of catching fish
   without nets and saving souls without ministers, will never answer, for
   they are not of God. They have been tried and what has been the result
   of the trial? I know not a Church in existence that has despised
   instrumentality but it has come to an end within a few years either by
   schism or decay.

   Where upon the face of the earth is there a single Church that has
   existed fifty years where God's chosen instrumentality of ministry has
   been despised and rejected? "Ichabod!" is written upon their walls. God
   rejects them because they reject God's chosen way of working. Their
   attempts are flashes in the pan, meteoric lights, will-o'-the-wisps,
   swellings of proud flesh, bubbles of foam, here today and gone forever
   on the morrow.

   2. Again, in both our texts there is another Truth of God equally
   conspicuous, namely, that means of themselves are utterly unavailing.
   In the first case you hear the confession, "Master, we have toiled all
   the night and have taken nothing." In the last case you hear them
   answer to the question, "Children, have you no meat?" "No"--a sorrowful
   No. What was the reason of this? Were they not fishermen plying their
   special calling? Verily, they were no raw hands. They understood the
   work. Had they gone about the toil unskillfully? No. Had they lacked
   industry? No, they had toiled. Had they lacked perseverance? No, they
   had toiled all night.

   Was there a deficiency of fish in the sea? Certainly not, for as soon
   as the Master comes, there they are in large number. What, then, is the
   reason? Is it not because there is no power in the means of themselves
   apart from the presence of Christ? The Great Worker who does not
   discard the means would still have His people know that He uses
   instrumentality, not to glorify the instrument, but for the sake of
   glorifying Himself. He takes weakness into His hands and makes it
   strong, not that weakness may be worshipped, but that the strength may
   be adored which even makes weakness subservient to its might.

   Brethren, let us as a Church always keep this in mind, that without
   Christ we can do nothing. "Not by might, nor by power but by My Spirit,
   says the Lord." Put no dependence upon societies, upon committees, upon
   ministries, upon anything that we can do. Let us work as if it all
   depended upon us. But let us come to God depending upon Him, knowing
   for sure that it does not rest with us, but with Him alone. Let us send
   forth the missionaries to the heathen. Let us send forth our men into
   the dark streets and lanes of London. Let us scatter tracts. Let us
   distribute the Word of God. Let us send forth preachers by scores from
   our "School of the Prophets." But when this is done, let us not sit
   still and say, "Now it is all accomplished, good must come of it." No,
   Lord, unless Your blessing descend from on High, as well might we have
   done nothing, for no eternal results can follow.

   How often this drives me to my knees! The surprising work which God is
   doing in connection with this place lifts up my heart with joy. But
   then the fear lest it all should come to nothing for lack of His
   blessing casts my spirit to the very earth. You will remember, I dare
   say, that one Brother was moved, some time ago, to distribute a volume
   of the sermons preached here to every student in Oxford and Cambridge.
   After that had been done and some two hundred thousand sermons had been
   distributed, he then gave them to every member of Parliament, to every
   peer of the realm and to princes, kings and emperors of Europe. Having
   accomplished that work, he has another in hand of great magnitude.

   Dear Friends, as I think of these books traveling everywhere among high
   and low, the rich and poor, in all places of the land, my heart is
   glad. But then, if God withholds the blessing, as well had they never
   been born in the press and cir- culated by human hand. What good can
   they do? Let the net be ever so broad, ever so strong, and let it be
   ever so industriously cast into the sea, yet we shall toil all the
   night and take nothing unless the Master comes to bless the work.

   Let us, then, be always in prayer for the blessing. Let us remember
   that we have done nothing until we have prayed over what we have done.
   Let us consider that all the seed we have put into the ground is put
   there for worms to eat, unless we have dropped into the soil the
   preserving grain of prayer to keep that other grain alive. We shall
   have harvests if we wait on God for them, but after all our sowing, if
   we look to the soil, the seed, or the sower, we shall see nothing for
   our pains.

   3. Thirdly, there is clearly taught in both these miracles the fact
   that it is Christ's Presence that confers success. Christ sat in
   Peter's boat. It was His will that by a mysterious influence drew the
   fish to the net, as though He had a hook, a secret hook in each of
   their jaws. As though He could stop them in their sportive leaps and
   hurry them all to one common spot. It was His Presence on the dry land,
   when He spoke from off the shore to His toiling disciples out yonder
   and said, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship"--it was His
   Presence that drew the fish to the place where they were taken.

   Oh, Brethren, we must learn this--that it is Christ's Presence in the
   midst of the Church that is the Church's power--the shout of a King in
   the midst of her. It is the Presence of Christ's great representative,
   the Holy Spirit, that is to give the Church force. "I, if I am lifted
   up, will draw all men unto Me." There is the attraction. The Spirit
   gives the power and we must tarry until we get it. But when we have it,
   then we cannot preach in vain, for we become "a savor of life unto
   life" to those who hear. Christians, Christ's Presence with you must be
   your power. Be much in fellowship with Him. Catch much of His Spirit.
   Meditate much upon His sufferings. Keep close to His Person. And then,
   wherever you go, there shall be a power about you which even your
   adversaries shall be compelled to acknowledge.

   Oh that we had more of Christ's Presence in us as a Church! Lift up
   your hearts for it. If Christ is here at all, let us not grieve Him. "I
   charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up nor
   awake my love till He pleases." And if He is not here, let us rise from
   the bed of our sloth and go forth and seek Him, crying, "Oh You whom my
   soul loves, tell me where You feed, where You make Your flock to rest
   at noon!" And if you find Him, I charge you hold Him and let Him not go
   till you bring Him into your mother's house, into the chamber of her
   that bare you, even the Church of Christ. There will we hold Him, there
   will we embrace Him--and He shall show to us His love.

   4. In both instances the success which attended the instrumentality
   through Christ's Presence developed human weakness. We do not see human
   weakness more in non-success than in success. In the first instance, in
   the success you see the weakness of man, for the net breaks and the
   ships begin to sink and Simon Peter falls down with--"Depart from me
   for I am a sinful man, O Lord." He did not know so much about that till
   his boat was filled. But the very abundance of God's mercy made him
   feel his own nothingness.

   In the last case, they were scarcely able to draw the net because of
   the multitude of fishes. Brethren, if you or I would know to the
   fullest extent what utter nothings we are, if the Lord shall give us
   success in winning souls we shall soon find it out. As we see first
   one, and then another, and then scores and then hundreds, brought to
   the Lord Jesus, we shall say, "Who has begotten me these? How can such
   wonders be worked by me?" And we shall fall prostrate before the
   footstool of Sovereign Grace and confess that we are unworthy of such
   amazing favors.

   Let the Church spread, let her conquests be many, let her overrun whole
   provinces with her heavenly arms and instead of man becoming more
   famous, man shall sink lower and lower and it shall be more and more
   fully perceived that it is the Lord. Little works, such as have been
   common in our Churches for years, where twos and threes are added, are
   quite consistent with great self-congratulation, and so is utter
   barrenness. Mark the pompous carriage of many a fruitless preacher and
   see if it is not so.

   Let the Lord make bare His arm and the man humbles himself in the dust,
   for when hundreds are ingathered, this cannot be the minister, this is
   the finger of God. The man is forgotten, then, in the very abundance of
   his success and the Lord, alone, is magnified in that day. Oh that God
   would do in the Churches of England some great and stupendous works by
   all His ministers! Then would they discover their own weakness and then
   would the name of God be glorified!

   You frequently meet with the observation, if a man is successful in
   winning souls, "I am afraid he will grow proud: how we ought to pray
   that he may be kept humble!" Brethren, that is a very necessary prayer
   for anybody. But it is no more necessary for the man who is successful
   than for the unsuccessful one. In fact, it is an assumption of pride on
   any person's part to think that he has less need to pray against pride
   than any other man. Think not that when the Church prospers, it becomes
   necessarily proud. No, the very fullness of the boat makes it sink, and
   the very abundance of the miracle makes us cry out the more, "It is the
   Lord," for we feel that it could not have been of man, for it is out of
   man's reach to have accomplished such wonders.

   So far, then, there is a likeness running through the whole. Means must
   be used--means alone, unavailing--Christ's Presence gives the success.
   That success develops human weakness and leads to the exclamation--"It
   is the Lord."

   II. Having, then, shown the likeness, you will be still more interested
   in REMARKING THE DISSIMILARITY.

   Allow us to say in the commencement, that we think the first picture
   represents the Church of God as we see it. The second represents it as
   it really is. The first pictures to us, the visible, the second the
   invisible. Luke tells us what the crowd see. John tells us what Christ
   showed to His disciples, alone. The first is common truth which the
   multitude may receive, the next is special mystery revealed only to
   spiritual minds. Observe, then, carefully, the points of divergence.

   1. First, there is a difference in the orders given. In the first, it
   is, "Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught." In
   the second it is, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship." The
   first is Christ's order to every minister. The second is the secret
   work of His Spirit in the Word. The first shows us that the ministry is
   to fish anywhere and everywhere. All the orders that the Christian has,
   as to his preaching, is, "Launch out into the deep and let down your
   net." He is not to single out any particular character.

   He is to preach to everybody, sensible sinners and insensible sinners.
   He is to preach to the dead dry bones of the valley as well as to the
   living souls. He is not to look where the fish are, but just to throw
   the net in, doing as his Master tells him, "Go you into all the world
   and preach the Gospel to every creature." Those ministers who preach
   only to the elect should remember this. Our business is to include all
   sorts of fish and not to be particular about where we are, but just
   splash the net in. What if we are in town, or city, or village? What if
   we are among the rich or poor, learned or illiterate? What if we are
   among the debauched or immoral? We have nothing to do with that--our
   duty is the same, to "launch out into the deep, and let down the
   net"--that is all.

   Christ will find the fish--it is no business of ours. The secret truth
   is that when we are doing this, the Lord knows how to guide us, so that
   we, "cast the net on the right side of the ship." That is the secret
   and invisible work of the Spirit, whereby He so adapts our ministry,
   which is in itself general, that He makes it particular and special. We
   speak to all, and He speaks to some. We blow the trumpet, but only the
   bankrupt debtors hear it--only those who are truly of the Spirit of God
   know the joyful sound and rejoice therein. We cannot single them out,
   but God can. We thrust in the blessed loadstone of the Gospel, and that
   heavenly magnet has an affinity to some hearts which God has quickened,
   so that as many as were ordained unto eternal life believe.

   The Apostles preached to the crowd but the Lord God, the Holy Spirit,
   who had decreed the salvation of His chosen, sent the Word home with
   power to the chosen and separated ones. What a joy it is to think that
   we always have a picked congregation here, for the Lord has picked
   them! Though they are crowded together promiscuously--here the good,
   and there the bad, all sorts mingled and mixed together--yet God brings
   them in according to His eternal purpose and all the while there is a
   core of chosen souls inside the mass of the congregation to whom God is
   applying the Word. We cast the net, after all, on the right side of the
   ship and we do find it full.

   2. In the first instance you will clearly see that there is a distinct
   plurality. The fishermen have nets--in the plural. They have boats--in
   the plural. There is plurality of agency employed. Each man seems to
   come out distinctly. In the next case, it is one. There are many men
   but they are all in one boat. They unitedly drag the net and it is but
   one net-- there is no division, it is all one. Now, this is the visible
   and the invisible. To us, the means that God makes use of to bring
   sinners to Himself are various.

   Sometimes we are in one boat trying to catch all the fish we can. There
   is another boat over yonder and they are trying to do the same. We
   ought to consider them as being partners and whenever our boat gets too
   full, we should beckon to our partners in the other ship to come and
   help us. We ought not to look upon those Brethren who differ from us as
   though they were emptying the sea and competing against us. The more
   the merrier. The more men to do good, the more will the Lord's name be
   praised. I think, in many of our towns where some of our whining
   Brethren say that all good people should go to one Chapel, that it is
   far better to have three or four.

   I question whether the plurality of agency involved in denominations is
   not a great benefit and blessing. Instead of, in the slightest degree,
   standing out against my Brethren for carrying out their convictions, I
   praise them and look upon them as partners in another ship. Our
   denominational distinctions help to keep us awake--thus we stir one
   another up and do far more good in the world than would be the case if
   there were only a nominal Church. God would have the agency diverse.
   There must be several nets and there must be several fishermen and
   these fishermen in different boats.

   So far as we are able to see, there will always be a Paul and a
   Barnabas, who cannot get on together. There will always be outward
   divisions in the ministry. And I avow myself the advocate and lover of
   these things. As I said last Sunday, the thing called Sectarianism I do
   not disown but maintain.

   But let us look to the inward. In John they are all in one boat, all
   fishing together, all dragging one net. Ah, Brethren, this is what is
   really the fact. We do not see it, but all God's ministers are dragging
   one net and all God's Church is in one ship. Oh, I bless God for that
   sweet doctrine! It is no use striving after outward uniformity. We
   shall never see it. Neither the texture of the human mind nor the will
   of God require it. It is of no use to contend against the diversities
   which exist in the great visible Church. I do not know that these
   differences are evils.

   They are the natural results of man's finite character and must and
   will exist to the end of the chapter. It is the unity of the Spirit. It
   is unity in Christ Jesus. It is unity in love to one another that God
   would have us regard. Let us learn this unity from the fact, that after
   all, though we may look as if we differed, yet if we are God's
   ministers, there is only one ministry. If we are God's Church, there is
   only one Church in the world. There is only one spouse of the Lord
   Jesus. There is only one fold and one Shepherd. Though to our eyes it
   will always be so, two boats, or twenty boats--two nets, yes, fifty
   nets--yet to Him who sees all things better than we do, there is only
   one boat and one net. And they shall all, who are taken in that one
   net, be safely brought to shore.

   3. Thirdly, there is another difference. In the first case, how many
   fish were caught? The text says, "a great multitude." In the second
   case, a great multitude are taken, too, but they are all counted and
   numbered. "An hundred and fifty and three." Luke does not tell us how
   many were caught the first time, for there were some of them not worth
   the counting. But the second time, you will perceive the exact number
   is recorded, "an hundred and fifty and three."

   What was Peter's reason for counting them? We cannot tell. But I think
   I know why the Lord made him do it. It was to show us that though in
   the outward instrumentality of gathering the people into the Church,
   the number of the saved is to us a matter of which we know nothing
   definitely, yet secretly and invisibly the Lord has counted them even
   to the odd one. He knows well how many the Gospel net shall bring in.
   See where the Word is preached what a great multitude are brought in!
   Thousands, tens of thousands are added to the different Churches of
   Christ and make a profession of their faith.

   It were impossible to reckon all over Christendom how many have been
   taken in the outward net of the visible Church of Christ. But,
   Brethren, it is quite possible for it to be known of God how many shall
   be brought at last and how many now are in the invisible Church. He has
   counted them, foreordained their number, fixed them, settled them. The
   number, "an hundred and fifty and three" seems to me to represent a
   large definite number. They shall be in Heaven a number that no man can
   number, for God's elect are not few. But they shall be a number whom
   God can number, for "the Lord knows them that are His."

   They shall be a number certain and fixed, which shall neither be
   diminished nor increased but shall abide the same according to His
   purpose and will. Now, I, as a preacher, have nothing to do with
   counting fish. My business is with the great multitude. Splash goes the
   net again! Oh Master! You who have taught us to throw the net and bring
   in a multitude, guide into it the hundred and fifty and three!

   4. Yet again, notice another difference. The fish that were taken the
   first time appear to have been of all sorts. The net was broken and
   therefore, doubtless some of them got out again. There were some so
   little that they were not worth eating and doubtless were thrown away.
   "They shall gather the good into vessels and throw the bad away." In
   the second case, the net was full of great fishes. They were all great
   fishes, all good for eating, all the one hundred and fifty and three
   were worth keeping. There was not one little fellow to be thrown back
   into the deep again.

   The first gives us the outward and visible effect of the ministry. We
   gather into Christ's Church a great number. And there will always be in
   that number some that are not good, that are not really called of God.
   Sometimes we have Church meetings in which we have to throw the bad
   away. We have many blissful meetings where it is gathering in the
   fish--and what big hauls of fish has God given to us! Glory be to His
   name! But at other times we have to sit down and look our fish over,
   and there are some who must be thrown away--neither God nor man can
   endure them.

   Thus is it in the outward and visible Church. Let no man be surprised
   if the tares grow up with the wheat--it is the order of things, it must
   be so. Let none of us wonder if there are wolves in sheep's
   clothing--it always will be so. There was a Judas among the Twelve.
   There will be deceivers among us to the end of the chapter. Not so the
   invisible Church-- the Church within the Church--the holy of holies
   within the temple. In that there is none to throw away. No. The Lord
   who brought them into the net, brought the right sort in. He did not
   bring one hypocrite or apostate. And having brought them in to the
   exact number of one hundred and fifty and three, they cannot one of
   them get out again--but they are kept in that net, for that net does
   not break.

   They are in the secret invisible Church of Christ and they cannot get
   out of it, let them do what they may. They may even give up their
   nominal profession, and thus get out of the visible Church but they
   cannot give up their secret possession. They cannot escape from the
   secret and invisible Church and they shall all be kept there till the
   net is dragged to land and the whole hundred and fifty and three saved.

   6. Yet again, you notice in the first case the net broke and in the
   second case it did not. Now, in the first case, in the visible Church,
   the net breaks. My Brethren are always calling out "the net is broken!"
   No doubt it is a bad thing for nets to break. But you need not wonder
   at it. We cannot just now, when the net is full, stop to mend it. It
   will break. It is the necessary consequence of our being what we are
   that the net will break.

   What do I mean by this? Why, that instead of having some one
   denomination, we have twenty or thirty? The net is broken. I do not at
   all grieve over it. I believe it is what must be as long as we are
   flesh and blood. For until you get a set of perfect men, you never will
   have anything but these divisions. The net must break and will break.
   But glory be to God, the net does not break after all in reality, for
   though the visible Church may seem to be rent and torn to pieces, the
   invisible Church is one. God's chosen, God's called, God's quickened,
   God's blood-bought--they are one in heart and one in soul and one in
   spirit. Though they may wear different names among men, yet they still
   wear before God their Father's name written on their foreheads. And
   they are, and always must be one.

   You perceive, Brethren, that I do not advise you to strive for a
   nominal unity. The more you strive after that, the more divisions there
   will be. Certain Brethren left many of our denominations and formed,
   they said, a Church that should not be a sect. All they did was to make
   a sect the most sectarian of sects--the most narrow and most bitter of
   cliques, though containing some of the best men, some of the best
   Christians and the ablest writers of the times. You cannot make a
   visible uniformity, it is beyond your power--the net is broken.

   There now! Take care of the fish and leave the net alone, but still
   maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of per-fectness. Take care
   that you are not a schismatic in your heart, that you hold no heresy in
   your soul, that you are one with all them that love the Lord Jesus
   Christ in sincerity. And in this you will soon see that the net is not
   broken but that the saints are one. Ah, I bless God that when once we
   get with God's people--it does not matter what they are--we soon find
   the net is not broken. There are many a godly clergyman of the Church
   of England with whom I commune with the greatest joy and I have found
   the net was not broken.

   And in conversing with Brethren of all denominations, some who from
   doctrine, some who from sentiment stand wide as the poles asunder, I
   have still found and known that there was such a real and perfect
   harmony of heart that the net was not broken. I do not believe that
   charity would ever have had such perfect work in Christ's Church if it
   had not been for our being divided into tribes, like the twelve tribes
   of old. It is no charity for me to love a Brother who thinks as I
   think--I cannot very well help it. But for me to love a dear Brother
   who differs from me in some points--why there is exercise and room for
   my charity!

   And as God has left trials and troubles to exercise faith, I believe He
   has left us in many doctrinal difficulties on purpose--to exercise our
   love till the day shall come when we shall all grow to the stature of
   perfect men in Christ Jesus. The net is not broken, Brethren. Do not
   believe it, and when you read about this denomination, and that, do not
   be grieved at these names and tribes, but rather, thank God for them.
   Remember, that is the visible Church and the net is broken. But there
   is an invisible Church where the net is not broken--where we are one in
   Christ and must be one forever.

   There are several other points of difference but I think we have hardly
   time to enlarge upon them. I will only hint at them. In the first case,
   which is the visible Church, you see the human weakness becomes the
   strongest point. There is the boat ready to sink, there is the net
   broken, there are the men all out of heart, frightened, amazed and
   begging the Master to go away. In the other case it is not so at all.
   There is human weakness but still they are made strong enough. They
   have no strength to spare, as you perceive, but still they are strong
   enough, the net does not break, the ship goes slowly to land dragging
   the fish.

   And then, lastly, Simon Peter pulls the fish to shore. Strong he must
   have been. They were just strong enough to get their fish to shore. So
   in the visible Church of Christ you will often have to mourn over human
   weakness--but in the invisible Church, God will make His servants just
   strong enough--just strong enough to drag their fish to shore. The
   agencies, means, instrumentalities--shall have just sufficient force to
   land every elect soul in Heaven--that God may be glorified.

   Then, notice, in the visible Church, they launched out into the deep.
   In the second case, it says they were not far from the shore, but a
   little way. So today our preaching seems to us to be going out into the
   great stormy deep after fish. We appear to have a long way to reach
   before we shall bring these precious souls to land. But in the sight of
   God we are not far from shore. And when a soul is saved, it is not far
   from Heaven. To us there are years of temptation and trial and
   conflict. But to God, the Most High, it is finished--"it is done." They
   are saved--they are not far from shore.

   In the first case, the disciples had to forsake all and follow Christ.
   In the second, they sat down to feast with Him at the dainty banquet
   which He had spread. So in the visible Church today we have to bear
   trial and self-denial for Christ, but glory be to God, the eye of faith
   perceives that we shall soon drag our net to land and then the Master
   will say, "come and dine." And we shall sit down and feast in His
   Presence, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of God.

   III. The time is gone and I close by NOTICING ONE AMONG MANY LESSONS
   WHICH THE TWO NARRATIVES IN COMMON SEEM TO TEACH. In the first case,
   Christ was in the ship. Oh, blessed be God, Christ is in His

   Church, though she launch out into the deep! In the second case, Christ
   was on the shore. Blessed be God, Christ is in Heaven. He is not here,
   but He has risen. He has gone up on High for us. But whether He is in
   the Church, or whether He is on the shore in Heaven, all our night's
   toiling shall, by His Presence, have a rich reward.

   That is the lesson. Mother, will you learn it? You have been toiling
   long for your children. It has been night with you as yet. They give no
   evidence of Divine Grace. Rather they give many signs of sin and they
   grieve your spirit. Your night's toiling shall have an end. You shall
   at last cast the net on the right side of the ship. Sunday school
   teacher, you have been diligently laboring long and with but little
   fruit. Be not discouraged, the Master will not let you work in vain. In
   due season you shall reap if you faint not. And as these disciples had
   a great sea harvest, so shall you have a harvest of souls.

   Minister, you have been plowing some barren rock and as yet no joyful
   sheaves have made your heart glad. You shall, doubtless, "Come again,
   rejoicing, bringing your sheaves with you." And you, O Church of God,
   travailing for souls, meeting daily in prayer, pleading with men that
   they will come to Christ, what if they are not saved yet? The morning
   comes, the night is far spent, and the Master, Himself shall soon
   appear. And though He may not find faith on the earth, yet His advent
   shall bring to His Church the success for which she has waited--such
   success that as a woman remembers no more her travail because a man is
   born into the world--so shall the Church remember no more her toils,
   her efforts and her prayers, because Christ's kingdom has come and His
   will is done on earth even as it is in Heaven.

   Work, dear Friends! If there are any of you that are not working, begin
   now. If there are any of you not saved as yet, the Lord grant that when
   the Word is preached, you may be caught in it as in a net. We do throw
   it out once this morning. We hope to throw it again this evening.
   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved," for "he that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved and he that believes not shall
   be damned."

   Flee to Christ! Escape from the wrath to come! May the Spirit apply
   that Word to you, and lead you to the place where high on Calvary with
   bleeding hands and feet the Savior dies! One look at Him and you are
   saved. Look, Sinner, and live! God save you, for Christ's sake! Amen.

                           The Portion Of The Ungodly

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 13, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Behold, they shall be as stubble. The fire shall burn them. They shall
   not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a
   coal to be warmed by, nor a fire to sit before."

   Isaiah 47:14.

   THIS text is part of a terrible description of God's judgment upon
   Babylon and Chaldea. The Prophet had clearly written out the indictment
   of the Lord against that tyrannical people, and having proved their
   guilt he pronounces their sentence. He accused them of showing no mercy
   to the inheritance of the Lord which, in His wrath, He had given into
   their hands. He charges them with pride and boastfulness, for Chaldea
   had said in her heart, "I am and there is none beside me." And Babylon
   had boasted, "I shall be a lady forever. I shall see no sorrow."

   He testifies against their over-boldness and presumption. For they were
   given to pleasures and lived carelessly, expecting no ill. Thus said
   the Prophet, speaking in the name of the Lord, "You have trusted in
   your wickedness: you have said, None sees me. Your wisdom and your
   knowledge, it has perverted you. And you have said in your heart, I am
   and none else beside me." On account of these iniquities the
   destruction of Chaldea and Babylon was to be sudden, terrible and
   complete.

   They were to be so utterly destroyed, that there should not be one
   single comfortable rejection connected with their state. There should
   be a fire to consume but none to warm at. The burning should not be as
   when wood crackles in the flame, when glowing ashes or a charred log
   may be left, but they should be as stubble, utterly consumed, without
   vestige or remembrance. How to the very letter this has been fulfilled
   let the modern discoveries of our great travelers tell.

   We want no better evidence of the truthfulness and Divinity of
   Scripture than that which is furnished by prophecies which have been
   fulfilled in lands concerning which we had no knowledge until of late.
   In the good Providence of God there have been dug out from mounds of
   rubbish and heaps of decayed matter, slabs and stones, bearing in their
   carvings and inscriptions, the most wonderful proofs what the Lord has
   said and has fulfilled--what He has spoken has come to pass. O virgin
   daughter of Babylon! You have been made to sit on the ground. There is
   no throne--O daughter of the Chaldeans! You are no more tender and
   delicate, but your nakedness is uncovered and your shame is seen. Sit
   silently and get into darkness, O daughter of Chaldea, for you shall no
   more be called the lady of kingdoms.

   It is a truth beyond dispute, that God's justice is not partial. That
   the description of the destruction which He awards to one class of
   sinners is a most fair picture of what He will do with others, for God
   has two or three ways of dealing with men in His justice. He has not
   many different weights and measures, for these things are an
   abomination unto the Lord. He lays righteousness to the line and
   judgment to the plummet and He awards vengeance unto impenitent men by
   an established and an invariable rule. So, then, the ruin of Chaldea is
   to us, today, a representation and metaphorical description of the
   destruction which shall surely come upon impenitent sinners in that day
   when the Lord comes out of His place to judge His enemies and to rid
   Himself of His adversaries.

   It is with great trembling of heart that I come to this subject this
   morning. I have preached to you, lo, these many months in this
   Tabernacle and I have delighted most to lift up my Master's Cross and
   to speak of the sufficiency of His blood and of the fullness and
   freeness of His Divine Grace. But there are times when the Lord's hand
   lies upon us, and we cannot refuse to speak of His terrible things in
   judgment. I feel today somewhat like the Apostle when he said, "Knowing
   therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men . . . as though God did
   beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's place, be you reconciled to
   God."

   We believe that the Lord would not have said so much about the terrible
   things of His Law and justice in Scrip-ture--for He has said more about
   them than any other subject, except the Cross--if it had not been that
   there is a healthy use to be made of the vengeance which the Lord
   executes upon the wicked. It will be both for the benefit of the
   righteous and for the awakening of the ungodly, sometimes to thunder
   out the sentence of the Lord. Be it, therefore, known unto you, O sons
   of men, that Ebal and Gerizim still stand, both the blessing and the
   curse--and either the one or the other must be yours.

   To look at our text at first sight, the figures seem contradictory, for
   the first metaphor is, "They shall be as stubble. The fire shall burn
   them. They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame."
   But the next figure is apparently opposite to it--"It shall not be a
   coal to be warmed by, nor a fire to sit before." We shall first take
   the first figure and then the second. And thirdly, we shall close by
   endeavoring to dwell upon that important word with which the verse
   begins, which is put there like a hand in the margin to draw our
   attention to it, put there as a sort of signal hung out from Heaven to
   tell us that there is something here upon which we ought to meditate
   with attention--I mean the word "Behold"!

   I. With reference to the FIRST SENTENCE. You will see in reading it
   over that one of the most striking thoughts which it conveys to the
   mind is this, that the punishment of the wicked will be easily
   inflicted. "They shall be as stubble." Nothing can be more easy to
   kindle than stubble when it is fully dry. Strike the match and the
   whole is on a blaze, for it bears within itself the materials of
   conflagration. So shall it be with impenitent sinners. It shall not be
   hard for God to visit them with vengeance, for they bear in their own
   hearts the material of their punishment.

   Oh, ungodly and impenitent Man, there is that in yourself today which,
   left alone and permitted to ripen, will bring Hell upon you. We read in
   Scripture of the worm that dies not--that worm may be bred in the
   corruption of the sinner's lusts. We read of the fire that never shall
   be quenched--that fire will find its fuel in the hearts of lost
   spirits. We read of the pit that has no bottom--sin has dug a pit for
   itself of fathomless depth. Sinner, the Lord needs not to forge huge
   chains of iron, or build cells of darkness. He shall find in sinners
   the means of their punishment. He needs not to make tormentors for
   you--you shall be your own executioner.

   From no bitter herbs need He distil your draught of woe--you yourself
   shall mingle the cup which you shall drink. The racks of torture and
   the whips of torment your own soul shall make. Hear me, Man, you have
   in yourself the power of memory, and that power shall become a vehicle
   of sorrow to you. Memory shall look back upon all your past sins and
   each of these, though now they seem to you to be glossy as the scales
   of the serpent, shall sting you and infuse into your veins a worse
   poison than the viper ever knew. Your memory shall recall the pleasures
   which you did once enjoy, but from which you are banished forever.

   Your memory shall remind you of the warnings you did once receive and
   of the loving invitations which sounded in your ears. When it is all
   over with you, your memory shall be stronger than it is now. You shall
   have abundant time to remember every circumstance of your ruin. And
   your memory, enlarged and strengthened, shall bring up the record of
   every neglected Sunday, of every secret sin, yes, of those forgotten
   words of profanity, those secret iniquities which have been buried deep
   by time, but which shall be disinterred by the hand of eternity.

   Even now, at the very recollection of your sin, your cheek reddens with
   shame. But when memory gets a voice that will be heard, then shall you,
   indeed, become pale and your knees shall knock together with fear. The
   voice which says, "Son, remember," is as terrible as the pouring out of
   the vials of the wrath of Almighty God. You have, besides your memory,
   a conscience--a conscience which you have strived to silence. But, even
   drugged and gagged as it is, it sometimes makes you feel unhappy. When
   conscience smote the heart of Judas, you remember, he went out and
   hanged himself. But even the conscience of Judas was not so awake as
   will be the understanding and judgment of the sinner when condemned
   forever.

   You will then find, Sinner, that you cannot mitigate the guilt of sin.
   You will then see sin in its true colors. You will not then be so apt
   at making excuses for it. The hand of truth shall rend all those rags
   away. You will find, then, that conscience will not be trifled with as
   it is now. Now you try to make it hold the scales with an unjust hand,
   but then it will deliberately award you the due reward of your deeds.
   O, Man! Your memory and your conscience shall be as two great
   millstones grinding you to powder, or as two contending winds which
   shall with their tempestuous strivings break you in pieces, as the
   ships of Tarshish are broken by the north wind.

   Then, added to your memory, and to your conscience, there shall come
   your increased knowledge. You know enough now to leave you without
   excuse--but then your knowledge shall increase so as to leave you
   without pretense of apology. You shall then perceive the craft of the
   Tempter who deluded you. You shall then see the blackness and the
   filthiness of sin as you do not see it now. Then shall you understand
   the greatness and the goodness of the God whom you have despised. You
   shall then discern the glory of the Heaven which you have lost. You
   shall then begin to get an idea of that eternity which shall roll over
   your head forever. Your knowledge shall swell--your mind shall be
   strengthened. You shall grow. You shall have time enough for
   development.

   And all this increased light shall be but an increase of pain to your
   eyes, and all this increase of wisdom shall be but a fresh source of
   misery for your impenitent spirit. Believe me, Man, I speak not thus
   that I may agitate you merely for the sake of causing you pain. God
   forbid I should do that. But oh, if I can but arouse you. If but some
   thunder-clap may awake you before you have slept yourself into Hell, I
   shall be but too happy, and you will not think my words too rough if
   they are the means of bringing you to the knowledge of Christ and of
   eternal life.

   Why, do you not know, Man, that your sin, itself, without anything
   besides, will be enough to make you as stubble to the flame? What is
   sin on earth? Is it not the mother of misery? Does a man ever do wrong
   without smarting for it? And those sins which are committed by the
   body, do they not entail, even on earth, their own punishment and doom?
   Then if sin in the bud here is bitter, what will it be when it is
   full-blown? Sin bears its punishment in its own heart! Besides, think
   of your companions. Shut up fifty drunkards and profane men together
   and would they not soon make a Hell for themselves without any
   interposition of Divine power?

   What will it be when they are bound up in bundles. When the tens of
   thousands of those who obey not Christ shall find themselves in their
   own place? Oh, they will be as the flesh in the seething-pot, as the
   oil in the cauldron, as the fire wood in the flame, as the coals in the
   fire. They shall be tormenting and be tormented--exciting one another
   to worse sins and direr blasphemies, and so increasing in each other
   the horror of the great darkness which results from separation from God
   and enmity against Him. You shall find, Sinner, that God needs send no
   devils to torment you--your sins shall be devils enough, your
   companions in the pit shall be Fiends enough. Your memory, your
   conscience and your knowledge, shall add such fuel to the flame that
   you shall, indeed, be as stubble cast into the fire.

   That is the first Truth of God clearly set forth in the text. But
   secondly. And solemnly, there is also another very plainly taught,
   namely, that this punishment shall be most searching and terrible. The
   metaphor of fire is used in Scripture because it is that which, of all
   things causes the most pain and is the most searching and trying. One
   would suppose that death by fire must be one of the most painful that
   can be endured, and the pangs of burning reach to the very inwards of
   human life. The judgment of God is quick and powerful, it shall search
   your inwards. It shall reach the secret parts of your belly. There
   shall be no part of your frame or of your heart that shall be free from
   its inroads.

   As fire consumes and so reaches to the very essence of things, so shall
   the wrath to come reach to the very essence and subsistence of the
   soul. It shall be utter and overwhelming destruction which shall
   totally consume everything like joy and hope. It shall be a penetrating
   and a piercing of the very veins and the marrow of the man, and he
   shall not be able to escape. In Scripture this wrath to come is
   sometimes spoken of as the second death. Imagine a man dying, dying in
   pangs and then rising again to die again and so continually dying and
   yet living--expiring and yet breathing--perishing and yet existing.
   Being dissolved but yet being still in the body. You have now before
   you, then, the Biblical view of punishment--"the second death."--

   "To linger in eternal death, Yet death forever fly."

   O Soul, there are no words that human eloquence can ever find, however
   dreadful, that can reach the thousandth part of this great argument! No
   language that was ever uttered by the sternest Prophet, no dreadful
   denunciations that ever flowed from the most burning lips, could ever
   attain to the tremendous terror of the wrath to come. I know men say of
   God's preachers that at times they speak too harshly. Sirs, we cannot
   speak half harshly enough. We tell you again, even weeping, that our
   poor feeble words cannot portray your danger!

   We cannot ourselves even feel the danger as we would wish. But oh, if
   our lips had language, if we could but speak as sometimes we feel, we
   would move you till you should neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep, until
   you had sought and found a refuge in the wounds of Christ. But we are
   so dull, or else your hearts are so hard, that when we speak, we are
   like men who throw stones against a wall, and the stones come back upon
   us. Oh that instead we might be this morning like the man who drew the
   bow at a venture, that the arrow may find a place in the joints of your
   harness, where your heart may be wounded with the arrows of the King!

   Thirdly, when we look at our text we see most evidently that this
   destruction will be most inevitable, for the express words of the
   Prophet are, "They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the
   flame." There is hope now. There shall be no hope then. There is a new
   and living way now. There shall be no way then. The gate of mercy is
   open now. It shall be fast bolted forever then. There is a ladder which
   reaches from earth to Heaven, but there is no ladder which reaches from
   Hell to Heaven. There is a great gulf fixed so that they who would pass
   from them to us cannot, neither could we go to them even if we should
   wish to venture there--

   "Fixed is their everlasting state, Could man repent, it is then too
   late; Justice has closed mercy's door, And God's long-suffering is no
   more."

   It is inevitable, we say. How can they avoid it? Man, have you strength
   to fight with the Most High? Can you defy the Eternal God to battle and
   go forth in your weakness to meet the Lord God of Hosts? If so, then
   might you hope to escape, but then you would be God yourself, and
   Jehovah would be no God. But you are a puny man--a tooth-ache makes you
   tremble. A little feather in the wind makes you shake. You are a dying
   man. You have not power to keep yourself in life--your breath is in
   your nostrils and wherein are you to be accounted of?

   Certain is it, then, that by your own power you will not be able to
   escape out of the power of the flame. And can you escape by your wit?
   Why, you have not wit enough now to fly to Christ! You have not wisdom
   enough now to look to Him. Where, then, could you find the wisdom that
   could invent another plan of salvation? The way of salvation by Christ
   is the only one that even God's wisdom has revealed to us. No! Fool,
   you can never find another, nor in Hell will you ever have the comfort
   of the hope of another--for there shall you understand that no other
   foundation can man lay than that which is laid--Jesus Christ the
   Righteous.

   Or do you think to escape from God by hiding from His Presence? Ah,
   where will you go? Could you seek the heart of the mountains? God is
   there, for He, by His strength, sets them fast. If you could dive into
   the depths of the sea to seek its deep cavernous recesses, even there
   would He reach you, for His hand dug the channels of the ocean and the
   strength of the sea is His, also. Would you try to escape behind the
   clouds of darkness?--

   "Darkness and light in this agree; Great God, they're both alike to
   You; Your eyes can reach Your foes as soon Through midnight shades as
   blazing noon."

   Or would you hope to fly beyond the range of the known universe? Man,
   He is there, for He fills all things. And as it was said of the world
   in the days of the Caesars--that it was only one great prison for the
   offender, so that go where he might, Caesar would track him--so shall
   you find the universe, even could you escape from your prison, to be
   but one great den where the Eternal Eye should see you and the Eternal
   Hand should reach you. No, there is no escape, there is no deliverance,
   there is no means of avoiding sin's penalty when life is over. It is
   "Escape from the wrath to come" today. But then escape shall be a thing
   unknown.

   These three Truths of God stand clearly enough in our text--that the
   punishment of the wicked will be easily inflicted, that it will be most
   dreadful in its character, and that it will be most inevitable. Do I
   speak to any here who say they do not believe it? Well, Sir, I might
   only say this much to you--you profess to be a Christian nominally, do
   you not? And you, you say, live in a Christian land. Now, if so, if you
   do really believe this Book to be the Word of God, then what can you
   say in denial of a future judgment? You must believe in the wrath to
   come and in the general judgment.

   If not, turn Turk--say so at once--turn infidel. Or something of that
   kind. But never again pretend to be called a Christian and live in a
   Christian land, and to be one of a Christian people. Never profess
   that, while you object to that which is one of the fundamental Truths
   of Revelation--one of these great things about which there can be no
   dispute among those who receive this Book as being a Revelation from
   God. But, you will tell me again that you think I speak too harshly of
   it. O Sirs, not half so harshly as Isaiah! Not half so plaintively as
   Jeremiah or Ezekiel, nor in such telling words as did my blessed
   Master!

   The Lord Jesus, though the most loving of spirits, was the most stern
   of preachers. In His sermons, while there is everything that could melt
   and woo, there is no lack of the great and terrible thunderbolt, and
   the sounding forth of wrath to come and the judgment which must await
   the impenitent. But again, you will say to me, why do you speak like
   that?

   Why not dwell upon more pleasant themes? Because, as the Lord, my God,
   lives, before whom I stand, I wish to be free of the blood of all men.

   What is it to win your applause today? Or, what is it to gain your
   censure? Think you, Sirs, that the breath of your applause is that on
   which we live? Fancy you that your opinion of our ministry is anything
   to us? No, not if God has sent us. If we are but what you may think us
   to be--impostors to please you--then, indeed, we should eschew all such
   subjects as these. We should be silent upon the hard sayings and only
   prophesy smooth things. If we cared for popularity and such like, we
   should put these doctrines behind and cry, "Peace, peace and sew
   pillows to your armholes." But, as God has sent us and as we know we
   must give an account of our ministry, we tell you that if you perish,
   it shall not be for want of warning.

   And if you must go down to Hell, it shall be with your eyes open. If
   you will have your sins, you shall know that you must have the
   punishment with them. And if you will reject Christ, and if you will
   despise Him, it shall be with this fact before you--that you did it
   willfully--knowing what you did, knowing that those who do such things
   shall not escape the just vengeance of God. Oh, may God but convince
   you by the spirit of His Truth and the solemn realities of the judgment
   and the wrath to come, and we shall need no excuse and no apology. But
   you would rather think us to be false traitors to your souls if we did
   not boldly speak on these matters.

   II. But our text now changes its figure and therefore we, still keeping
   to the same subject, change our mode of address. "Thus says the Lord,
   It shall not be a coal to be warmed by, nor a fire to sit before." By
   which is meant that there shall be nothing in Hell that can give the
   sinner a moment's comfort. Nothing. Let me picture him there. The text
   says, "Behold," as though it were a thing to be seen with the eyes, and
   to be heard with the ears. Behold you, then, for a moment, a spirit
   cast away from God and receiving the due reward of its deeds. That
   spirit, we say, has not a coal to warm itself, nor a single thing that
   can yield it a ray of joy.

   The soul lifts its eye to Heaven. There are the glorified spirits
   before the Throne of God--but the sight of Heaven affords no comfort to
   the lost in Hell, for they say, "See what glory we have lost! What
   transcendent joys we have missed! What bliss we renounced--that we
   might have the mirth of an hour and the misery of eternity!" And as
   they look up, they shall see some of their old companions there. Some
   who were once sinners like themselves, but who have sought for mercy
   through the precious blood and having washed their robes in it, stand
   before the Throne of God.

   And then the lost ones shall wring their hands and curse the day in
   which they were born, that they should have rejected the mercy which
   they heard proclaimed in their hearing, while others were saved. And
   this shall tend to make the contrast of their condition appear the more
   dreadful. And then they will see there the poor tried saints of the
   Lord whom they were likely to mock at and they will say, "Ah, there is
   the man whom we despised. He reigns, and we suffer-- Lazarus, the
   beggar that lay at our gate full of sores and was licked of the dogs,
   is there in Abraham's bosom--and we are tormented in this flame."

   Soul, the thought of Heaven shall fan the flames of Hell. The sense of
   the glory of the righteous shall depress the spirit with a double woe.
   And at the thought of what you have lost, there shall ever be in your
   ears a sound, "How are you fallen, O you son of the morning! How are
   you cast down from Heaven and brought into the depths of Hell"! Nor
   when the spirit turns its eye around upon Hell itself shall it see any
   reason for comfort there. I know there are some who say, "Well, if I am
   lost, there will be many more that will be." Ah, but the multitude of
   the damned will be no consolation to the damned.

   The more there are, the more wretched shall they be. For maybe, O
   Reprobate, as you shall cast your eye around, you will meet the eyes of
   the woman whom you did lead astray and she will curse you to your face.
   Perhaps, Drunkard, as you are in your musings, you will see the lad
   whom you first took to the ale-house and taught to be a beast like
   yourself! Knaves, there shall you meet your partners in your trade!
   There shall the ungodly see eyes which shall look upon them glaring
   like eyes of fire, which they can never avoid--the eyes of those whom
   they duped and deceived and misled.

   Most horrible of all must be the position of the professed minister of
   Christ who did not preach the Gospel, or who never cared for the souls
   of men. Oh, if such a lot should ever be mine! Think of the million
   eyes of those in Hell, every one of them darting flames of fire at the
   false preacher who did not care for their souls! Better to be a devil
   than to be a preacher who was untrue to his Master. Better to sink to
   Hell as a prostitute, or as a thief, than to go to perdition as a
   clergyman or a minister who has not preached the Word of God with all
   his might! There shall be no comfort in the company that they find
   there--neither Heaven nor Hell shall yield them a coal to be warmed by.

   Nor, indeed, will they be able to find any comfort in themselves, nor
   in their thoughts. Now, we sometimes find men who get comfort to
   themselves out of the doctrines of God's Gospel. I have known a man
   come up to this House of Prayer and under some soul-searching sermon,
   he has been alarmed. He has gone home and sat with his finger upon his
   brow in thought, for a little season, and said, "You almost persuaded
   me to be a Christian." His heart seemed ready to break, but at last he
   has risen up and said, "If I am to be damned, I shall be damned, and if
   I am to be saved I shall be saved," and he has made the doctrine of
   predestination a coverlet in which he might wrap himself and sleep
   comfortably.

   Souls, you shall not be able to do that then. In the world to come, no
   doctrine will be able to yield you a moment's comfort. Instead of it,
   your thoughts shall be a case of knives, cutting and piercing your
   souls, and every Truth of God you have ever known, yes, and every
   falsehood that you have once believed, shall be spikes upon the bed
   where you seek to find some peace. Indeed, there is never any real joy
   to the sinner even here, when his mind is awake, and certainly there
   will be none hereafter. Why, the greatest torture to which you could
   put some men would be to make them think. How do some of our men live?
   They drink hard and go to bed drunk.

   They wake up in the morning and they are very low and miserable. And
   then they must have a little drink again to lift their spirits up and,
   when they have lost their reason, they get happy. But if they would sit
   down and think awhile over their present estate, they would kill
   themselves. This is how many an one has been made a suicide. When they
   have had a moment's sober thought, they have looked at themselves. And
   if this on earth has brought men to the halter and to the knife, what
   will it do in Hell when, forever, forever and forever, their thoughts
   shall revolve, and revolve and revolve again upon sin and its
   punishment, upon Divine Grace despised, upon mercy rejected--upon an
   angry God and upon the all-devouring wrath which has come forth from
   His Presence?

   But again--the sinner shall certainly find no comfort in God. Mark you,
   if the sinner could say there what he now says here, he would have
   comfort in God. For now he says, "If God is to treat me thus in the
   world to come, it will be unjust." Ah, you will not think so then, for
   this shall be the sting of it all--"I deserve it. I deserve it. I
   brought this on myself!" You may mutter now about the hardness of God,
   and call Him a cruel taskmaster--but when your better sense gets the
   upper hand, as it will do--then you will be compelled against your will
   to acknowledge that He is not too severe. That He is not too hard with
   you. Oh, if the lost spirits in Hell could but believe God to be
   unjust, their pains would cease!

   But it is the conviction that He is just, and that every pang and every
   throe they have willfully brought upon themselves by despising Him and
   running in a false way--it is that conviction which will be the Hell of
   Hell. No, more, Sin-ner--when you are there, you will not be able to
   say that God has broken a single promise that He ever made to you. If
   there is a soul in Hell that could say, "I sought the Lord but He would
   not be found of me"--if he could say--"I did trust Christ but He did
   not save me." If he could say, "I did seek and pray, but He would not
   hear"--if he could say, "I did humble myself and leave my sin. I did
   come to Him and say, Jesus, Savior, pity me. Have mercy upon me through
   your precious blood." If he could say that and then add, "And yet I was
   not saved"--then that man would have no Hell, because he would always
   have some excuse.

   But there is not one among you that will ever have an excuse. If you
   are lost, it will be because you did not pray. And if you perish, it
   will be because you did not repent. And if you are cast away, it will
   be because you would not believe in Christ. You shall find no comfort
   in any broken promises. But those which are now the hope and joy of the
   penitent, shall then be your dread and fear. Moreover, you sometimes
   comfort yourselves with the thought that you cannot help it, that it
   must be so, and therefore you are comforted in it. But you will get no
   comfort in that thought in the world to come, for then you will clearly
   perceive that your sin was willfully undertaken, that you did it to
   please yourself, that you followed your own wayward, headstrong will,
   instead of bowing to the will of God.

   O! There is nothing in God, nothing in His promises, nothing in His
   threats, nothing in His Word, which will at the Last Great Day yield a
   coal for the sinner to be warmed by, or a fire by which he can sit
   before. It will be black, black despair, and not a solitary ray of
   light shall come from God to that soul.

   But further, the sinner shall then find no comfort in the past. I know
   he will look back upon his past joys but what will he say of them? He
   will call himself ten-thousand fools to think that for such little
   paltry joys as those, he should have lost eternal bliss. The drunkard
   will doubtless remember his cups but it will be to call himself an
   idiot to think for a little drink and the sweet excitement of his
   palate for an hour, he should have damned himself to all eternity. Ah,
   and the very thought of those enjoyments will act as a foil to set
   forth the present state in which he is. He will have the sin without
   the pleasure of it. The dregs but not the wine. The bitterness, the
   worm-wood, and the gall, but not the froth upon the cup.

   That he has had in time, but now he has to drink the bitterness to all
   eternity. As he looks back, instead of comfort, O Sirs, what agony the
   past will give him! Should I be so unhappy as to have in my
   congregation this morning one man who shall at last perish, I do not
   doubt that this present assembly will flash before his eyes. Ah, then
   he will say, "I remember how the preacher spoke. Whatever he did not
   say, he did warn me to flee from the wrath to come. However feebly he
   put it, I ought not to have thought of that, but I should have
   remembered the Truth and my interest in it."

   Oh, by these tears which these eyes must shed and by the emotions which
   this heart does feel for your soul's salvation, I plead with you--do
   not remain in such a state that when you die you will have to say, "He
   cared more for me than I cared for myself. He thought more of my
   conversion than I ever thought of it, and he wished more to see me
   brought to eternal life than I have ever done." Oh, let not the past
   become so bitter as this! Young man, shall your mother's tears and your
   father's prayers, when they sought to bring you to Christ, make a part
   of the bitter remembrances of eternity? And you, my dear Hearers, who
   sit here constantly, must these seats cry out against you? Must this
   House of Prayer bear witness against you? Must I appear at the great
   bar of God, and say "My Lord, it is just. I did warn them. They were
   prayed for. They were wept over. They were wooed. As a mother loves her
   children, so has my soul loved them"?

   Must it be so? God forbid! But it must, except you repent. "Except a
   man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." And what remains
   then, but that he must be driven from the Presence of God to the place
   where hope can never come? God have mercy on you, for if He does not,
   you shall find not a coal to warm you in the recollections of the past.

   Then when that soul is lost, it certainly shall find no coal to warm
   itself by in its condition in the present. Now, ungodly men get some
   degree of comfort from the very ruin of their state. I mean this--some
   of them are presumptuous. They say, "What do I care? I will defy all
   this. Who is the Lord that I should obey His voice?" And this gives
   some sort of comfort here. But you will not be able to face it out thus
   in eternity. The most brazen among the ungodly crew shall then hide his
   face for shame--like Belshazzar, his knees shall knock together and his
   loins be loosed. Then shall the stouthearted fail, and the soul of the
   mighty shall be bowed down.

   Ignorance, too, gives many men comfort here. They do not know their
   state and so they are at peace. But you will have no ignorance
   then--you will know, even as you are known--so that this also shall be
   taken away. Here also stupidity often gives men peace. They will not
   feel. You may hammer them with the Law but they are not moved. You may
   preach as though you would move a heart of stone, but they are not
   moved. Ah, but hearts of stone shall be no more in Hell. They shall be
   hearts of flesh to suffer, though not hearts of flesh to repent. Then
   the stout heart shall be taken away and the proud spirit shall quail,
   so that there shall be nothing in the present condition of the lost
   that can yield them any comfort.

   Nor will there be anything to comfort them in their future condition.
   They may look on through the long vista of the eternal ages and never
   see the shadow of a hope. Forever, forever, forever--wave after
   wave--stream after stream of sorrow. Forever, forever, forever! Oh, it
   would make holiday in Hell, if it could be proved that the pains were
   not eternal! But it stands, "These shall go away into everlasting
   punishment. Where their worm dies not and their fire is not quenched."
   No hope! When a woman has no hope, we wonder not that she seeks the
   cold river. When a man has no hope, we wonder not that he is taken to
   the asylum as a lunatic. But when the soul has no hope, then it will be
   death and madness combined forever, forever, forever!

   III. And now our text bids us "BEHOLD." Therefore I pray you, Beloved,
   turn not away your eyes from this meditation. Children of God, behold
   it. It will make you grateful--

   "Oh, were it not for Grace Divine, This case so dreadful had been
   mine."

   Does not the thought of the misery from which you have escaped make you
   love your Savior? And oh, Christian, will it not make you love poor
   sinners, too? Do you not feel as if you wanted to be doing something to
   pluck them as brands from the burning? Knowing the terrors of the Lord,
   do you not wish to be the saviors of men? Wake, you sleepers! Woe unto
   you if you can think of these things and still be quiet! "Woe unto them
   that are at ease in Zion," who can see men perish without doing
   anything to rescue them! Woe unto you! Woe unto you! How can you be the
   servants of God?

   But especially, you that are unconverted, the text says, "Behold." It
   is a gloomy subject for you to think upon, but better to think of it
   now, than to think of it forever. Better to weep the tears of penitence
   than the tears of despair, and better the pangs of conviction, than the
   pangs of condemnation. Better for a little season to lose your mirth
   and your merriment to get Heaven and eternal life, than it is to have
   your joys now and then to be driven forever from the Presence of the
   Lord.

   I am about to close the sermon and you will go your way and there will
   be some few blessed by the Holy Spirit, in whom God's Word will abide.
   But oh, for the many of you, for the many of you, we do but preach in
   vain. We do but speak to ears that are dull of hearing and to hearts
   that will not feel. If I have told you what is false, reject it--laugh
   at it! If I have tried to stir you up about a theme which does not
   concern you, turn on your heels and go your way.

   But oh, Sirs, if these things are real, if they are true, if there is
   but a step between us and death, I entreat you, by the love you bear to
   your own selves, if not by any care for God or Christ, to meditate upon
   these things. And may God lead you out of self to Christ--away from
   your sin to Him who is the great Sin-Bearer, that you may find in Him
   eternal life. "Turn you, turn you, why will you die, O house of
   Israel?" Why will you perish? Why will you go down to destruction? Why
   will you make your bed in Hell, and dwell with everlasting burnings?
   God turn you! May God turn you now, and by His Grace save you. And to
   Him shall be the glory forever and ever! Amen.

                     Resurrection--Christ The First Fruits

   RESURRECTION--CHRIST THE FIRST FRUITS

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 20, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of
   them that slept."

   1 Corinthians 15:20.

   THE fact of Christ's resurrection is exceedingly well attested. It was
   necessary that it should be beyond dispute, since it lies at the very
   basis of our holy faith. It is consoling to think that it is so. For
   thus our foundation stands most secure. Our Lord was careful to show
   Himself after His resurrection to those who, having known Him before
   His decease, would be able to answer for the identity of His Person.
   Had He merely showed Himself to strangers who had not known Him before,
   they might have been able to say that they had seen such an one, but
   they could not have affirmed that He was the same person who had been
   buried.

   But showing Himself to men like Thomas, and bidding them put their
   fingers into the print of the nails, and thrust their hand into His
   side, He gave to men the most absolute proofs of His resurrection and
   received from the most competent witnesses the most assured evidence
   that no deception had been practiced. "Handle Me and see that it is I,
   Myself," was a challenge of identity all the more conclusive because it
   was addressed to the men who had known Him intimately during the whole
   period of His ministry.

   The witnesses were men who had nothing to gain by giving their
   evidence, but everything to lose--they were unlearned men, utterly
   unfitted to found or promulgate an impostor. Their evidence was so
   clearly borne out by the absence of the Body of Christ from the tomb
   that it was found necessary to invent an impossible story in order to
   account for that absence. The eye-witnesses were just the right men,
   such as prudence would select if we had now to hand down such a
   transaction to future faith and history. Our Lord, to put the matter
   beyond controversy, took care to appear many times and to numerous
   companies.

   Our Apostle gives a summary of those appearances which had most fully
   come under his own notice. "He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
   after that, He was seen of above five hundred Brethren at once; of whom
   the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep.
   After that, He was seen of James. Then of all the Apostles. And last of
   all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time" (1 Cor.
   15:5-8). From the Evangelistic reports we are led to believe that
   Christ appeared no less than twelve times to His disciples. For some of
   these instances which the Apostle Paul mentions under one head, may
   include two or three appearances.

   As, for instance, "then of the twelve" may denote His two visits to the
   Apostles. For you remember He first appeared to them when Thomas was
   absent and afterwards when Thomas was present. Isaac Ambrose gives a
   summary of these appearances to this effect. He showed himself to Mary
   Magdalene by herself, then to all the Marys, next to Simon Peter,
   alone, afterwards to the two disciples journeying to Emmaus. To the ten
   Apostles when the doors were shut. To all the disciples when Thomas was
   with them. To Peter, John and others while fishing in the lake of
   Tiberias.

   To five hundred Brethren at once. To James, the Lord's brother. To the
   eleven disciples in Galilee. To all the Apostles and disciples at
   Olivet before His ascension. And lastly to the Apostle Paul on the road
   to Damascus. There may even have been more than these, for we have no
   proof that all His appearances are on record. Enough, however, we have,
   and more would answer no useful end.

   So clear is the evidence of Christ's resurrection, that when Gilbert
   West--a celebrated infidel--selected this subject as the point of
   attack, sitting down to weigh the evidence and to digest the whole
   matter, although filled with prejudice, he was so startled with the
   abundant witness to the truth of this fact, that he expressed himself a
   convert and has left as a heritage for coming generations a most
   valuable treatise, entitled, "Observations on the Resurrection of
   Christ." He laid down certain laws of evidence to begin with, and then
   went to the matter as though he had been a lawyer examining the pros
   and cons of any matter in dispute. And this, which is the fundamental
   doctrine of our faith, seemed to him so exceedingly clear that he
   renounced his unbelief and became a professor of Christianity!

   Does it not strike you that very many events of the greatest importance
   recorded in history and commonly believed, could not in the nature of
   things have been witnessed by one-tenth as many as the resurrection of
   Christ? The signing of famous treaties affecting nations--the births of
   princes--the remarks of cabinet ministers--the projects of
   conspirators--and the deeds of assassins--any and all of these have
   been made turning points in history, and are never questioned as facts.
   And yet few could have been present to witness them. I venture to
   assert that even the most recent political event, which has caused so
   much sorrow to our whole nation--the death of the lamented Prince
   Albert--had not nearly so many witnesses as the resurrection of Christ.

   If it came to a matter of dispute, it were far easier to prove that
   Christ is risen, than to prove that the Prince is dead. If it came to
   the counting of the witnesses who saw the Prince die and could attest
   the identity of the body now resting in the royal vault with that which
   they saw fever-stricken in the bed-chamber--it strikes me they would
   turn out to be far fewer than those who saw the Lord after He had risen
   and were persuaded that it was Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified and
   had burst the bonds of death. If this fact is to be denied, there is an
   end to all witness and we say deliberately what David said in
   haste--"All men are liars."

   And from this day forth every man must become so skeptical of his
   neighbor, that he will never believe anything which he has not himself
   seen. The next step will be to doubt the evidence of his own senses. To
   what further follies men may then rush, I will not venture to predict!
   We believe that the very best attested fact in all history is the
   resurrection of Christ. Historical doubts concerning the existence of
   Napoleon Bonaparte, or the stabbing of Julius Caesar, or the Norman
   Conquest, would be quite as reasonable as doubts concerning the
   resurrection of the Lord Jesus.

   None of these matters have such witnesses as those who testify of
   Him--witnesses who were manifestly truthful, since they suffered for
   their testimony and most of them died ignominious and painful deaths as
   the results of their belief. We have more and better evidence for this
   fact than for anything else which is written in history, either sacred
   or profane. Oh, how should we rejoice, we who hang our salvation wholly
   upon Christ, that beyond a doubt it is established that, "now is Christ
   risen from the dead."

   But you may ask the question at the outset, "Why is it that the
   resurrection of Christ is of so much importance?" Upon it we have said
   that the whole system of Christianity rests. For, "If Christ is not
   risen, then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain. You are
   yet in your sins" (1 Cor. 15:14, 17). The Divinity of Christ finds its
   surest proof in His resurrection, since the Apostle tells us in the
   first chapter of Romans, at the fourth verse, that Christ was,
   "Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of
   holiness, by the resurrection from the dead."

   It would not be unreasonable to doubt His Deity if He had not risen.
   Moreover, Christ's sovereignty also depends upon His resurrection for
   Scripture affirms--"To this end Christ both died and rose and revived,
   that He might be Lord, both of the dead and living" (Rom. 14:9). Again,
   our justification, that choice blessing of the Covenant, hangs upon
   Christ's resurrection. "He was delivered for our offenses and was
   raised again for our justification" (Rom. 4:25). No, more--our very
   regeneration depends upon His resurrection, for Peter, speaking by the
   Holy Spirit, exclaims, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, which according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again
   unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead"
   (1 Peter 1:3).

   And most certainly our ultimate resurrection rests here. For, "If the
   Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwells in you, He
   that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal
   bodies by His Spirit that dwells in you" (Rom. 8:11). If Christ is not
   risen, then shall we not rise. But if He is risen, then they who are
   asleep in Christ have not perished, but in their flesh shall surely
   behold their God. It would not be difficult to enlarge this catalog.
   The fact is that the silver thread of resurrection runs through all the
   blessings, from regeneration onward to our eternal glory, and binds
   them together.

   It is time to pass on and come more fully to the text. "But now is
   Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that
   slept." Let me draw your attention, first of all, to the pictures here
   given of the death of the saints. Further, we shall observe the
   singular relationship which exists between Christ's resurrection and
   the resurrection of the saints. And before we leave the subject, we
   shall suggest certain practical considerations arising from the
   doctrine before us.

   I. First of all, then, THE TEXT GIVES A VIEW OF DEATH VERY COMMOM IN
   SCRIPTURE, BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY ACCEPTED AMONG US.

   The representations of the text, I take it, are twofold. Death is here
   compared to a sleep--"The first fruits of them that slept." But
   moreover, you will plainly perceive it is compared also to a sowing.
   For Christ is pictured as being "the first fruits." Now, to a harvest
   there must have been a sowing. If the resurrection of Christ is the
   first fruits, then the resurrection of the elect must be looked upon as
   a harvest, and death would, therefore, be symbolized by a sowing.

   1. First, then, we have before us the picture so commonly employed in
   Scripture of death as a sleep. We must not make a mistake by imagining
   that the soul sleeps. Such a heresy was once received by a large number
   of persons--it has long ago been rejected as being inconsistent--as
   well as with natural as with revealed religion. The soul undergoes no
   purgatorial purification or preparative slumber in the limbo of the
   fathers. Beyond a doubt, "Today shall you be with Me in Paradise," is
   the whisper of Christ to every dying saint. They sleep in Jesus but
   their souls sleep not. They are before the Throne of God, praising Him
   day and night in His temple--singing hallelujahs to Him who has washed
   them from their sins in His blood. It is the body that sleeps in its
   lonely bed of earth, beneath the coverlet of grass, with the cold clay
   for its pillow.

   But what is this sleep? We all know that the surface idea connected
   with sleep is that of resting. That is doubtless just the thought which
   the Spirit of God would convey to us. The eyes of the sleeper ache no
   more with the glare of light or with the rush of tears. His ears are
   teased no more with the noise of strife or the murmur of suffering. His
   hands are no more weakened by long protracted effort and painful
   weariness. His feet are no more blistered with journeying to and fro
   along a rugged road. There is rest for aching heads, and strained
   muscles, and overtaxed nerves, and loosened joints, and panting lungs
   and heavy hearts, in the sweet repose of sleep.

   On yonder couch, however hard, the laborer shakes off his toil, the
   merchant his care, the thinker his difficulties and the sufferer his
   pains. Sleep makes each night a Sunday for the day. Sleeps shuts, too,
   the door of the soul and bids all intruders tarry for awhile, that the
   royal life within may enter into its summer garden of ease. From the
   sweat of his brow man is delivered by sleep, and the thorn and thistle
   of the curse cease to tear his flesh. So is it with the body while it
   sleeps in the tomb. The weary are at rest. The servant is as much at
   ease as his lord. The galley slave no more tugs the oar, the salve
   forgets the whip.

   No more the worker leans on his spade, no more the thinker props his
   pensive head. The wheel stands still, the shuttle is not in motion, the
   hand which turned the one and the fingers which threw the other are
   quiet. The body and all its members find the tomb a couch of sufficient
   length and breadth. The coffin shuts out all disturbance, labor, or
   effort. The toil-worn Believer quietly sleeps, as does the child weary
   with its play, when it shuts its eyes and slumbers on its mother's
   breast. Oh, happy they who die in the Lord! They rest from their labors
   and their works do follow them. We would not shun toil, for though it
   is in itself a curse, it is, when sanctified, a blessing.

   Yet toil for toil's sake we would not choose, and when God's work is
   done we are too glad to think that our work is done, too. The mighty
   Husbandman, when we have fulfilled our day, shall bid His servants rest
   upon the best of beds, for the clods of the valley shall be sweet to
   them. Their repose shall never be broken until He shall rouse them up
   to give them their full reward. Guarded by angels, curtained by eternal
   mysteries, resting on the lap of mother earth, you shall sleep on--you
   inheritors of glory--till the fullness of time shall bring you the
   fullness of redemption.

   Moreover, we look upon sleep as a season of forgetfulness and in this,
   too, it images death. "Their memory and their love are lost." They are
   "alike, unknowing and unknown." Their sons come to honor and they know
   it not. Or their seed degenerates but it causes them no grief. Let
   armies march over their tombs--their tramp shall disturb them no more
   than the crawling of a worm. Let the vault of Heaven blaze with the
   flaming bolts of God, let the earth shake at the awful voice of the
   thunder, let the cedars be broken, let the rocks be shivered, let the
   sea roar--there, under their green hillocks they slumber as peacefully
   as though it were a soft summer evening when the hum of a bee or the
   flitting of a fly were the only sounds. The dead may be remembered by
   their kinsfolk. But they remember not. They have forgotten the joys and
   the sorrows, the peace and the strife, the defeats and the victories of
   time.

   The soul forgets not. And we have no reason to believe that the
   glorified are ignorant of what is going on below. We have far more
   presumptive evidence that they "know even as they are known"--that they
   still have communion with the living Church on earth and that the
   Church victorious is not sundered from the Church militant in point of
   knowledge.

   But as to their bodies, what do their bodies know? What does the human
   organism now understand? Take up the skull-- see if there is memory
   there. Look at the place where once the heart was, and see if there is
   any trace of present emotion. Gather into your hands the bones--see if
   they are still obedient to muscles which could be moved at will as
   passing events might affect the mind. Try to discover any live coals
   amid your heap of ashes--a heart still quivering with delight, or an
   eye moistened by a sorrow. These dry bones are forgetful,
   indeed--steeped in forgetfulness, these decayed skeletons know nothing.

   But yet once more--sleep has its intent and purpose. We do not close
   our eyes without aim and open them again without benefit. The old
   cauldron of Seder has its full meaning in sleep. In the old tradition
   we read of Medea the enchantress casting the limbs of old men into her
   cauldron that they might come forth young again. Sleep does all this in
   its fashion. We are old enough oftentimes, after hours of thinking and
   of labor--but we sleep and we wake refreshed--as though we were
   beginning a new life. The sun begins a new day when he rises from the
   eastern sea. And we begin a new life of renewed vigor when we rise from
   the couch of quiet rest.

   "Tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep."

   Now, such is the effect of the body's visit to its grave. The righteous
   are put into their graves all weary and worn. But such they will not
   rise. They go there with the furrowed brow, the hollowed cheek, the
   wrinkled skin--they shall wake up in beauty and glory. The old man
   totters there, leaning on his staff. The palsied comes there, trembling
   all the way. The halt, the lame, the withered, the blind journey in
   doleful pilgrimage to the common dormitory. But they shall not rise
   decrepit, deformed, or diseased, but strong, vigorous, active,
   glorious, immortal! The shriveled seed, so destitute of form and
   comeliness, shall rise from the dust a beauteous flower.

   A green blade all fresh and young shall spring up where before there
   was the dried decayed grain. Well said the holy martyrs, when their
   limbs were being torn away--"We cheerfully resign these members to the
   God who gave them to us." Our members are not ours to hold or lose, no
   torment can rob us of them in reality. For when we wake up in Christ's
   likeness it will not be as halt or lame, but full of strength and
   vigor--more comely than earthly sons of men. The winter of the grave
   shall soon give way to the spring of resurrection and the summer of
   glory. Blessed is death, since it answers all the ends of medicine to
   this mortal frame and through the Divine power disrobes us of the
   leprous rags of flesh, to clothe us with the wedding garment of
   incorruption!

   One reflection must not escape our notice--this is not a dreamy
   slumber. The sleep of some men is much more wearying than refreshing.
   Unbidden thoughts steal away the couch from under them and throw them
   on the rack. The involuntary action of the mind prevents us at times
   from taking rest in sleep. But not so with the dear departed. In that
   sleep of death no dreams can come, nor do they feel a terror in
   undressing for that last bed, for no phantoms, visions, or terrors by
   night shall vex their peace. Their bodies rest in the most profound
   slumber. It is sleep, indeed, such as the Lord gives, for, "So He gives
   His Beloved sleep."

   Nor ought we ever to look upon it as a hopeless sleep. We have seen
   persons sleep who have been long emaciated by sickness, and we have
   said, "That eye will never open again. He will sleep himself from time
   into eternity." We have felt that the sleep was the prelude of the
   eternal slumber, and might probably melt into it. But it is not so
   here. They sleep a healthy sleep--not thrown over them by death-bearing
   drugs, nor fell disease. They sleep to wake and not to die the second
   death. They sleep to wake--to wake in joyous fellowship, when the
   Redeemer stands in the latter day upon the earth. Sleep on, then, you
   servants of the Lord, for if you sleep, you shall do well. Indeed,
   concerning these departed ones we may well speak of taking rest in
   sleep.

   Dear Friends, ought not this view of death as a sleep, prevent our
   looking upon it in so repulsive a light? I know we like not to look at
   dead bodies--we are afraid to touch them. Some foolish people do not
   like to remain in the same house with a corpse, at least alone, or at
   night. There is a certain horror connected with the ruins of our
   earthly house. Did you ever feel horror at a sleeping child? Do you
   feel any sort of dread of your sleeping mother, or your slumbering
   husband or wife? Have you felt anything dreadful to draw back the
   curtain of the little cot and to gaze upon the sweet young face when
   the eyes are closed in happy sleep? Oh, why, then, should you think it
   dreadful to look upon the sleeping Believer's brow?

   True, there are marks of decay which are not pleasant to nature. But
   are they not the footprints of the retreating enemy and signs that the
   corruptible is passing away to make room for incorruption? Do not those
   very marks which mar the form indicate that the ragged smoke-blacked
   tent of Kedar is being pulled down so that the curtains of Solomon may
   glitter in their place, and that the soul may dwell there as in a fair
   pavilion? Oh, look not upon the departed as though they were dead, but
   speak of them as Christ did of His friend--"Our friend Lazarus sleeps."
   Let the ears of your faith hear the Master say, "And I come that I may
   awake him out of his sleep." Let not the grave seem more abhorrent to
   you than your bedchamber.

   Let there be, by no means, such a view of the death of the redeemed as
   to wish them back again. Would you wish, when your friend has long been
   in excruciating pain, and at last falls into sleep, to shake him in his
   bed, to awake him, to tell him some idle tale? No. You have been
   watching for hours and you have said, "Oh, that he could have a little
   sleep! Doctor! Can you not give some sleep to this poor tortured
   frame?" And at last you have said, "Thank God, his eyelids drop. Speak
   softly. Tread lightly. He sleeps!" And you have been afraid even to let
   your foot fall upon the ground, lest you should awaken him.

   And what? After all the pain, the suffering, the temptation and the
   trial of your friends, do you wish to awake them? Rather I think you
   should say, "I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, that you ask
   not that he should be stirred up or awakened until Jesus please. Let
   him sleep on while the night lasts, and then, at the trump of the
   archangel, and the voice of God, he shall wake in the morning when the
   sun has risen upon the earth!

   2. The text affords us, however, a second figure. Death is compared to
   a sowing. The black mold has been plowed, certain dry-looking seeds are
   put into a basket and the husbandman takes his walk and with both hands
   he scatters right and left, broad-cast, his handfuls of seeds. Where
   have they gone? They have fallen into the crevices of the earth. The
   clods will soon be raked over them and they will disappear. So is it
   with us. Our bodies, here, are like those dry grains of wheat. There is
   nothing very comely in a grain of wheat, nor yet in our bodies. Indeed,
   Paul calls them "these vile bodies." Death comes--we call him a
   reaper--mark, I call him a sower--and he takes these bodies of ours and
   sows us broadcast in the ground.

   Go to the cemetery and see his fields. Mark how thickly he has sown his
   furrows! How closely he has drilled the rows! What headlands has he
   left! We say, they are there buried. I say, they are sown. They are
   dead, say we--No, say I--they are put into the earth--but they shall
   not abide there forever. In some sense these holy bodies of the just
   are dead, "For that which you sow is not quickened except it die," but
   it is not a death unto death. It is, rather, a death leading unto life.
   That molding body is no more dead than yonder decaying seed which you
   have just now disturbed in its bed of earth. It shall soon spring up
   again and you shall see a harvest.

   We do lose sight, it is true, of those who have gone from us, for there
   must be a burial, how else can the seed grow? Truly it is never a
   pleasant sound, that rattle of the clay upon the coffin lid. "Earth to
   earth, dust to dust, ashes to ashes," Nor to the farmer, for it's own
   sake, would it be a very pleasant thing to put his grain into the dull
   cold earth. Yet I know of no farmer who ever wept when he sowed his
   seed. We have not heard the husbandmen groan and sigh when they scatter
   their baskets of seed corn. Rather, we have heard them cheerily singing
   the song of mirth and have heard them anticipate the reaper's joy, when
   they have trod the furrows.

   Have you seen them robed in black, or wearing the dull weeds of
   mourning, while they tread the brown ridges of the fertile earth? We
   grant you, that in itself considered, it were no wise or gladsome thing
   to bury precious grain amid dead clods of earth. But viewed in the
   light of harvest, since there must be a burial, and after the burial a
   rottenness and a decay--both of these lose all traces of sorrow and
   become prophets of joy. The body must become worms' meat. It must
   crumble back to its former elements, for "dust you are and unto dust
   shall you return," but this is no more our sorrow, for--"In Christ
   shall all be made alive."

   Nor will we even mourn because of the stench and rottenness of death.
   The life germ in the grain of wheat must begin to feed on the food laid
   up in store for it--a kind of decay must seem to take place. But I know
   no farmer ever weeps because the seed which he has put into the ground
   has swollen and lost its former size and shape. He never mourns if he
   is told the seed he has put into the ground is undergoing the death
   that is necessary for its future growth. No, he rejoices in patient
   hope. Therefore, you Worms, should you force me to weep? And why,
   Corruption, should you make me sigh? Rather will I call you my Brothers
   and my Mother, for your kindly glooms are but part of the road to
   immortality.

   After sowing and decay, comes a springing up and the farmer soon
   perceives, in a few short weeks, the little green blade--the son of the
   buried life. So with the dead. There is soon to come, and how soon we
   do not know--the spring- ing up. We shall thus perceive that they were
   not lost but only committed to the grave, in readiness for "the
   redemp-tion"--put there that our souls might, when reunited, receive
   them in a better and nobler form.

   Dear Friends, if such is death--if it is but a sowing, let us have done
   with all faithless, hopeless, graceless sorrow. "The granary is empty,"
   says the farmer. Yes, but he does not sigh over it. For the seed is put
   into the ground, in order that the granary may be filled again. "Our
   family circle has been broken," you say. Yes, but only broken that it
   may be formed again. You have lost a dear friend--yes, but only lost
   that friend that you may find him again, and find more than you lost.
   They are not lost. They are sown. And as "light is sown for the
   righteous," so are the righteous sown for light. The stars are setting
   here to rise in other skies to set no more. We are quenched like
   torches only to be lit once more with all the brilliance of the sun.

   II. We will not tarry longer on this point but rapidly carry you to the
   second--THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST AND THAT OF
   BELIEVERS.

   The text tells us that Christ is "the first fruits of them that slept."
   Some professors take very great delight in the hope that they may be
   "alive and remain," at the coming of Christ and so may never die. I
   confess I greatly rejoice in the hope that Christ will come. But the
   prospect of never dying has no sort of charms for me, for methinks
   those who never die lose a great privilege. At least, to our
   comprehension it seems so, for Christ is "the first fruits of them that
   slept." Oh, then, it is a blessed thing to sleep, that Christ may be to
   us in the relationship of first fruits. They who never die can hardly
   know so much of fellowship with Christ in His death as those who fall
   asleep in Jesus.

   Whereas you and I, who feel the pin's prick of the dart of death, will
   be able to say in eternity, "I, too, passed through the grave. He was
   with me passing through the valley of the shadow of death. I, in my own
   proper person, knew a death and a resurrection, too, even as did my
   Lord, which you who never died can only understand by hearsay and
   report." Oh, happy they who die! They that are alive and remain shall
   not precede them in any privilege or honor.

   But what is meant by Christ being "the first fruits?" You will remember
   that there was a feast of the Jews called the feast of first fruits.
   This was when the first sheaf was brought out from the harvest as a
   token of the whole. It was, first of all, heaved upward as a
   heave-offering, and then waved to and fro as a wave-offering. It was,
   thus, dedicated to God in testimony of the gratitude of the holders of
   the soil for the harvest which the Lord had given. Now, this happened
   on the first day of the week. You will remember that the Passover was
   celebrated first. Then came a Sabbath Day. Then after that came the
   feast of first fruits.

   So Christ died on the Passover. He, as the slaughtered Lamb of God, of
   God's Passover, died exactly at the Passover season. The next day was
   the Sabbatical rest--Christ's Body, therefore, tarried in the grave.
   Then early in the morning of the first day, before it was yet light,
   while yet the sun was rising upon the earth, Christ rose--on the
   morning of the feast of the first fruits. And so He is revealed as the
   blessed wave sheaf preceding and consecrating the whole harvest.

   But the uninstructed Believer asks me to explain at greater length.
   Beloved, remember then, that Christ was the first that rose from the
   dead in order of time. You will mention to me Enoch and Elijah. We
   answer that they never died but were translated that they should not
   see death. You will remind me of the widow's son who was raised by
   Elijah and the young man restored by Elisha. Yes, but these are not
   cases in point. They were raised but they died again. All the instances
   in the Old Testament are only temporary restorations and so also those
   in the New. In no instance, save in that of Lazarus, were any of them
   buried at all, so that none of them came out of their graves.

   And even in the case of Lazarus, he lived but to die. He had a furlough
   from the tomb. But at the expiration of the due time, his body was
   yielded to the appointed keeper. Christ was the first who really rose
   no more to die. He leads the vanguard through the dark, and his brow
   first salutes the light of the plains of Heaven beyond the gloom. Men
   admire the man who is first to discover a new country. The name of
   Columbus shall ring in the ears of ages, because he first crossed the
   stormy sea to win another world. The name of the man who climbed the
   mountains and first saw the broad Pacific with exceeding great joy, is
   well remembered. Oh, then, sing it in songs, sound it with voice of
   trumpet to the ends of the earth--Christ is the first who returned from
   the jaws of death to tell of immortality and light!

   He is also first in point of cause. For as He comes back from the
   grave, He brings all His followers behind Him in one glorious train. We
   read of Hercules in the old mythology descending into Hades and
   bringing up his friend. Verily went Christ there and He gave no sop to
   Cerberus but cut off his head. Like a sun He suddenly flashed upon the
   night of death and scattered its darkness. Like Samson in Gaza, He tore
   up the gates of death and carried away the bars of the grave. Like
   David, He delivered His flock out of the jaws of the lion and took the
   monster by the beard and slew him.

   Like Abraham, He resumed triumphantly from the slaughter of the kings.
   Like Moses, He led His Israel out of the house of bondage. With ten
   thousand times ten thousand He came forth with a high hand and an
   outstretched arm. Who is this that comes up from the land of
   darkness--from the gates of the grave? Who is this that drags behind
   Him captive the grim prince of the realms of death shade? Who is this,
   so strong, so mighty, that adamantine walls give way before Him and
   gates of brass are broken in two?

   It is He! It is He! It is the same conqueror who came from Edom, with
   dyed garments from Bozrah. The victory on the Cross is succeeded by a
   victory in the tomb. He who won Heaven for earth when He died, wins
   Heaven for the dead when He descends into the grave. Sound His praises!
   Proclaim His victories! Let Heaven itself take up the strain, He has
   "led captivity captive," rifled the grave and robbed death of his
   sting. He is the death of death and Hell's destruction.

   But then, again, He is first in point of pledge. The first fruits were
   a pledge of the harvest. "From where, O husbandman, from where have you
   brought yonder sheaf?" "I gathered it," says he, "from the fields that
   are waving with plenty." "Verily," says the priest," the harvest is
   plenteous this year, and full, and many are the ears, for this sheaf
   bears good witness." From where, O power Divine, did You bring this
   glorious sheaf, this Body of our Lord, so bright and glorious? From
   where did You bring it, O Spirit of the Lord? Is there a harvest of
   many shocks of corn such as this? "Yes, verily," says the Teacher;
   "this is but One among many, the First Born among many Brethren."

   We know right well that there must be a glorious harvest of
   resurrection forms and immortal bodies, since Jesus Christ, clothed in
   immortality and light, walks among the sons of men, the pledge of all
   the rest.

   He was, again, the first fruits, not only as a pledge but as the
   representative of the whole. When the first fruit sheaf had been waved
   before God, it was considered that all the harvest had been brought
   into the sanctuary. It was all dedicated, all consecrated, from that
   very hour. So when Christ rose as a heave offering from the sepulcher
   and when He went about among the people as a wave offering, moving
   among His disciples, He consecrated the whole harvest. All the
   righteous dead were virtually risen in Him. All the chosen members of
   His body had a resurrection when their Head appeared as "risen indeed."
   And moreover, they were all dedicated and consecrated to God, by His
   dedication as the first fruits to the Most High.

   Triumph, you children of God, triumph in this. You are risen in Christ
   today! We see not the saints as yet ascended-- rather, we see their
   bones dried in the valley, and we ask, "Can these dry bones live?" But
   we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the
   suffering of death. And we know that He is risen, and sits at the right
   hand of the Father! And by faith we perceive that as our Covenant Head
   He has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly
   places even in Him--for He is the Head over all things to His Church,
   which is His Body, the fullness of Him that fills all in all. Never
   doubt, Believer, of your resurrection, since the second Adam was loosed
   from the bands of the tomb.

   III. And now, lastly, we will close by noticing THE INFLUENCE OF THE
   WHOLE DOCTRINE OF THE RESURRECTION AND CHRIST'S CONNECTION WITH IT UPON
   OUR OWN SPIRITS.

   First, let us look well to the holiness of our bodies. "Know you not
   that your bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit? If any man defile
   the temple of God, him will God destroy." We do not believe in
   consecrated Churches. We think it altogether absurd to talk of holy
   bricks and mortar. But we do know by Scriptural authority that the body
   is holy--that the body of the saint is as really holy as men pretend
   that Churches and temples may be.

   Now, Brethren, if our eyes look upon vanity, we have defiled the
   windows of God's house. If our tongues speak that which is evil, have
   we not desecrated the gates of the temple of the Lord? Let us see to it
   that our feet carry us nowhere but where our Master can go with us,
   lest the pillars of our house become our destruction, like the pillars
   of the Philistine temple of old. Let us mind that our hands be
   outstretched for nothing but that which is pure and lovely, lest like
   Belshazzar we profane the vessels of the Lord's temple.

   They who pamper the body, they who look to its adornment, they who
   regard its physical health more than its moral purity, forget the
   higher end of their being. For what is beauty after all? What is the
   comeliness which human skill can give? See that skull? "Go, take that
   to my lady's chamber and tell her, though she paint herself an inch
   thick, to that complexion must she come at last." And say to all who
   think so much of comeliness and goodliness--That deadly brown which
   worms and earth shall bring upon us--that is the natural complexion of
   man--and to that the fairest must be bronzed at last.

   But there is another way of minding your complexion--by seeing that
   your cheeks never need be reddened with shame, that your hands are
   never black with evil deeds--that your flesh is not soiled by
   lasciviousness, or contact with that which is evil. "Will you take the
   members of Christ and make them members of an harlot?" says the Apostle
   Paul, when he bids men see to it that their bodies are chaste and pure.
   Know you not that your very flesh, if you are Christians, has been
   bought with Christ's blood, and that precious is your very dust in His
   sight?

   Mind you, O mind you, that the slime of the serpent come not here, and
   that you defile not the members of your body, lest the Lord abhor you
   and cast you out from His Presence, as things He cares not for, being
   none of His. Let us look at things in this light, and so, by the Holy
   Spirit, escape from sin. What? Shall these eyes that are one day to,
   "See the king in His beauty," be delighted with vanity? Shall these
   lips that are to be tuned to melodious sonnets, "sung by flaming
   tongues above," talk that which is light and frivolous and ministers
   not unto edification? What? Shall these fingers that are to strike the
   golden harps be given up to work unrighteousness with greediness?

   No, as we are to be fellows with the angels and more glorious than
   they. And as these bodies are to be made like unto Christ's Body, let
   us keep them pure, washed with clean water by His Spirit, renewed and
   preserved, that we go not astray unto sin.

   But, secondly, another thought arises here. Are we among those for whom
   Christ thus stood as first fruits? For Christ is to rise first. And as
   the first fruits, "afterwards they that are Christ's, at His coming."
   Then when do the wicked rise? There are two resurrections. And "blessed
   and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection; on such the
   second death has no power." When the Lord shall come from Heaven, with
   the trump of the archangel, and the voice of God, then the dead in
   Christ shall suddenly start from their sleep and shall be offered to
   God as the great harvest, the great Pentecost, of which Christ's
   resurrection was the first fruits.

   What, then, shall become of the wicked? They shall continue rotting in
   their graves. The worm shall feed upon them. They shall be ashes
   beneath the feet of the saints. The righteous shall tread this earth,
   and on the scene of their conflict, enjoy a thousand years of triumph
   with Christ. In the latter day Christ's feet shall stand upon Mount
   Olivet. His people shall bow around Him, and shall reign with Him
   triumphant over the creature that was once subject to vanity. Beneath
   their feet shall be the dead bodies of their ungodly persecutors and
   deep down in their graves shall rot those infamous kings and princes
   and those careless crowds and nations who knew not Jehovah, and would
   not be obedient unto His Son.

   They said, "Let us break His bands asunder. Let us cast His cords from
   us." And now where are they? "Death has dominion over them in the
   morning, and the righteous triumph over them, while they lie
   ignominiously like those who fall in battle, a portion for foxes." But
   what then? When the splendors of the millennial age are over, then
   comes the end. The king shall ascend the Judgment Seat. He who came to
   reign with His people, shall suddenly, sitting upon His Throne, bid His
   angel proclaim the last assize. Then, unwillingly shall souls tormented
   in Hell come back from Tophet to be reunited with their equally guilty
   bodies, and He who is able to destroy both body and soul in Hell, shall
   say, "Gather them together in bundles to burn them."

   He shall pronounce their sentence, "Depart, you cursed, into
   everlasting fire in Hell, prepared for the devil and his angels." Oh,
   that you and I may be among the harvest and not the vintage. There are
   two ingatherings mentioned, you remember, in the Revelation. The
   harvest is the gathering in of the righteous. They are carefully housed
   in God's barn. The vintage is the gathering of the wicked. They are
   cast into the winepress of the wrath of Almighty God, "and they are
   trod under foot till their blood runs forth up to the horses' bridles."

   Now, how am I to know whether I belong to that portion of which Christ
   is the first fruits? Why, thus--If Christ rose for me and if I rose in
   Him, then I died in Him. Oh, Soul, do you believe that Christ died for
   you? Have you a part in His passion? Do you hope in His agonies? Do you
   rest on His Cross? If so, He that died for you rose for you, too, and
   you are a part of that holy lump of which Christ was the holy offering.
   Have you died with Christ yourself? Are you dead to the world? Do you
   hate the things that you did once love? Are you weaned from your old
   pleasures? Do you seek for something higher and better?

   Ah, then, if you have died with Him, you are risen with Him. Say, now,
   do you desire to be one with Christ? For if you are one with Him in
   heart, you shall be one with Him in all His trophies and His glories.
   Do you say, "No. I care not for Christ"? Soul! Soul! If you die in that
   mind you shall have no part in the first resurrection. But when the
   wicked rise, then shall you, "Awaken to shame and everlasting
   contempt."

   But and if you say in your heart this morning, "I believe that Jesus
   Christ rose from the dead according to the Scriptures. I put my sole
   and only trust in Him. He is to me all my salvation and all my desire,"
   go your way. You shall "stand in your lot at the end of the days." You
   shall have your portion among them that are sanctified. You shall
   rejoice together with Him and sit down at His marriage banquet forever.
   God add His own blessing, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                               The Old, Old Story

   A Sermon

   (No. 446)

   Delivered on Sunday Evening, March 30th, 1862, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "In due time Christ died for the ungodly."--Romans 5:6.

   There is a doctor of divinity here to-night who listened to me some
   years ago. He has been back to his own dwelling-place in America, and
   he has come here again. I could not help fancying, as I saw his face
   just now, that he would think I was doting on the old subject, and
   harping on the old strain; that I had not advanced a single inch upon
   any new domain of thought, but was preaching the same old gospel in the
   same old terms as ever. If he should think so he will be quite right. I
   suppose I am something like Mr. Cecil when he was a boy. His father
   once told him to wait in a gateway till he came back, and the father,
   being very busy, went about the city; and amidst his numerous cares and
   engagements, he forgot the boy. Night came on, and at last when the
   father reached home, there was great enquiry as to where Richard was.
   The father said, "Dear me, I left him early in the morning standing
   under such-and-such a gateway, and I told him to stay there until I
   came for him; I should not wonder but what he is there now." So they
   went, and there they found him. Such an example of childish simple
   faithfulness it is no disgrace to emulate. I received some years ago
   orders from my Master to stand at the foot of the cross until he came.
   He has not come yet, but I mean to stand there till he does. If I
   should disobey his orders and leave those simple truths which have been
   the means of the conversion of souls, I know not how I could expect his
   blessing. Here, then, I stand at the foot of the cross and tell out the
   old, old story, stale though it sound to itching ears, and worn
   threadbare as critics may deem it. It is of Christ I love to speak--of
   Christ who loved, and lived, and died, the substitute for sinners, the
   just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God.

   It is somewhat singular, but just as they say fish go bad at the head
   first, so modern divines generally go bad first upon the head and main
   doctrine of the substitutionary work of Christ. Nearly all our modern
   errors, I might say all of them, begin with mistakes about Christ. Men
   do not like to be always preaching the same thing., There are Athenians
   in the pulpit as well as in the pew who spend their time in nothing but
   hearing some new thing. They are not content to tell over and over
   again the simple message, "He that believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ
   hath everlasting life." So they borrow novelties from literature, and
   garnish the Word of God with the words which man's wisdom teacheth. The
   doctrine of atonement they mystify. Reconciliation by the precious
   blood of Jesus ceases to be the corner-stone of their ministry. To
   shape the gospel to the diseased wishes and tastes of men enters far
   more deeply into their purpose, than to re-mould the mind and renew the
   heart of men that they receive the gospel as it is. There is no telling
   where they will go who once go back from following the Lord with a true
   and undivided heart, from deep to deep descending, the blackness of
   darkness will receive them unless grace prevent. Only this you may take
   for a certainty.

   "They cannot be right in the rest,

   Unless they speak rightly of Him."

   If they are not sound about the purpose of the cross, they are rotten
   everywhere. "Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which
   is Jesus Christ." On this rock there is security. We may be mistaken on
   any other points with more impunity than this. They who are builded on
   the rock, though they build wood, and hay, and stubble, thereupon to
   their sore confusion, for what they build shall be burned, themselves
   shall be saved yet so as by fire. Now that grand doctrine which we take
   to be the keystone of the evangelical system, they very corner-stone of
   the gospel, that grand doctrine of the atonement of Christ we would
   tell to you again, and then, without attempting to prove it, for that
   we have done hundreds of times, we shall try to draw some lessons of
   instruction from that truth which is surely believed among us. Man
   having sinned, God's righteousness demanded that the penalty should be
   fulfilled. He had said, "The soul that sinneth shall die;" and unless
   God can be false, the sinner must die. Moreover, God's holiness
   demanded it, for the penalty was based on justice. It was just that the
   sinner should die. God had not appended a more heavy penalty than he
   should have done. Punishment is the just result of offending. God,
   then, must either cease to be holy, or the sinner must be punished.
   Truth and holiness imperiously demanded that God should lift his hand
   and smite the man who had broken his law and offended his majesty.
   Christ Jesus, the second Adam, the federal head of the chosen ones,
   interposed. He offered himself to bear the penalty which they ought to
   bear; to fulfil and honour the law which they had broken and
   dishonoured. He offered to be their day's-man, a surety, a substitute,
   standing in their room, place, and stead. Christ became the vicar of
   his people; vicariously suffering in their stead; vicariously doing in
   their stead that which they were not strong enough to do by reason of
   the weakness of the flesh through the fall. This which Christ proposed
   to do was accepted of God. In due time Christ actually died, and
   fulfilled what he promised to do. He took every sin of all his people,
   and suffered every stroke of the rod on account of those sins. He had
   compounded into one awful draught the punishment of the sins of all the
   elect. He took the cup; he put it to his lips; he sweat as it were
   great drops of blood while he tasted the first sip thereof, but he
   never desisted, but drank on, on, on, till he had exhausted the very
   dregs, and turning the vessel upside down he said, "It is finished!"
   and at one tremendous draught of love the Lord God of salvation had
   drained destruction dry. Not a dreg, not the slightest reside was left;
   he had suffered all that ought to have been suffered; had finished
   transgression, and made an end of sin. Moreover, he obeyed his Father's
   law to the utmost extent of it; he fulfilled that will of which he had
   said of old--"Lo, I come to do thy will, O God: thy law is my delight;"
   and having offered both an atonement for sin and a complete fulfilment
   of the law, he ascended up on high, took his seat on the right hand of
   the Majesty in heaven, from henceforth expecting till he enemies be
   made his footstool, and interceding for those whom be bought with blood
   that they may be with him where he is. The doctrine of the atonement is
   very simple. It just consists in the substitution of Christ in the
   place of the sinner; Christ being treated as of he were the sinner, and
   then the transgressors being treated as if he were the righteous one.
   It is a change of persons; Christ becomes sinner; he stands in the
   sinner's place and stead; he was numbered with the transgressors; the
   sinner becomes righteous; he stands in Christ's place and stead, and is
   numbered with the righteous ones. Christ has no sin of his own, but he
   takes human guilt, and is punished for human folly. We have no
   righteousness of our own, but we take the divine righteousness; we are
   rewarded for it, and stand accepted before God as though that
   righteousness had been wrought out by ourselves. "In due time Christ
   died for the ungodly," that he might take away their sins.

   It is not my present object to prove this doctrine. As I said before,
   there is no need to be always arguing what we know to be true. Rather
   let us say a few earnest words by way of commending this doctrine of
   the atonement; and afterwards I shall propound it by way of application
   to those who as yet have not received Christ.

   I. First, then, BY WAY OF COMMENDATION.

   There are some things to be said for the gospel which proclaims the
   atonement as its fundamental principle. And the first thing to be said
   of it is, that in comparison with all modern schemes how simple it is!
   Brethren, this is why our great gentlemen do not like it, it is to
   plain. If you will go and purchase certain books which teach you how
   sermons ought to be made, you will find that the English of it is
   this,--pick all the hard words you can out of all the books you read in
   the week, and then pour them out on your people on Sunday; and there is
   a certain set of people who always applaud the man they cannot
   understand. They are like the old woman who was asked when she came
   home from Church, "Did you understand the sermon?" "No;" she answered,
   "I would not have the presumption;" she thought it would be presumption
   to attempt to understand the minister. But the Word of God is
   understood with the heart, and makes no strange demands on the
   intellect.

   Now, our first commendation on the doctrine of the atonement is, that
   it commends itself to the understanding. The way-faring man, though his
   intellect be but one grade beyond an idiot, may get a hold on the truth
   of substitution without any difficulty. Oh, these modern theologians,
   they will do anything to spirit away the cross! They hang over it the
   gaudy trappings of their elocution, or they introduce it with the dark
   mysterious incantations of their logic, and then the poor troubled
   heart looks up to see the cross and sees nothing there but human
   wisdom. Now I say it again, there is not one of you here but can
   understand this truth, that Christ died in the stead of his people. If
   you perish, it will not be because the gospel was beyond your
   comprehension. If you go down to hell, it will not because you were not
   able to understand how God can be just, and yet the justifier of the
   ungodly. It is astonishing in this age how little is known of the
   simple truisms of the Bible; it seems to be always admonishing us how
   simple we ought to be in setting them forth. I have heard that when Mr.
   Kilpin was once preaching a very good and earnest sermon, he used the
   word "Deity," and a sailor sitting down below leaned forward and said,
   "Beg your pardon, sir, but who's he, pray? Do you mean God Almighty?"
   "Yes," said Mr. Kilpin,"I do mean God, and I ought not to have used a
   word which you could not understand." "I thank you sir," said the
   sailor, and looked as if he would devour the rest of the sermon in the
   interest which he felt in it even to the close. Now that one
   unvarnished face is but an index of that which prevails in every land.
   There must be simple preaching. A doctrine of atonement that is not
   simple, a doctrine which comes from Germany, which needs a man to be a
   great scholar before he can comprehend it himself, and to be a still
   greater adept before he can tell it to other--such a doctrine is
   manifestly not of God, because it is not suited to God's creatures. It
   is fascinating to one in a thousand of them, but it is not suited to
   those poor of this world who are rich in faith; not suited to those
   babes to whom God has revealed the things of the kingdom while he has
   hidden them from the wise and prudent. Oh, you may always judge of a
   doctrine in this way. If it is not a simple doctrine, it does not come
   from God; if it puzzles you, if it is one which you cannot see through
   at once because of the mysterious language in which it is couched, you
   may begin to suspect that it is man's doctrine, and not the Word of
   God.

   Nor is this doctrine of the atonement to be commended merely for its
   simplicity, but because while suiting the understand it also suits the
   conscience. How it satisfies the conscience no tongue can tell! When a
   man is awakened and his conscience stings him, when the Spirit of God
   has shown him his sin and his guilt, there is nothing but the blood of
   Christ that can ever give him peace. Peter might have stood up at the
   prow of the boat and have said to the winds and to the waves, "Peace,
   be still," but they would have gone on to roaring with unabated fury.
   The Pope of Rome, who pretends to be Peter's successor, may stand up
   with his ceremonies and say to the troubled conscience, "Peace, be
   still," but it will not cease it's terrible agitations. The unclean
   spirit that sets conscience in so much turmoil cries out, "Jesus I
   know, and his cross I know, but who are ye?" Yea, and it will not be
   case out. There is no chance whatever of our finding a pillow for a
   head which the Holy Ghost, has made to ache save in the atonement and
   the finished work of Christ. When Mr. Robert Hall first went to
   Cambridge to preach, the Cambridge folks were nearly Unitarians. So he
   preached upon the doctrine of the finished work of Christ, and some of
   them came to him in the vestry and said, "Mr Hall, this will never do."
   "Why not?" said he, "Why, your sermon was only fit for old women." "And
   why only fit for old women?" said Mr. Hall. "Because," said they, "they
   are tottering on the borders of the grave, and they want comfort, and,
   therefore, it will suit them, but it will not do for us." "Very well,"
   said Mr. Hall, "you have unconsciously paid me all the compliment that
   I can ask for; if this is good for old women on the borders of the
   grave, it must be good for you if you are in your right senses, for the
   borders of the grave is where we all stand." Here, indeed, is a choice
   feature of the atonement, it is comforting to us in the thought of
   death. When conscience is awakened to a sense of guilt, death is sure
   to cast his pale shadow on all our prospects, and encircle all our
   steps with dark omens of the grave. Conscience is accompanied generally
   in its alarms with the thoughts of the near-approaching judgment, but
   the peace which the blood gives is conscience-proof, sickness-proof,
   death-proof, devil-proof, judgment-proof, and it will be
   eternity-proof. We may well be alarmed at all the uprisings of
   occupation and all the remembrance of past defilement, but only let our
   eyes rest on they dear cross, O Jesus, and our conscience has peace
   with God, and we rest and are still. Now we ask whether any of these
   modern systems of divinity can quiet a troubled conscience? We would
   like to give them some cases that we meet with sometimes--some
   despairing ones--and say, "Now, here, cast this devil out if you can
   try your hand at it," and I think they would find, that this kind goeth
   not out save by the tears, and groans, and death of Jesus Christ the
   atoning sacrifice. A gospel without an atonement may do very well for
   young ladies and gentlemen who do not know that they ever did anything
   wrong. It will just suit your lackadaisical people who have not got a
   heart for anybody to see; who have always been quite moral, upright,
   and respectable; who feel insulted if you told them they deserved to be
   sent to hell; who would not for a moment allow that they could be
   depraved or fallen creatures. The gospel, I say, of these moderns will
   suit these gentlefolks very well I dare say, but let a man be really
   guilty and know it; let him be really awake to his lost state, and I
   aver that none but Jesus--none but Jesus, nothing but the precious
   blood can give him peace and rest. For these two things, then, commend
   us to the doctrine of the atonement, because it suits the understanding
   of the mostly lowly, and will quiet the conscience of the most
   troubled.

   It has, moreover, this peculiar excellency, that it softens the heart.
   There is a mysterious softening and melting power in the story of the
   sacrifice of Christ. I know a dear Christian woman who loved her little
   ones and sought their salvation. When she prayed for them, she thought
   it right to use the best means she could to arrest their attention and
   awaken their minds. I hope you all do likewise. The means, however,
   which she thought best calculated for her object was the terrors of the
   Lord. She used to read to her children chapter after chapter of
   Alleine's Alarm to the Unconverted. Oh, that book! how many dreams it
   gave her boy at night about the devouring flames and the everlasting
   burnings. But the boy's heart grew hardened, as if it were annealed
   rather than melted by the furnace of fear. The hammer welded the heart
   to sin, but did not break it. But even then, when the lad's heart was
   hard, when he heard of Jesus's love to his people, though he feared he
   was not one of them, still it used to make him weep to think Jesus
   should love anybody after such a sort. Even now that he has come to
   manhood, law and terrors make him dead and stolid, but thy blood,
   Jesus, thine agonies, in Gethsemane and on the tree, he cannot bear;
   they melt him; his soul flows through his eyes in tears; he weeps
   himself away from grateful love to thee for what thou hast done. Alas
   for those that deny the atonement! They take the very sting out of
   Christ's sufferings; and then, in taking out the sting, they take out
   the point with which sufferings of Christ pierce, and probe, and
   penetrate the heart. It is because Christ suffered for my sin, because
   he was condemned that I might to acquitted and not be damned as the
   result of my guilt: it is this that makes his sufferings such a cordial
   to my heart.

   "See on the bloody tree,

   The Illustrious sufferer hangs,

   The torments due to thee,

   He bore the dreadful pangs;

   And cancelled there, the might sum,

   Sins present, past, and sins to come."

   At this present hour there are congregation met in the theatres of
   London, and there are persons addressing them. I do not know what their
   subjects are, but I know what they ought to be. If they want to get at
   the intellects of those who live in the back-slums, if they want to get
   at the consciences of those who have been thieves and drunkards, if
   they want to melt the hearts of those who have grown stubborn and
   callous through years of lust and iniquity, I know there is nothing
   will do it but the death on Calvary, the five wounds, the bleeding
   side, the vinegar, the nails, and the spear. There is a melting power
   here which is not to be found in all the world besides.

   I will detain you yet once more on this point. We commend the doctrine
   of the atonement because, besides suiting the understand, quieting the
   conscience, and melting the heart, we know there is a power in it to
   affect the outward life. No man can believe that Christ suffered for
   his sins and yet live in sin. No man can believe that his iniquities
   were the murderers of Christ, and yet go and hug those murderers to his
   bosom. The sure and certain effect of a true faith in the atoning
   sacrifice of Christ is the purging out of the old leaven, the
   dedication of the soul to him who bought it with his blood, and the
   vowing to have revenge against those sins which nailed Jesus to the
   tree. The proof, after all, is the trial. Go into any parish in England
   where there lives a philosophical divine who has cut the atonement out
   of his preaching, and if you do not find more harlots, and thieves, and
   drunkards there than is usual, write me down mistaken; but go, on the
   other hand, into a parish where the atonement is preached, and that
   with rigid integrity and with loving earnestness, and if you do not
   find the ale-houses getting empty, and the shops shut on the Sunday,
   and the people walking in honesty and uprightness, then I have looked
   about the world in vain. I knew a village once that was perhaps one of
   the worst villages in England for many things; where many an illicit
   still was yielding it noxious liquor to a manufacturer without payment
   of the duty to the Government, and where, in connection with that, all
   manner of riot and iniquity were rife. There went a lad into that
   village, and but a lad, and one who had no scholarship, but was rough,
   and sometimes vulgar. He began to preach there, and it pleased God to
   turn that village upside down, and in a short time the little thatched
   chapel was crammed, and the biggest vagabonds of the village were
   weeping floods of tears, and those who had been the curse of the parish
   became its blessings; and where there had been robberies and villainies
   of every kind all round the neighbourhood, there were none, because the
   men who did the mischief were themselves in the house of God, rejoicing
   to hear of Jesus crucified. Mark me, I am not telling you an
   exaggerated story now, nor a thing that I do not know. Yet this one
   thing I remember to the praise of God's grace, it pleased the Lord to
   work signs and wonders in our midst. He showed the power of Jesus'
   name, and made us witnesses of the gospel which can win souls, draw
   reluctant hearts, and mould the life and conduct of men afresh. Why,
   there are some brethren here who go to the refuges and homes to talk to
   those poor fallen girls who have been reclaimed. I wonder what they
   would do if they had not the gospel tale to carry with them to the
   abodes of wretchedness and shame. If they should take a leaf out of
   some divinity essays, and should go and talk to them in high-flowing
   words, and philosophies, what good would it be to them? Well, what is
   not good to them is not good to us. We want something we can grasp,
   something we can rely upon, something we can feel; something that will
   mould our character and conversation, and make us to be like Christ.

   II. Secondly, one or two points BY WAY OF EXHORTATION.

   Christian man, you believe that your sins are forgiven, and that Christ
   has made a full atonement for them. What shall we say to you? To you
   first we say, what a joyful Christian you ought to be! How you should
   live above the common trials and troubles of the world! Since sin is
   forgiven, what matters what happens to you now? Luther said, "Smite,
   Lord, smite, for my sin is forgiven. If thou hast but forgiven me,
   smite as hard as thou wilt;" as if he felt like a child who had done
   wrong, and cared not how his father might whip him if he would but
   forgive him. So I think you can say, "Send sickness, poverty, losses,
   crosses, slander, persecution, what thou wilt, thou hast forgiven me,
   and my soul is glad, and my spirit is rejoiced." And then, Christian,
   if thou art thus saved, and Christ really did take thy sin, whilst thou
   art glad, be grateful and be loving. Cling to that cross which took thy
   sin away; serve thou him who served thee. "I beseech you therefore,
   brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
   sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
   service." Let not your zeal bubble over with some little ebullition of
   song. You may say,

   "I love my God with zeal so great, that I could give him all,"

   but sing it not in words unless thou dost mean it. Oh, do mean it! Is
   there nothing in your life that you do because you belong to Christ?
   Are you never anxious to show your love in some expressive tokens? Love
   the brethren of him who loved thee. If there be a Mephibosheth anywhere
   who is lame or halt, help him for Jonathan's sake. If there be a poor
   tired believer, try and weep with him, and bear his cross for the sake
   of him who wept for thee and carried thy sins.

   And yet, again, Christian, if this be true that there is an atonement
   made for sin, tell it, tell it, tell it. "We cannot all preach," say
   you; no, but tell it, tell it. "I would not prepare a sermon;" tell it;
   tell out the story; tell out the mystery and wonder of Christ's love.
   "But I should never get a congregation;" tell it in your house; tell it
   by the fire-side. "But I have none but little children:" tell it to
   your children, and let them know the sweet mystery on the cross, and
   the blessed history of him who lived and died for sinners. Tell it, for
   you know not into what ears you may speak. Tell it often, for thus you
   will have the better hope that you may turn sinners to Christ. Lacking
   talent, lacking the graces of oratory, be glad that you lack these, and
   glory in your infirmity that the power of Christ may rest upon you, but
   do tell it. Sometimes there are some of our young men get preaching who
   had better hold their tongues, but there are many others who have gifts
   and abilities which they might use for Christ, but who seem
   tongue-tied. I have often said that if you get a young man to join a
   rifle corps, he has got something to do, and he puts his heart in it;
   but if you get the same young man to join a church, well, his name is
   in the book, and he has been baptized, and so on, and he thinks he has
   nothing more to do with it. Why, brethren, I do not like to have member
   of the church who feel they can throw the responsibility on a few of us
   while they themselves sit still. That is not the way to win battles. If
   at Waterloo some nine out of ten of our soldiers had said, "Well, we
   need not fight; we will leave the fighting to the few, there they are;
   let them go and do it all." Why, if they had said that, they would very
   soon have all been cut in pieces. They must every one of them take
   their turns, home, and foot, and artillery; men who were light-armed,
   and men of all kinds; they must march to the fray; yes, and even the
   guards, if they are held back as a reserve to the last, yet they must
   be called for,--"Up guards, and at 'em;" and if there are any of you
   here that are old men and women and think you are like the guards, and
   ought to be spared the heavy conflict, yet up and at them, for now the
   world needs you all, and since Christ has bought you with His blood, I
   beseech you be not content till you have fought for him, and have been
   victorious through His name. Tell it; tell it' tell it; with a voice of
   thunder tell it; year, with many voices mingling together as the sound
   of many waters; tell it till the dwellers in the remotest wilderness
   shall hear the sound thereof. Tell it there shall be ne'er a cot upon
   the mountain where it is not known, ne'er a ship upon the sea where the
   story has not been told. Tell it till there is never a dark alley that
   has not been illuminated by its light, nor a loathsome den which has
   not been cleansed by its power. Tell out the story that Christ died for
   the ungodly.

   With a few words of application to unbelievers I draw to a close.
   Unbeliever, If god cannot and will not forgive the sons of penitent men
   without Christ taking their punishment, rest assured he will surely
   bring you to judgment. If, when Christ, God's Son, had imputed sin laid
   on him, God smote him, how will he smite you who are his enemy, and who
   have your own sins upon your head? God seemed at Calvary, as it were,
   to take an oath--sinner, hear it!--he seemed, as it were, to take an
   oath and say. "By the blood of my Son I swear that sin must be
   punished," and if it is not punished in Christ for you, it will be
   punished in you for yourselves. Is Christ yours, sinner? Did he die for
   you? Do you trust him? If you do, he died for you. Do not way, "No, I
   do not?" Then remember that if you live and die without faith in
   Christ, for every idle word and for every ill act that you have done,
   stroke for stroke, and blow for blow, vengeance must chastise you.

   Again, to another class of you, this word. If God has in Christ made an
   atonement and opened a way of salvation, what must be your guilt who
   try to open another way; who say, "I will be good and virtuous; I will
   attend to ceremonies; I will save myself?'" Fool that thou art, thou
   hast insulted God in his tenderest point, for thou hast, in fact,
   trampled on the blood of Christ, and said, "I need it not." Oh, if the
   sinner who repents not be damned, with what accumulated terrors shall
   he be damned, who, in addition to his impenitence, heaps affronts upon
   the person of Christ by going about to establish his own righteousness.
   Leave it; leave your rags, you will never make a garment of them; leave
   the pilfered treasure of thine; it is a counterfeit; forsake it. I
   counsel thee to buy of Christ fine raiment, that thou mayest be
   clothed, and fine gold that thou mayest be rich.

   And consider this, one and all of you, oh my hearers! If Christ hath
   made atonement for the ungodly, then let, the question go round, let it
   go round the aisles and round the gallery, and let it echo in every
   heart, and let it be repeated by every lip,--"Why not for me?" And "Why
   not for me?" Hope, sinner, hope; he died for the ungodly. If it had
   said he died for the godly, there were no hope for thee. If it had been
   written that he died to save the good, the excellent, and the perfect,
   then thou hast no chance. He died for the ungodly; thou art such an
   one; what reason has thou to conclude that he did not die for thee?
   Hark thee, man; this is what Christ said to thee, "Believe, and thou
   shall be save;" that is, trust, and thou shall be saved. Trust thy soul
   in the hands of him who carried they load upon the cross; thrust him
   now. He died for you; your faith is to us the evidence, and to you the
   proof that Christ bought you with his blood. Delay not; you need not
   even stay to go home to offer a prayer. Trust Christ with you soul now.
   You have nothing else to trust to; hang on him. You are going down; you
   are going down. The waves are gathering about you, and soon shall they
   swallow you up, and we shall hear your gurglings as you sink. See, he
   stretches out his hand. "Sinner," saith he, "I will bear thee up;
   though hell's fiery waves should dash against thee I will bear thee
   through them all, only trust me." What sayest thou, sinner? Wilt thou
   trust him? Oh, my soul, recollect the moment when first, I trusted in
   him! There is joy in heaver over one sinner that repenteth, but I
   hardly think that is greater joy than the joy of the repenting sinner
   when he first finds Christ. So simple and so easy it seemed to me when
   I came to know it. I had only to look and live, only to trust and be
   saved. Year after year had I been running about hither and thither to
   try and do what was done beforehand, to try and get ready for that
   which did not want any readiness. On, happy was that day when I
   ventured to step in by the open door of his mercy, to set at the table
   of grace ready spread, and to eat and drink, asking no question! Oh,
   soul, do the same! Take courage. Trust Christ, and if he cast thee away
   when thou has trusted him--my soul for thine as we meet at the bar of
   God, I will be pawn and pledge for thee at the last, great day if such
   thou needest; but he cannot and he will not cast out any that come to
   him by faith. May god now accept and bless us all, for Jesus' sake!
   Amen.

                             God'S Estimate Of Time

   DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 27, 1862, BY REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT
   THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But, Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with
   the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day." 2 Peter
   3:8.

   FROM this text certain persons, more desirous to find arguments for
   their theories, than a truthful exposition of the Apostle's meaning,
   have drawn the inference that a day in Scripture is typical of a
   thousand years--that is to say, that inasmuch as God was six days in
   creating the heavens and the earth and then rested on the seventh day,
   so we must expect to have a thousand years for every day. A thousand
   years in which the new heavens and the new earth will be in
   preparation, and then we shall enjoy in the seventh thousand a period
   of perfect peace and holiness.

   Now such may possibly be the case. It may so happen that when the six
   thousandth year of labor shall be over, we shall enter upon the
   millennial rest. The last millennium may be a Sunday to the preceding
   six. But even if we knew this, I am not sure that it would be of any
   great assistance to us in foretelling the day when the Church militant
   should be universally triumphant through the coming of her Lord. The
   chronology of the past is surrounded with so much obscurity that we
   question whether any man will be able to tell us when the six thousand
   years will be over, or within a hundred or two of how old the world is.

   Our curiosity would be rather tantalized than gratified, even if this
   theory could be verified. For all the chronologies we have, even that
   which the translators have put into our Bibles, are matters of
   conjecture, and their accuracy is far from indisputable. We could not,
   therefore, ascertain the times and seasons any more certainly, nor
   ought we desire to do so, for the Father keeps them in His own power
   and as for the time of the end we believe no man knows it, no, not even
   the angels of God.

   Brethren, we would not wish to discover what God has hidden, nor to
   question where He declines to answer. It is certain, however, that our
   text does not teach the doctrine of the Sabbatical seventh thousand
   years. For looking at the whole drift of the passage, you will see that
   the words were written to meet the arguments of some who said, "Where
   is the promise of His coming? For since the Fathers fell asleep, all
   things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation." "No,"
   answers the Apostle, "It is not so."

   And then he quotes the memorable case of the flood as an instance of
   Divine interposition. Knowing, moreover, that even the faithful had
   begun to chide the tardy hours, and think the promise long in
   fulfillment, he meets the adversary and consoles the friend by the
   words of our text. He as much as says, "You know not what you say when
   you speak of length of time, for you forget that in God's estimate one
   day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day." The
   Apostle, no doubt wrote this also for the encouragement of Christians
   in our day, who, because the chariot of Christ is long in coming to the
   triumph, are growing weary and are ready to cast down their arms and
   leave the conflict.

   Like a good officer rallying the dispirited, he exhorts them to
   patience--"Beloved, it is not long. It may seem a tedious age to you,
   but it is fitting that you tarry for a while. Cease your impatience,
   and while you cry, 'Why are His chariots so long in coming?' remember
   that the time is not long to Him. To Him one day is as a thousand years
   and a thousand years are as one day." What the Apostle seems to teach
   as the general principle is that our estimate of time is not the right
   one, certainly not the Divine standard. And that when we look at time
   in relation to God, we must remember that the distinctions which are
   known to us are not observed by Him.

   Before, however, I enter upon the subject itself, let me remark that
   the Apostle says he would not have us ignorant concerning this matter.
   And therefore, beyond a doubt, great importance is to be attached to
   it. Some have a willful ignorance, and of them the Apostle speaks in
   the preceding, verse--"This they willingly are ignorant of." See to it,
   Brethren, that you do not commit this sin of shutting your eyes to the
   light. Others have an idle ignorance. They will not study. They do not
   search the Scriptures. And, therefore, many things are not revealed to
   them. That the soul should be without knowledge is not good. And more
   especially, that the Christian's mind should be without knowledge of
   God must be exceedingly harmful.

   We cannot form an idea of what God is but we should be very careful
   that we do not make Him to be what He is not. Our Apostle is most
   earnest that upon this point of God's eternity we should make no
   mistakes, and should not estimate and measure the existence of the
   Infinite One by our rules and standards, because, practically, the
   worst effects may flow from an error here. Impatience may ripen into
   unbelief. This may rot into petulant complaint, and that may breed
   inaction, sloth, disobedience, rebellion, and we know not how many
   other evils.

   But now, to the text at once and we will handle it, as God shall help
   us, in three ways. First, we shall say a little as to the general
   principle of the text. Secondly, taking the words of the passage, we
   shall dwell upon God's estimate of a day. And then, in the third place,
   still keeping to the words of the sentence, we shall enlarge upon God's
   estimate of a thousand years.

   I. First of all, then, we shall take the statement before us AS A
   GENERAL PRINCIPLE, "that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years
   and a thousand years as one day."

   1. In opening up this general principle, we remark that all time is
   equally present with God. When we know that an event is to transpire
   today, it appears very near to us. But when we know that it will not
   occur until a thousand years have elapsed, we think nothing of it. We
   feel that we shall have gone to our graves long before that era, and
   therefore the event does not strike us as having any connection with
   ourselves. Now, it is not so with God. All things are equally near and
   present to His view. The distance of a thousand years, before the
   occurrence of an event, is no more to Him than would be the interval of
   a day.

   With God, indeed, there is neither past, present, nor future. He takes
   for His name the "I AM." He does not call himself the "I WAS," for then
   we should conceive that He used to be something which He is not
   now--that some part of His Character had changed, or some attribute
   ceased from existence--for there is an ominous sound of annihilation in
   the sound of the word, "He WAS." Is it not rather a knell for the dead,
   than a name for the living?

   Nor does our Lord God speak of Himself as the "I SHALL BE," for that
   might lead us to imagine that He is not now something which He is to be
   in the ages to come--whereas, we know that His Being is perfect, His
   Essence infinite, His dominion absolute, His power unlimited, and His
   glory transcendent. Development is out of the question, He is all today
   that He will be in future. Of the Lord Jesus we read that He is the
   Everlasting Father and yet He has the dew of His youth. Childhood,
   manhood and old age belong to creatures, but at the right hand of the
   Most High they have no abode.

   Growth, progress, advancement--all these are virtues in finite beings
   but to the Infinite the thought of such change would be an insult.
   Yesterday, today and tomorrow, belong to dying mortal--the Immortal
   King lives in an eternal today. He is the I AM. I AM in the present. I
   AM in the past, and I AM in the future. Just as we say of God that He
   is everywhere, so we may say of Him that He is always. He is everywhere
   in space. He is everywhere in time. God is today in the past. He is
   today already in the future. He is today in that present in which we
   are.

   This is a subject upon which we can only speak without ourselves fully
   understanding what we say, but yet, perhaps, a metaphor may tend to
   make the matter a little simpler. There is a river flowing along in
   gentle slope toward the sea. A boatman is upon it. His vessel is here,
   soon it is there, and soon it will be at the river's mouth--only that
   part of the river upon which he is sailing is present to him. But up
   yonder, on a lofty mountain, stands a traveler, as he looks from the
   summit he marks the source of the river and gazes upon its infant
   stream, where as yet it is but a narrow line of silver.

   Then he follows it with his clear eyes until it swells into a rolling
   flood and he tracks it till it is finally absorbed into the ocean. Now,
   as the climber stands upon that Alp, that whole sparkling line of water
   adorning the plain is equally present to him from its source to its
   fall. There is not one part of the stream which is nearer to him than
   another. In the long distance he sees the whole of it, from the end to
   the beginning. The boatman yonder has shifted his place since we have
   been looking upon him from the top of the mountain. He cannot see the
   whole of the river. He can only speak of the river under the heads of
   where he was, where he is, and where he is to be.

   But we who see it as a whole speak of it as a whole, and it is all
   present before our view. Such, we think, is the stream of time to God.
   From the altitude of His observance He looks down upon it and sees it
   in one gaze, taking in, not at many thoughts but at one thought, all
   the revolutions of time and all the changes of ages and seeing both the
   thousands of years that have gone and the thousands that are yet to
   come, as present at one view before His eyes.

   Or, to use another figure--there are some stars which are known as
   double stars and with the strongest telescope it seems impossible to
   discover any distance between them. They are all but joined--there are
   certain motions by which the astronomer perceives they are two stars,
   and not one--but to the common observer they seem as one. Even with the
   strongest telescope, we say, no distance is apparent between them. And
   yet it is perfectly certain that there may be millions and millions of
   miles of space between those two stars. But from the distance at which
   we stand they resolve themselves into one. So it is with the events of
   time.

   Such, for instance, as the Fall and the Redemption. There is to us a
   space of some thousands of years. But God, who is far-seeing, from His
   lofty Throne, looks down upon them and they resolve themselves into
   one. He sees the Fall as taking place in the morning of time and the
   Redemption as completed before eventide has come. To Him they are one
   thought. We look at the Fall and weep over it and then afterwards we
   view the restoration in Christ and rejoice. But God regards the whole
   as one--the Fall and the rising again of Israel are one. He links them
   so closely together that He clearly beholds the glory which by the
   whole occurrence is brought to Him and the common good which is given
   to the creatures that His hands have made.

   I know that by figures, however simple we may make them, we cannot set
   forth God to human eyes, for the face of none of His attributes can be
   seen. Yet it seems to me that we may by these thoughts be led to
   remember that a thousand years in the future are to God but as one day
   and so, too, with the past, since He looks upon all things in one
   eternal NOW, as they stand perpetually present before His eyes.

   Let the sinner remember this. His sins, he says, were committed ten or
   twenty years ago. To God they are present in unmitigated hue of scarlet
   at this moment. Let the sinner remember this when he thinks of death
   and of the penalty after death. "Ah," he says, "it is a long time to
   come." Not so, Sinner. To God it is but as a day and if you could
   estimate it aright, how near the judgment is to you, and how close are
   those consuming flames into which impenitent souls must be cast! Think
   of this, I pray you, O dying Sinner, tremble, and God help you to look
   upon your years as one day, and oh, remember, that one day in Hell will
   be more painful than a thousand years on earth. God keep you from that
   place, for His name's sake!

   2. Still, taking the text as a general principle, it teaches us in the
   next place, that all time is equally powerless with God to affect Him.
   A day does not make any particular change in us that we can notice. We
   do not meet our friend at night, after having seen him the previous
   morning and say, "My dear Sir, how much older you look!" There is no
   doubt we all do grow older in one day, but the change is not very
   perceptible, at least by such coarse, common optics as those which
   mortal men possess.

   But if you take fifty years--what a difference is perceptible in any of
   us! Some of my dear friends round about me, who are now gray or bald,
   were, fifty years ago, fine, tall, handsome young men in the full
   strength and vigor of their days. And others of us, twenty years ago
   were prattling boys, fond of play and frolic, and now we have come to
   manhood and are bearing the burden and heat of the day. The fingers of
   time blot the Epistle of life very sadly. As to this present
   congregation, wait but a hundred years and where shall we all be?
   Unless the Lord comes we shall, every one of us, be slumbering in the
   dust, awaiting the trump of the archangel.

   But as a day seems to make no change with us, so but far more
   truthfully, a thousand years make no change with God. Ages roll on but
   He abides the same as when the waves break themselves against the rock
   and the rock stands fast forever. Brethren, we need be under no
   apprehension that God will ever be affected with weakness through the
   revolutions of time. The Ancient of Days, ever omnipotent, faints not,
   neither is weary. Is the Lord's arm waxed short? Is His ear heavy that
   He cannot hear? Is His arm shortened that He cannot save?

   We shall find, if this creaking earth is to perform revolutions upon
   its axle for another thousand years longer, that the Lord will show
   Himself as strong to help His servants and as mighty to crush His foes
   as previously. And as time brings no weakness, certainly it shall bring
   no decay to God. Upon His brow there is never a furrow--no signs of
   palsy are in His hands. In the vision, His head and hair, we are told,
   are white like wool, as white as snow, as the emblem of His eternity,
   as the Ancient of Days. But "His locks are bushy and black as the
   raven," said another, as the emblem of His perpetual youth and of His
   eternal strength.

   O Sun, your fires shall one day become extinct! O Moon, you shall hide
   your light! And you, you Stars, when you are ripe, shall fall like fig
   leaves from the tree! And as for you, O Earth, your ancient mountains
   already crumble to decay and you yourself and all that dwells on you
   shall pass away as a garment that is worn out! But as for You, O God,
   You are the same and of Your years there is no end. From everlasting to
   everlasting You are God! And as no weakness and no decay can be brought
   to God by time, so no change in His purpose can ever come through
   revolving years. To that which He has set His seal He stands fast and
   what His heart decrees, that will He do. He knows no change, He is not
   a man that He should lie, neither the son of man that He should change
   His mind.

   Moreover, as there can be no change in His decree, so no unforeseen
   difficulties can intervene to prevent the accomplishment of it. Has He
   not said, and will He not do it? Has He not commanded and shall it not
   come to pass? There shall be no unforeseen and unprovided energy
   required--no unexpected impediments shall block up His path. Up till
   today He has leveled the mountains and bridged the seas. Up till now
   His own right hand and His holy arm have gotten Him the victory. Up
   till now no weapon formed against Him has prospered, and every tongue
   that has risen against Him in judgment, He has condemned. And so shall
   it be world without end.

   As long as there is a work to do, He shall do it. As long as there is
   an enemy to conquer, that enemy shall be overcome. Conquering and to
   conquer is Your course, O Lord, and throughout all ages You are the
   Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. One day, in the
   matter of change, is to God as a thousand years and a thousand years as
   one day.

   3. Yet further--no doubt the text intends to teach that all time is
   insignificant to God. Within the compass of a drop of water we are told
   that sometimes a thousand living creatures may be discovered, and to
   those little creatures, no doubt, their size is something very
   important. There is a creature inside that drop which can only be seen
   by the strongest microscope, but it is a hundred times larger than its
   neighbor, and it feels, no doubt, that the difference is amazing and
   extraordinary. But to you and to me, who cannot even see the largest
   creature with the naked eye, the gigantic animalcule is as
   imperceptible as his dwarfish friend. They both seem so utterly
   insignificant that we squander whole millions of them and are not very
   penitent if we destroy them by the thousands.

   But what would one of those little animals say if some Prophet of its
   own kind could tell it that there is a creature living that could count
   the whole world of a drop of water as nothing? That it could take up
   ten thousand thousand of those drops and scatter them without exertion
   of half its power? That this creature would not be encumbered if it
   should carry on the tip of its finger all the thousands that live in
   that great world--a drop of water? That this creature would have no
   disturbance of heart, even if the great king of one of the empires in
   that drop should gather all his armies against it and lead them to
   battle?

   Why, then the little creatures would say, "How can this be, we can
   hardly grasp the idea?" But when that philosopher could have gotten an
   idea of man, and of the utter insignificance of its own self, and of
   its own little narrow world--then it would have achieved an easy task
   compared with that which lies before us when we attempt to get an idea
   of God. The fact is, it is only because He is infinite that He can even
   observe our existence. We think of the infinite nature of God in being
   able to marshal all the stars and govern all the orbs which bespangle
   the brow of night. But I take it to be quite as great a wonder that He
   should even know that such insignificant nothings as we are in
   existence, much more that He should count every hair of our heads and
   not suffer one of them to fall to the ground without His express
   decree.

   The Infinite is as much known in the minute as in the magnanimous, and
   God may be as really discovered by us in the drop of water as in the
   rolling orb. But this is wonderful of God, that He even observes us.
   What do you think now, Brethren? Do you not think that the thousand
   years which we make so much fuss about are only comparable to a drop,
   and that the one day that we think so little of is a particle of that
   drop and that both the drop and the particle are alike to God and are
   utterly insignificant to Him?

   They are not to be mentioned. They are but ciphers in His great
   existence. They are but drops in the ocean of His life, they are but
   one leaf in an eternal forest of existence, they are but one grain of
   sand on the mighty shore of the perpetual being of the Eternal One. A
   thousand years are as a day and a day as thousand years.

   4. I think we ought also to learn from the text that all time is
   equally obedient to God. You and I are the servants of time but God is
   its sovereign Master. I cannot make an hour longer than it is--I often
   wish I could. When there is but an hour's space between some important
   labor, and more preparation is needed, one would pull an hour at both
   ends if one could. But it is rigidly an hour and refuses to be
   lengthened. There are times when we would make a day, if we could, much
   shorter. When we are racked with pain, we say in the morning, "Would
   God it were evening!"

   We want to bring the two ends of the day together but unhappily they
   refuse to move from their fixed position. Time, inexorable Time, goes
   on, with so many ticks of the clock and though every motion of the
   pendulum may be as the cutting of a sword into our vitals, yet Time
   will not relent, but on he goes. To the miserable he will never be
   fast, and to the happy he will never be slow. He himself, and his
   footsteps, retain incessantly one ordained motion.

   Not so, however, with God. Time is not His master. If He shall say to
   the sun, "Stand still and you, moon, in the valley of Ajalon," they
   must stand there eternally, unless He bids them move again. And if, on
   the other hand, He should bid them speed their course till the dial
   should go forward many degrees, it must be so. The horses of the sun
   must hasten their speed, they must fly onward as God Himself shall
   ordain, for He is their charioteer and the reins are in His hands. To
   Him, if the days were longer, or if they were shorter, it would be
   nothing. He cares not for these.

   Oh, Brethren, we understand Him not. But let us adore Him. We cannot
   comprehend Him, but let us admire Him. I say again, this is wonderful
   that He is Time's Master and bids him move slowly or rapidly and Time
   is obedient to the behests of the Eternal God. One day is with the Lord
   as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.

   II. Only a few words upon the second head--GOD'S ESTIMATE OF A DAY. He
   can make a day as useful, and to Him it shall be as long as a thousand
   years.

   Brethren, I think this is one of the most brilliant of the Church's
   hopes. We have been saying, "How many converts have been made by the
   Missionary Society during fifty or sixty years?" And we have said,
   "Well, at this rate, how long will it be before the world is
   converted?" Ah, "At this rate." But how do you know God's rate? God can
   do as much in a day as has been done in a thousand years that are past,
   if so He wills it. To the snail a furlong is a very long distance, but
   to a stag or a hound, how little it is. And then to a steam engine it
   is nothing. And then to a ray of light it becomes nothing at all. And
   then there may be something that travels as much more swiftly than
   light as light does more swiftly than the snail and then where would
   distance be? It is annihilated. It is gone.

   So is work and labor and toil with God. It is for you and I continually
   to work, work, work. And if our pace is but that of the snail, we must
   still persevere, hoping to reach the end. But the day may come when God
   shall make one minister more mighty than a thousand. When one sermon
   shall be enough to convert a congregation. When that one congregation
   shall in an instant be endowed with fiery tongues and all the Brethren
   shall go forth and themselves become preachers. And before one day, one
   natural day is set, it may be possible for God to have made the light
   of the Gospel flash from one end of the earth to the other, as quickly
   as the light of the sun travels from east to west.

   Limit not the Holy One of Israel--

   "When He makes bare His arm, What shall His work withstand? When He His
   people's cause defends, Who, who shall stay His hand?"

   When He comes forth out of His chamber like the sun, what thick
   darkness shall shade His light? He looses the bands of Orion and guides
   Arcturus with his sons--shall He not, when He chooses, loose the bands
   of His Church, and guide forth those stars of His right hand--the
   chosen preachers of the Gospel of Christ? Only let Him will it, and
   there shall be one day written in the records of the Church that shall
   be equal in achievements, in conquests, and in triumphs, to any
   thousand years of her history recorded previously.

   This should lead us to remember that when God speaks of judging the
   world at the Day of Judgment, He will find no difficulty in doing it.
   Two hundred judges might find it difficult to try in one day all the
   cases that might be brought before them in a single nation. But God,
   when He holds the great assize, shall be able to convict every guilty
   one and to absolve every penitent and that, too, in one day. The
   Judgment could not be performed better if it lasted through an age. It
   shall be none the worse because it is confined to a day.

   Oh Master, let us see Your great works! Come forth and once again make
   days illustrious things. When You brought up Your people out of Egypt,
   when You did lead them through the Red sea, You needed not a thousand
   years to break the chivalry of Egypt and to raise a wail from the sons
   of Mizraim. 'Twas but an uplifted rod--a few hours of divided sea, a
   terrific union of the parted floods and lo, Egypt's horses and chariots
   passed away and they sank like lead in the mighty waters.

   You needed not a thousand years to break the power of Jabin, king of
   Hazor--You did but speak and the mighty river, the river Kishon, swept
   them away. The stars fought from Heaven, the stars fought against
   Sisera. The might of the heathen was broken and Israel was free. You
   did not need a thousand years to drive back Sennacherib. Lo, You did
   put Your bit into his mouth and Your hook into his nose and in one
   night the angel of the Lord smote the horse and the rider and they lay
   dead and you led him back into confusion into the house of his god and
   he fell by the hands of the offspring of his heart.

   Glory be unto You, Jehovah! When You rise up in the greatness of Your
   might You shall slay kings and overthrow mighty kings. The two-leaved
   gates of brass shall open and the bars of iron shall be cut in pieces.
   You shall in one day cause the nations of the earth to say, "The Lord,
   He is God, the Lord, He is God, the Lord, He is God alone."

   III. But we now turn to notice GOD'S ESTIMATE OF A THOUSAND YEARS. A
   day is to Him as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. The
   complaint which is brought by mournful unbelieving Zion is, "He is long
   in coming! His widowed spouse waits for Him but the Bridegroom
   tarries." Oh, the long and dreary winter, oh, the dark and dreary
   winter, when will summer come? When shall the rain be over and passed
   and the voice of the turtle be heard in our land? We have tarried 1860
   years and more and yet no coming of the Son of Man. The dweller in the
   isle brings no tribute, the inhabitant of the wilderness bows not to
   lick the dust.

   Christ reigns not yet in Jerusalem, nor do His ancients behold His face
   wearing the crown of His Father David. "How long, how long?" the saints
   under the altar cry, "How long?" And the saints at the altar here today
   take up the same wailing notes, "How long? How long? How long?" But He
   answers, "I am not long. What if I have waited and the time is long to
   you? Yet it is not long to Me." God bids you think for a moment, that
   if you really measure aright, it is no lengthened period of time that
   He has made the vision to tarry. For see you first, my Brethren, the
   time that has elapsed since Christ's crucifixion is not long compared
   with eternity.

   Try, if you can, to measure eternity. You will find your task
   impossible. Even should another thousand years roll on, what would some
   three thousand years be compared with eternity? You might form a
   comparison between a shell full of water from the sea in the child's
   hand, and the whole of the sea, itself, but it were not possible by
   human figures to put down the comparison between two or three thousand
   years and eternity. No, the comparison cannot be made. It is nothing
   contrasted with all things. It is the unit put in comparison with the
   infinite. Why, therefore, do you think Him long?

   If in all eternity you are to meditate upon the riches of God in Christ
   revealed to you in these 6000 years, if through all the eternal cycles
   this is to be the subject of your meditation, do you wonder that it
   should have been so long? Marvel you not rather that it should be so
   short a time? Then, again, when you say that God is long in the
   accomplishment of His great purposes, remember that He has no need to
   be in a hurry.

   Whatever you and I find to do, we must do it with all our might--for
   there is neither work nor device in the grave where we are hastening.
   But God lives and lives forever. Our sun goes down. If the laborer
   would get his day's work done, he must toil with the sweat upon his
   brow. But God's sun never goes down. He may, like a God, take His own
   time and go about His work leisurely. Surely He need not run to reach
   His purpose. When two little kings grow offended with one another,
   straightway they hasten into war. But when some mighty monarchy becomes
   provoked, it can take its time and wait and marshal all its troops for
   the affray.

   You might have seen yesterday the clouds gathering hastily, with the
   winds pursuing them in fierceness. Their black host speedily covered
   the face of the sky, the rain fell in rattling drops and poured upon
   the earth in torrents. There was haste and fury, but we knew from the
   very haste with which the clouds came together, that they only
   betokened a hurried storm. It is when the clouds come slowly up to the
   great rendezvous--when at last God's trumpet sounds to summon His black
   warriors to the battle--when you behold, at length, the sharp flash,
   the glitter of His spear, who is the Lord of tempests and His mighty
   ones come up to be marshaled in their line--then the trumpet sounds
   again exceedingly loud and long and for many an hour the earth shall be
   deluged with the rain and men shall shake when they hear the voice of
   God breaking the cedar and rending the mountaintops.

   That which gathers long lasts long. The little is always in a hurry but
   the great can wait. "He that believes shall not make haste," simply
   because believing makes him great. And God, on whom Believers rest,
   makes no haste because of His greatness. He may well take His time, and
   go leisurely about His work. There is no need, we say, that the Lord
   our God, who is rich in years, should spend His time as we must do who
   have but slender store.

   Besides, there is an advantage in His being slow--it tests our faith.
   We are getting weary, some of us, because we have little faith. But if
   the Church of Christ shall keep on from this day till another thousand
   years, sending out the pick of her ministry to the most desolate
   regions to preach. If she shall continue to send her young, brave sons,
   fresh to the altar of distant martyrdom. If our Churches at home shall
   continue to pay a spiritual taxation like that which Israel paid when
   Solomon's temple was in the building. If everyone of us shall be
   willing to spend and to be spent for God. And if the Church shall keep
   at that stretch for two thousand years to come, (we pray God she may
   not have the trial), but if she should, then there will be honor unto
   her God, who by His Grace sustained her and there will be honor to her
   faith, which thus honored God.

   To win a fight when it lasts but for an hour, what is there in it? One
   gallant charge and the enemy has fled. Comrade, that is a battle worthy
   to be written with your Waterloos and your Marathons, when hour after
   hour, and day after day, valor disdains to succumb and patience endures
   the fight while foot to foot the soldiers stand. To see gallant courage
   fiercely longing for the charge but obediently awaiting the signal.
   Look, Brethren, how they stand like lions at bay, stand bearing wounds
   and agony and the horrors of death, until at last, the captain gives
   the triumphant signal and they dash upon their foes! The ranks of the
   enemy are broken and the foemen fall at their feet.

   So is it today. We are standing in our Churches, like British soldiers
   in their solid square. We roll our deadly musketry against our enemy
   but the foe is in the distance and we cannot reach him as we would.
   Great Master, You shall come, and then at one triumphant charge, we
   shall give but one great cheer--"The Lord God omnipotent reigns," and
   they shall fly like chaff before the whirlwind and like the mist before
   the storm.

   Further, it is well that God should thus be long, because He is
   unraveling revelation. I fear I have seldom been in the position of
   those hearers, who would wish the preacher to be longer--but there have
   been books of which one could say when we have reached the last page,
   "Would that there were another volume, that our interest might
   continue!" Now, what is the history of the Church but the great book of
   God's revelation of Himself to man? The Lion of the tribe of Judah has
   prevailed to loose the seals and to open the book for us, and year
   after year He reads another page and yet another in the Church's
   history. Brethren, if Christ should come today, if we should have no
   more conflicts, no more difficulties, no more trials, then we might
   suppose that the book had come to its brilliant golden end.

   But if it keeps on a thousand years to come, so much the better--the
   glowing eyes of angels wish not for the end of the story and the bright
   eyes of immortal spirits before the Throne, when it shall be all over,
   shall not regret that it was too long. No, let it go on, great Master.
   Let a thousand years run on. Our loving hearts will patiently bear it,
   as though it were but one day.

   And more--the victory of Christ at the end will be all the greater and
   the redemption all the more glorious, because of this long time of
   strife and confusion. I have often admired, in reading history, how in
   the grand duel between good and evil, God has seemed to give all the
   advantage to His foe. Did you notice this in the combat of old between
   Patience and Suffering? God is in Job. Job is on a dunghill--the
   messengers come in such an order as most naturally to break his
   spirit--at last he is touched in his bone and in his flesh with sore
   pains, and yet, in spite of that, Job on the dunghill, is master over
   the Prince of Hell, with Providence at his back.

   God gave the foeman the advantage and yet won the victory. So, in the
   greater battle which is waging now. When first the Gospel was
   preached--learning, eloquence and power--all these might aid the cause.
   But Christ disdained to take them. "No," said He, "My enemy shall have
   the learning. The philosophers of Greece shall have the wisdom of men.
   Their orators shall wield all eloquence but not My Apostles. As for
   power, I have not chosen the great ones of this world." So that the
   eloquence, learning, pomp and power of nations were put into the
   opposite scale and then Christianity came out, like a naked wrestler,
   all unarmed against one that was clothed from head to foot in mail of
   proof.

   The Gospel comes out like a David with nothing but a sling and a stone
   against one, the staff of whose spear, is like a weaver's beam. See the
   hosts of Philistia come up armed to the eyes, every one of them, and
   there are thousands of them--there is God's hero--he is but one man. He
   has no weapon but the decayed bone of an ass's jaw. But he dashes at
   them right and left, hip and thigh, with a great slaughter, and smites
   them till heaps upon heaps with the jaw bone of an ass has he slain a
   thousand men.

   Brethren, whenever you see anything in the world which would lead you
   to believe that the enemy is getting the upper hand, say, "Ah, it is
   only God throwing in the advantage on the side of His enemies." The
   battle was fair enough be- fore, but He is giving them all on their
   side, letting them have every weapon, bidding them take all the power
   and all the wit and all the eloquence and learning. We will beat them
   yet! Now in the name of Him that lives and was dead once more we, who
   are God's servants, full of weakness, throw down the gauntlet against
   the world that seems to be omnipotent! Against your learning and your
   eloquence and your multitudes and your authorities and your dignities,
   your powers and your State alliances, we still throw down the gauntlet.

   Take it up, O earth, if you dare! But remember when we make the
   challenge, we expect stern fighting. We know from God's authority,
   which cannot lie, that a glorious victory awaits us. Now see, Brethren,
   this is why God is a thousand years about it! He can shake the old
   harlot of the seven hills tomorrow if He wills. He can knock down the
   idol gods today if so it pleases Him. Tonight, before you and I go to
   sleep, every idol might be cast to the moles and to the bats if Jehovah
   willed it--but He does not.

   "No," says He, "they shall have their time. They shall have their
   opportunity. They shall strive against Me. I will hold in My power. I
   will not go forth against them. I will let them lay their plans with
   deliberation and execute their schemes at their leisure--but I will
   laugh at them in their preparations, and I will at last crush them in
   My hot displeasure." And then the shout shall be the louder and the
   choral song shall be the more mighty and the everlasting hallelujah
   shall have a deeper bass and yet it shall have a shriller note of glory
   when at the last the triumph shall be won.

   After all the four hundred years of Israel's bondage, Egypt's power was
   broken and Israel went free. And Miriam took her timbrel and danced
   before the Lord--so we shall also, in a few days, when all the
   adversaries are overthrown, take up for ourselves the same song of
   Moses and the Lamb--"Sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed
   gloriously. The horse and his rider has He cast into the sea. So let
   all Your enemies perish, O Lord, and let them that hate You become as
   the fat of rams."

   I shall now leave my subject to the consideration of the faithful to
   cheer their hearts. If you think the work has been long and tedious,
   you will not think so any more, Brothers and Sisters, if you obey
   Peter's exhortation, "Be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
   is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day."
   As to those present who know not Christ, may the one day of their
   conversion take place today. And that one day of God's Grace and favor
   in their hearts they shall find to be as good as a thousand years spent
   in the pleasures of sin.

   "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, he that believes not
   shall be damned." God help us to believe, for Christ's sake! Amen.

                        Another And A Nobler Exhibition

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 4, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly
   places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God."
   Ephesians 3:10.

   ALL the world has been talking during the last three days of the
   splendid pageant which adorned the opening of the International
   Exhibition. Crowds have congregated in the palace of universal art.
   Representatives of all the nations of the earth have journeyed for many
   a league to view its wonders. Eminent personages of all empires have
   appeared in the gorgeous spectacle, and such a scene has glittered
   before the eyes of all men, as has never before in all respects been
   equaled and may not for many a year find a successor to rival it.

   Why all these gatherings? Why muster you, all you nations? Why do you
   come here, you gazing sons of men? Surely your answer must be, that you
   have come together that you may see the manifold wisdom of MAN. As they
   walk along the aisles of the great Exhibition, what do they see but the
   skill of man? First in this department, and then in the other. At one
   moment in the magnificent, at the next in the minute. At one instant in
   a work of elegance in ornament, in the next in a work of skill and
   usefulness--"manifold wisdom"--the works and productions of many minds.
   The different hues and colors of thought, embodied in the various
   machines and statues and so forth, which human skill has been able to
   produce.

   We grant you that God has been most rightly recognized there, both in
   the solemn prayer of the Archbishop and in the hymn of the Laureate.
   But still the great object, after all, was to behold the manifold
   wisdom of man. And had they taken away man's skill and man's art, what
   would there have been left? Brethren, may the greatest results follow
   from this gathering! We must not expect that it, or anything else short
   of the Gospel, will ever bring about the universal reign of peace. We
   must never look to art and science to accomplish that triumph which is
   reserved for the second advent of the Lord Jesus Christ.

   Yet may it spread the feelings of benevolence--may it bind together the
   scattered children of Adam--may it fuse into a happy and blessed union
   the kindreds of men that were scattered abroad at Babel, and may it
   prepare the way and open the gates, that the Gospel may proceed to the
   uttermost ends of the earth. It is, however, very far from my mind to
   direct your attention to the marvels which crowd the area of the huge
   temple of 1862. I invite you, rather, to follow me to a nobler
   exhibition than this, where crowds are gathering--not of mortals but of
   immortal spirits.

   The temple is not of art and science but of Divine Grace and goodness,
   built with living stones, cemented with the fair colors of atoning
   blood, "built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus
   Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone." That temple, the Church of
   the living God, "the pillar and ground of the truth." Into this great
   palace crowd ten thousand times ten thousand of the host of God,
   "cherubim and seraphim," or by whatever other names those bright
   intelligences may be known among themselves--"principalities and
   powers."

   The different degrees in the hierarchy of immortal spirits, if such
   there is--they are all represented as intently gazing upon the wondrous
   fabric which God has reared. Along the aisles of that Church, along the
   ages of its dispensations, stand the various trophies of Divine Grace
   and love--the jewel cases of virtues and graces which adorn the
   Believer--the mementoes of triumphs gotten over sin and hardness of
   heart and of victories achieved over temptation and trial. And as the
   spirits walk along these corridors full of Divine workmanship, they
   stand, they gaze, they admire and wonder and speed back their way to
   Heaven and sing more loudly than before, hallelujahs to the God whose
   manifold wisdom they have beheld in the Church of God below.

   Beloved Friends, our text is a strange one. If you will reflect that
   the angels, the elder-born of creatures when compared with us, have
   been with God for many an age. And yet I do not know that it is ever
   said that by anything else they ever learned "the manifold wisdom of
   God." They were with Him when He made the earth and the
   heavens--perhaps during those long periods when the earth was forming.
   "In the beginning," when "God created the heavens and the earth," the
   angels were likely to visit this world and to behold alive, and in
   their glory, those strange shapes of mystery which now we dig up in
   fossil from the earth.

   Certainly in that day when "the earth was without form and void and
   darkness was upon the face thereof," the angels knew the hidden
   treasure. And when He said, "Let there be light and there was light,"
   when that first ray of light seemed like a living finger to touch the
   earth and waken it to beauty, then seraphic fingers swept their
   heavenly harps and "the morning stars sang together, and the sons of
   God shouted for joy." Yet I do not learn, though they were with the
   Great Worker during the six days of creation, though they saw "the
   cattle after their kind and the fowls of the air after their kind," and
   the fish of the sea and all the plants and herbs, yet I see not that in
   all this there was made known unto them "the manifold wisdom of God."

   No, more--when man, the Master's last work, walked through Eden--when,
   with his fair consort by his side, he stood up to praise his Maker,
   though he was "fearfully and wonderfully made," though in his mind and
   body there was a display of wisdom unrivalled before--yet I do not
   learn that even in man, as a creature, there was made known "the
   manifold wisdom of God." Yes, and more than this, when other worlds
   were made, when the stars were kindled like glowing flames by light of
   Deity, if there were other peoples and other kindreds and other tribes
   in those myriads of far-off lands, I do not find in the creation of all
   those hosts of worlds which adorn the wide fields of ether, that there
   was then made known to celestial spirits "the manifold wisdom of God."

   No, more, in all the dispensations of Divine Providence apart from the
   Church, in all the mystic revolutions of those wondrous wheels that are
   full of eyes, apart from the Church, there has not been made known to
   these beings to the fullest extent the wisdom of God. Ah, and Brethren,
   remember yet once more, that they with undimmed eyes look upon the
   glory of Him that sits upon the Throne, so far as it can be seen by
   created vision. They behold the Beatific Vision. They are glistening in
   the splendors of Deity and veil their faces when at His footstool they
   cry, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth."

   And yet, though standing, as it were, in the sun, though they are
   foremost of all the creatures, nearest to the eternal Throne, I do not
   read that by all this they have in the highest sense learned "the
   manifold wisdom of God." What an idea, then, does this give to us of
   the importance of the Church! Brethren, never let us despise any more
   the mean member of it, since there is more to be beheld in the Church
   than in creation in its utmost breadth. More of the wisdom of God in
   the saving of souls than in the building the arches of the sky. No,
   more of God to be seen than even Heaven with all its splendors can
   otherwise reveal.

   Oh, let us open our eyes that we lose not those Divine mysteries which
   angels desire to look into! I have now already explained the meaning of
   the text. We have, therefore, but to direct your attention to those
   points of interest upon which angelic intelligence would be sure to
   linger. And we shall pray that, while we mention these in brief and
   running catalog, our hearts may be led to meditate much upon the
   manifold, the varied wisdom of God displayed in the Church which Christ
   has bought with His blood.

   I. And first, dear Brethren, we think that the grand object of
   attention in the Church to the principalities and powers, is THE SCHEME
   AND PLAN OF SAVING THE CHURCH. It is this that they so much admire and
   wonder at. It has been exceedingly well said by others, that if a
   Parliament had been held of all the spirits in Heaven and in earth, and
   if it had been committed to this general assembly to ordain and fix
   upon a plan whereby God might be just and yet the Justifier of the
   ungodly, they must all have failed to achieve the task. Those lofty
   minds, doubtless, consider with delight the fact that in God's way of
   saving His Church, all His attributes shine out with undiminished
   luster.

   God is just. They know it in Heaven, for they saw Lucifer fall like
   lightning when God cast him out of his dwelling place on account of
   sin. God is just. And as much so upon Calvary, where his Son hangs and
   bleeds, "the Just for the unjust, to bring us to God," as He was when
   He cast down the Son of the Morning. The angels see in salvation this
   great wonder of justice and peace embracing each other--God as sternly
   just as if there were not a particle of mercy in His being, smiting His
   Son for the sin of His people with all the force of His might--God, yet
   as merciful as if He were not just--embracing His people as though they
   had never sinned and loving them with a love which could not have been
   greater had they never transgressed.

   They understand how God so hated sin that He laid vengeance on His only
   Begotten and yet, "God so loved the world that He gave His only
   begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him might not perish but have
   everlasting life." As in the crowns of Oriental princes the most
   precious jewels shone in clusters, so as in one wonderful corona all
   the infinite attributes of God shine out at once in all their combined
   glory around Your Cross, O Jesus, earth's wonder and Heaven's prodigy!
   This difficulty, so delightfully met, so completely disposed of by the
   Atonement of Christ, causes the angels to behold "the manifold wisdom
   of God."

   But, further--when the angels see that by this great plan all the ruin
   that sin brought upon mankind is removed, they again wonder at the
   wisdom of God. And when they especially notice the way in which it was
   removed, the strange and mysterious methods which God used for rolling
   away the stone from the door of the human sepulcher, they yet more bow
   down with awe. Did we lose Eden in Adam? Lo, the Lord Jesus Christ has
   given us a better than Paradise! Did we lose the dignity of manhood?
   Lo, today we regain it in Christ--"for You have put all things under
   His feet." Did we lose spotless purity? Again we have obtained it in
   Christ. For we are justified through His righteousness and washed in
   His blood.

   Did we lose communion with God? We have obtained it this day. For "we
   have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand." Did we lose
   Heaven itself? Ah, Heaven is ours again. For in Him we have obtained an
   inheritance and are "made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of
   the saints in light." And all this mischief is made to destroy itself,
   God overruling it to be its own destruction. The dragon stung with his
   own sting. Goliath killed with his own sword. Death is slain by the
   death of the Man who was crucified. Sin is put away by the great sin
   offering, who "bore our sins in His own Body on the tree."

   The grave is plagued by its own victim since Christ lay a captive
   within it. Satan casts out Satan in this case. We rise by man as by man
   we fell--"As in Adam all died, so in Christ shall all be made alive."
   The worm in whom Satan triumphed, is the worm in whom God is glorified.
   It was man whom Satan sought to make the instrument of Divine dishonor
   and it is man in whom God triumphs over all the crafts and cruelties of
   Hell. This the angels wonder at, for they see in this scheme of
   salvation, meeting as it does every mischief and meeting it on its own
   ground, "the manifold wisdom of God."

   Observe, also, that through the great scheme of salvation by the
   Atonement, God is more glorified than He would have been if there had
   been no Fall, and consequently no room for a redemption. The angels
   admire "the manifold wisdom of God" in the whole story of the human
   race, seeing that in the whole of it, from the beginning to the end,
   God is more glorified than He would have been had it all been written
   in letters of gold, without one sin or one suffering on the part of the
   human race. O Lord! When You did permit for a moment Your people to go
   astray like lost sheep, there might have been silence in Heaven, since
   Your enemy had triumphed, since the precious ones whom You had loved
   were given up into the hand of the enemy!

   When the jewels of Christ were lost for a little season amidst the miry
   clay and ruins of the Fall, there might have been a furling of
   Jehovah's banner. For perhaps it seemed to angels as though God had
   been defeated in His highest praise. But when Christ comes back "from
   Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah," wearing upon His royal head the
   crown in which every jewel is securely set that once was in the hand of
   the enemy--when the Shepherd comes back from the mountains, wearing on
   His shoulders the lost sheep which had gone astray, there is more joy
   in Heaven over the lost ones that are found again than there could have
   been over all of them had they never gone astray.

   The deep bass of the Fall shall swell the song of the restoration. The
   hollow moans, as they seemed to be, when heard alone, shall but make a
   part of the grand swell of the eternal song, as it shall peal up to the
   Throne of the Lord God of Hosts. Brethren, if you would think for
   awhile upon the whole work of God, taking in it the Fall as being
   foreseen and foreknown, until the day when all the chosen seed shall
   meet around the Throne, I think you will be struck with its glory as a
   whole. It was within the compass of the power of God to make creatures
   that would love Him, to make beings that would be attached to Him by
   very close ties.

   But--I speak with reverence--I do not see how Omnipotence itself, apart
   from the Fall and the Redemption by the sacrifice of Christ, when He
   gave Himself to die for us, could have made such creatures as the
   redeemed will be in Heaven.

   Brethren, if we had never fallen and never been redeemed, we could
   never have sung of redeeming Grace and dying love. We could not, and
   the angels could not. We could not have known the heights and depths
   and lengths and breadths of the love of Christ which passes knowledge.
   Feasted with heavenly food, we might have admired His bounty, but not
   as we now do when we eat the flesh of Christ.

   Made to drink the wine pressed from Heaven's own clusters, we might
   have blessed the Giver of the feast, but not as we now can do, when we
   drink the blood of Jesus as our sweet wine, pure and holy. We could
   have praised Him and we should have done so, but not as we now can,
   when we have "washed our robes and made them white in the blood of the
   Lamb." There is a nearer relationship now than there could have been in
   any other way, if God had not taken humanity into alliance with
   Himself, if the Word had not been made flesh and dwelt among us.

   I say there may have been other plans but certainly no mortal mind can
   conceive any other. This seems to be the most wonderful, the most
   God-like, the most Divine, that a creature shall be made perfectly
   free. That that creature shall offend, shall discover the justice of
   God through the punishment being laid upon a Substitute, but shall
   learn the love of God through that Substitute being God Himself! This
   creature was ordained to be attached to the Eternal One by ties of
   filial relationship, by bonds of affection so strong that the pains of
   the rack and the flames of the fire should not be able to separate it
   from the love of God.

   And in Heaven this creature shall feel that it owes nothing to itself,
   nothing to its own natural efforts, but all to Him who loved it, and
   who bought it with His blood. And therefore this grateful being shall
   praise God, after a sort, superior by many high degrees to the
   attainment of any other. Oh, dear Friends, I think if we study the
   subject for a few hours alone, we shall see that in nothing that God
   has done is there such a discovery of His wisdom as in the plan of
   redeeming love.

   Go round about her, O angels of the Lord! Mark well her bulwarks and
   tell the towers thereof--consider her palaces. Behold the impregnable
   strength of Covenant engagements! See the largeness and broadness of
   electing love. Behold the veracity and truthfulness of Divine promises!
   See the fullness of Divine Grace and efficacy in the pardoning blood.
   See the faithfulness and the immovability of the Divine affection, when
   once it is set on men. And when you have admired the whole, go back,
   Spirits, and more sweetly than before, unite with us in our
   song--"Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive honor and blessing
   and majesty and power and dominion forever and ever."

   II. Secondly, without a doubt the wisdom of God is made known to angels
   and principalities in THE VARIOUS

   DISPENSATIONS THROUGH WHICH THE CHURCH HAS PASSED.

   At first the Church was, indeed, a little flock, a few chosen out of
   the mass--Abram, the Syrian, ready to perish and a few godly ones in
   his household. Then the stream widened a little and there became twelve
   tribes. And soon the dispensation became more clear. Moses was raised
   up, and Aaron, whom God had chosen. Then the angels desired to look
   into the typical rites and ceremonies of that ancient dispensation.
   They were pictured standing on the Mercy Seat, with wings outstretched,
   with their faces bent downwards as if they would gladly behold the
   secret which the golden lid concealed.

   Doubtless, as they saw the sacrifice, whether it was the burnt
   offering, the peace offering, or the sin offering--as they saw the
   gorgeous ceremonies of the tabernacle, or the yet more splendid rites
   of the temple, they admired the wisdom of God, as it was set forth in
   the dim symbol and shadow. How much more must they have admired it,
   when the Sun of Righteousness arose with healing beneath His wings,
   when they saw the sacrifice superseded by the one great offering. The
   high priest set aside by the Man, who having once offered one sacrifice
   forever, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. How they
   have marveled since that time as truth after truth has been expounded
   in the experience of Believers, as doctrine after doctrine has been
   revealed to the Church of Christ by the illuminations of the Holy
   Spirit!

   Oh, Brethren, the angels, when they compare the past with the present
   and again, the present with the past--the choosing of the Jewish olive
   and the leaving out of the rest of the trees and then, the grafting-in
   of the Gentiles from the wild olive and the casting out of the natural
   branches--how much they must have admired the singular variety of God's
   dispensations, when they know, as certainly they do, that His Grace
   remains the same! In climbing or in descending a lofty mountain, one is
   struck with the sudden change of views. You looked on the right just
   now and you saw a populous city in the plain. But you turn a corner and
   looking through a break in the forest you see a broad lake.

   And in a moment or two your road winds again and you will see a narrow
   valley and another range of mountains beyond. Every time you turn,
   there is a new scene presented to you. So it would seem to the angelic
   spirits. When first they began to ascend the hill on which the Church
   stands, "Mount Zion, which is above, the mother of us all," they saw
   the wisdom of God manifested as Abraham saw it. A turn in the road, and
   they saw it as Moses beheld it. Another, and they had a view as David
   was likely to gaze upon it. And then, when they ascended to clearer
   light, and the mists that hung about the mountainside had all been
   scattered and had fallen in one gracious shower of Divine Grace, they
   saw it as the Apostles beheld it when they stood upon Mount Olivet!

   And since then, through every trial of the Church, as the eighteen
   centuries have rolled on since the Master went up to Heaven, they have
   been constantly catching fresh views and seeing fresh manifestations of
   the varied and constantly-changing wisdom of the unchanging God, as it
   is manifested in His dealings with the Church. So that both in the
   dispensations, as well as in the plan, there is made known to
   principalities and powers "the manifold wisdom of God."

   III. Thirdly, to be brief upon each point, we may conclude, without any
   doubt, that they mainly see the wisdom of God in His Church, IN THE
   CHURCH'S COVENANT HEAD AND REPRESENTATIVE.

   Oh, when first they heard that the Lord of Life and Glory was to be
   made flesh and to dwell among us, how they must have admired the plan
   of Heaven's going down to earth that earth might come up to Heaven! The
   Babe in the manger commanded all their songs. When they saw that Babe
   become a Man and heard Him preach, how they must have marveled at the
   wisdom of sending God Himself to be God's own Prophet! When they saw
   that Man living a life of perfect holiness, how they must have clapped
   their wings at the thought that man could see perfection now in God's
   own Self, shrouded in human form!

   But when it came to Atonement and they learned that God's people must
   be crucified in Christ, how struck must they have been, as the thought
   burst upon them for the first time, that the whole host of the elect
   were to sweat great drops of blood through one Man--that they were to
   be flagellated, to be scourged, bruised and spat upon, in one Man--that
   the host of the chosen were to carry the Cross of their condemnation
   upon one Man's shoulders--that that one Man was for them all--to take
   all their load of guilt and, nailed to the tree, bleed away His life
   for the whole body!

   Oh, I say, when they saw that lowly Man, with all the sins of the whole
   chosen company resting upon His shoulders and knew this solitary Man to
   be God--able to carry the whole--they must have marveled, indeed, at
   the wisdom of God. And when that triumphant Man cried, "It is
   finished!" having drained the cup of damnation to its utmost dregs,
   till there remained not one black drop for another of the elect to
   drink--when that one Man descended into the grave and the whole company
   of the faithful were buried with Him, oh, how they marveled!

   When again they beheld the second Adam bursting His cerements, rending
   the chains of death as though, like another Samson, He had broken the
   green withes of the Philistines as though they were but thread, how
   astonished they were when they thought that the elect were risen in
   that glorified Person! And when that Man was received up into Heaven
   and the cloud hid Him from mortal view, how they rejoiced to see Him
   rise! But much more to think that we, also were risen in Him and in Him
   had ascended up on high--in Him the whole Church, I say, leading their
   captivity captive!

   When that representative Personage, with acclamation beyond all
   measure, rose to the throne of the Father and took His seat at the
   right hand of the dreadful Majesty on High, how wonderful must have
   been the admiration of the spirits when they thought that He had raised
   us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ
   Jesus! Perhaps there is no doctrine that is more astounding to
   Christians than this. I know if we want a theme that will enlarge our
   minds, the subject of the union of the chosen with Christ is certainly
   the most expansive--

   "O sacred union, firm and strong,
   How great the Grace, how sweet the song,
   That worms of earth should ever be
   One with incarnate Deity!
   One when He died, one when He rose,
   One when He triumphed over His foes;
   One when in Heaven He took His seat,
   And angels sang all Hell's defeat.
   This sacred tie forbids all fears,
   For all He has and is ours;
   With Him our head we stand or fall,
   Our life, our surety and our all."

   "The manifold wisdom of God," in thus constituting Christ the Covenant
   Head and representative of the elect in all its various shapes and
   shades, must have been discovered to angelic beings.

   IV. Though that were a theme that might require a full discourse, we
   leave it at once to turn to another. In the fourth place, the manifold
   wisdom of God is made known to principalities and powers IN THE
   CONVERSION OF EVERY CHILD OF GOD.

   There are some very singular implements in this present Great
   Exhibition. Marvelous feats of human skill. But there is one thing they
   have not there that is to be found in the Church of the living God and
   that is a heart-melter, an instrument for turning stone to flesh. There
   are inventions for melting granite and for liquefying flesh but I know
   of no invention, but one, and that is not to be found in any earthly
   show, for melting the adamant of the human heart.

   Now when the Lord takes the profane man, or the infidel, or the proud,
   self-righteous Pharisee, or some tall, intimidating, careless sinner,
   and casts his heart into a fountain filled with Jesus' blood, and it
   begins to melt with penitence, the angels see the matchless wisdom of
   God. But I am sure, also, that there is not in the Exhibition another
   instrument called a heart-healer--an invention for binding up broken
   hearts and making them one again and healing all their wounds. But the
   Lord is pleased by the same instrument by which He breaks hearts to
   heal them.

   That blood which melts the flint restores us the heart of flesh. Having
   first melted the heart, He next shows His matchless skill by taking
   away despair, despondency and terror, and giving to the poor conscience
   perfect peace and rest--no--exulting joy and boundless liberty. As the
   angels see the proud man bow his knee, as they hear him in his silent
   chamber pour out his heart in sighs and groans, they say, "It is well,
   great God, it is well." And as they see him come down from that
   chamber, light of foot, and joyous of heart, because his sin is all
   forgiven, with his groans all turned into songs, the angels say, "It is
   well, great God, it is well. You wound, but You heal. You kill and You
   make alive."

   Conversion is the greatest prodigy that we know of. If there are no
   such things as miracles today, believe me, I have neither eyes nor
   ears. But you say, "What miracles?" I answer, not miracles in smitten
   rocks that yield rivers of water or seas that are divided by prophetic
   rods, but miracles in hearts and consciences, obedient to holy,
   heavenly power. I have seen in my short life more miracles, and
   stranger miracles than Moses ever worked, and wonders as great as
   Christ Jesus Himself ever performed on flesh and blood. For they are
   His miracles today that are worked through the Gospel.

   If it were appropriate just now, I might point to some in these
   galleries and on this ground floor and ask them to tell what miracles
   God did for them and how they are here in one happy circle today met
   for the praise of God. Men who once were everything that was vile. But
   they are washed, they are sanctified. The tears start in their eyes now
   when they think of the drunkard's cup and of the swearer's oath with
   which they were once so well acquainted. Ah, too, and of the dens and
   kens of filth and of lasciviousness which they once knew. And they are
   here, loving and praising their Lord. Oh, there are some in this house
   today who, if they could speak, would say they are the greatest sinners
   out of Hell and the mightiest wonders out of Heaven!

   If our Gospel is hid, it is only hid to those who willfully shut their
   eyes to it. When one sees harlots reclaimed, thieves, drunkards,
   swearers made to be saints of the living God, do not tell us that the
   Gospel has lost its power. O Sirs! Do not dream that we shall believe
   you while we can see this power, while we can feel it in our own souls,
   while every day we hear of conversions, while scarce a week rolls on
   without some score of brands being plucked from the eternal burning!
   And, I say, if the Church of God on earth admires these conversions,
   what must angels do who are more acquainted with the guilt of sin and
   know more of the loveliness of holiness and understand better the
   secret heart of man than we do?

   How must they gladly and exultingly admire in each distinct conversion
   as it presents phases different from any other, the "manifold wisdom of
   God!" That ingenious toy called the kaleidoscope at every turn presents
   some near form of beauty, so the different converts who are brought to
   Christ by the preaching of the Word are every one unlike the other.
   There is something to distinguish each case. By them, to the very
   letter, our text is proved, the manifold wisdom, the much varied wisdom
   of God is displayed.

   I have sometimes understood the word "manifold" as comparing Grace to a
   precious treasure that is wrapped up in many folds. First this, then
   the next, then the next, must be unfolded. And as you unwrap fold after
   fold, you find something precious each time. But it will be long before
   you and I shall have unwrapped the last fold and shall have found the
   wisdom of God in its pure glittering luster, lying stored within as the
   angels behold it in the Church of the living God.

   V. But time has failed me, and therefore I must leave points upon which
   I wanted to dwell. The principalities and powers to this day find great
   opportunities for studying the wisdom of God in THE TRIALS AND
   EXPERIENCE OF BELIEVERS, in the wisdom which subjects them to trial, in
   the Divine Grace which sustains them in it, in the power which brings
   them out of it, in the wisdom which overrules the trial for their good,
   in the Grace which makes the trial fit the back or strengthens the back
   for the burden.

   They see wisdom in the prosperity of Christians when their feet stand
   like hinds' feet upon their high places. They see the same in the
   despondencies of Believers when even in the lowest depths they still
   say, "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him." As every day brings
   to us our daily bread, so every day brings to Heaven its daily theme of
   wonder, and the angels receive fresh stores of knowledge from the
   ever-new experience of the people of God.

   They lean from the battlements of Heaven today to gaze on you, you
   tried Believers. They look into your furnace as did the King of Babylon
   and they see the fourth man with you like unto the Son of God. They
   track you, O you children of Israel in the wilderness. They see the
   places of your encampment and the land to which you are hastening. And
   as they mark the fiery cloudy pillar that conducts you and the Angel of
   God's house that leads the van and brings up the rear, they discover in
   every step of the way the wonderful wisdom of God.

   VI. And lastly, beyond all controversy, WHEN THE LAST OF GOD'S PEOPLE
   SHALL BE BROUGHT IN and the bright angels shall begin to wander through
   the heavenly plains and converse with all the redeemed spirits, they
   will then see "the manifold wisdom of God." Let the angel speak awhile
   for himself. "Here," he says, "I see men of all nations and kindreds
   and tongues, from Britain to Japan, from the frozen north to the
   burning zone beneath the equator. Here I see souls of all ages, babes
   here snatched from the womb and breast, and spirits that once knew
   palsied age to whom the grasshopper was a burden.

   "Here I see men from all periods, from Adam and Abel down to the men
   who were alive and remained at the coming of the Son of God from
   Heaven. Here I see them from the days of Abraham, and the times of
   David and the period of the Apostles and the seasons of Luther and of
   Wickliffe, even to the last times of the Church. Here I see them of all
   classes. There is one who was a king and at his side, as his fellow, is
   another that tugged the oar as a galley-slave. There I see a merchant
   prince who counted not his riches dear unto him and by his side a poor
   man who was rich in faith and heir of the kingdom.

   "There I see the poet who could sing on earth of Paradise lost and
   regained and by his side one who could not put two words together but
   who knew the Paradise lost and the Paradise regained within the Eden of
   his own nature, the garden of his own heart. Here I see Magdalene and
   Saul of Tarsus, repenting sinners of all shades and saints of all
   varieties, those who showed their patience on a lingering sick bed,
   those who triumphed with holy boldness amid the red flames, those who
   wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, afflicted,
   tormented, of whom the world was not worthy.

   "The monk who shook the world and he who cast salt into the stream of
   doctrine and made it wholesome and pure. The man who preached to his
   millions and brought tens of thousands of souls to Christ and the
   humble cottager who knew but this Bible true and herself the partaker
   of the life of Christ--here they all are." And as the spirits wander
   and look first at this and then at that--first one trophy of Divine
   Grace and then at another monument of mercy, they will all exclaim,
   "How manifold are Your works, O God! In wisdom have You made them all.
   Heaven is full of Your goodness which You have worked for the sons of
   men."

   And now, dear Friends, the sermon is done, when I ask you just these
   questions. The first shall be a question for the children of God and
   the other for those who know Him not. First, to the children of God. Do
   you think you and I have sufficiently considered that we are always
   looked upon by angels and that they desire to learn by us the wisdom of
   God? The reason why our sisters appear in the House of God with their
   heads covered is "because of the angels." The Apostle says that a woman
   is to have a covering upon her head, because of the angels, since the
   angels are present in the assembly and they mark every act of indecorum
   and therefore everything is to be conducted with decency and order in
   the presence of the angelic spirits.

   Think of that, then, when this afternoon we shall be talking together.
   Let us not talk in such a way that a visitor from Heaven might be
   grieved with us. And when we are in our general assemblies met
   together, let us not discuss ignoble themes but let the matters which
   we discuss be truly edifying, seasoned with salt. Especially in our
   families, might we not say more about Christ than we do? Do we not
   often spend days, perhaps weeks, without making any mention of such
   things as we could wish angels to hear?

   You are watched, Brethren, you are watched by those that love you. The
   angels love us and bear us up in their hands lest we dash our feet
   against the stones. They encamp about our habitations. Let us entertain
   these royal guests. Since they cannot eat our bread and sit at our
   table to partake of our good cheer, let us talk of subjects which will
   delight them in a manner with which they shall be gratified. And let
   their presence be to us a motive why we should so conduct ourselves
   that to angels and principalities may be made known by us the wisdom of
   God.

   And, lastly, what do some of you think angels would say of your walk
   and conversation? Well, I suppose you don't care much about them and
   yet you should. For who, but angels, will be the reapers at the last
   and who but they shall be the convoy to our spirits across the last
   dark stream? Who but they shall carry our spirit like that of Lazarus
   into the Father's bosom? Surely we should not despise them. What has
   your conduct been? Ah, Sirs, it need not that the preacher speak. Let
   Conscience have her perfect work. There are some here over whom angels,
   could their eyes have known a tear, would have wept day and night.

   You have been almost persuaded to be Christians. You have known the
   struggles of conscience, and you have said, "I would to God I were
   altogether such as the saints are!" But you are unconverted still.
   Stay, Spirit, guardian Spirit, you who has watched over this son of a
   sainted mother, wing not back your disappointed flight to Heaven! He
   relents, he relents! Now the Spirit of God is moving in him. "It shall
   be," he says, "it shall be." "I repent and believe in Jesus," but oh,
   Spirit, you will be disappointed yet, for he is about to say, "In a
   little time, go your way for a little season, when I have a more
   convenient season I will send for you."

   Angel, you will be disappointed yet, but if the soul shall say, "Now,
   even now, in this House of Prayer, I cast myself upon the finished
   Atonement of Christ. I trust in Him to save me," wing your flight
   aloft, you glorious angel! Tell the cherubs around the Throne of God
   that the prodigal has returned and an heir of Heaven has been born! Let
   Heaven keep holiday and let us go into our homes rejoicing, for he that
   was dead is alive again and he that was lost is found!

   May the Spirit of God do this, for Jesus' sake! Amen.

                            Joseph And His Brothers

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 11, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Joseph said unto his brothers, I am Joseph; does my father yet
   live? And his brothers could not answer him. For they were trembled at
   his presence. And Joseph said unto his brothers, Come near to me, I
   pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother,
   whomyou sold into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with
   yourselves, that you sold me here: for God did send me before you to
   preserve life." Genesis 45:3-5.

   JOSEPH is a very eminent type of Christ. When he was hated of his
   brothers because he protested against their sins, and when they sold
   him for twenty pieces of silver, he was doubtlessly a portrait of the
   despised and rejected of men whom His disciple betrayed. Afterwards in
   his temptations in the house of Potiphar, in the slander and consequent
   imprisonment in the round house of Pharaoh's prison, in his after
   advancement, till he became lord over all the land of Egypt, we clearly
   see our blessed Lord right well portrayed.

   Indeed, so well is the picture drawn, that there is scarcely a stroke
   even though it should seem to be a mere accidental incident of the
   picture which has not its symbolic meaning. You shall read the history
   of Joseph through twenty times and yet you shall not have exhausted the
   type. You shall begin again, and find still some fresh likeness between
   this despised son of Rachel and the Son of Mary who is also God over
   all, blessed forever. Amen.

   It is not, however, my business this morning to enter into a full
   description of Joseph as the type of Christ. I have a rather more
   practical object in hand. I shall endeavor, in the Lord's strength, to
   deal with tried and troubled consciences, and if it shall be my happy
   lot to be the means of cheering some sorrowing heart and opening some
   blind eye to see the personal beauties and the intense affection of the
   Lord Jesus, I shall be but too glad to have been God's messenger to
   your hearts.

   To tarry no longer, but to proceed at once to so good an errand,
   hopeful that God will help us to accomplish it, I shall direct your
   attention to the picture before us as being a representation of the way
   in which the Lord Jesus Christ deals with His erring Brethren, those
   whom His Father has given Him and whom He has purchased with His blood.

   It seems to me that the condition of Judah and his brothers is a very
   notable picture of the state of sinners when they are awakened by the
   Holy Spirit. Secondly, the disguise which Joseph assumed when he dealt
   so roughly with them is a master representation of the manner in which
   Jesus Christ, the loving One, seems to deal harshly with poor coming
   Sinners. And thirdly, the manifestation which Joseph afterward made to
   his brothers, is but a faint representation of the declaration of love
   which Jesus makes to repenting spirits when at last He reveals Himself
   to them in mercy.

   I. We think that the condition and posture of Judah and his brothers at
   the feet of the throne of Joseph, trembling in alarm, well describe THE
   CONDITION AND POSITION OF EVERY TRULY AWAKENED SINNER.

   By different methods Joseph had at last awakened the consciences of his
   ten brothers. The point which seemed to have been brought out most
   prominently before their consciences was this--"We are verily guilty
   concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he
   besought us and we would not hear. Therefore is this distress come upon
   us." And though, in the speech which Judah made, it was not necessary
   to accuse themselves of crime, yet in the confession, "God has found
   out the iniquity of your servants," Joseph could see evidently enough,
   that the recollection of the pit and of the sale to the Ishmaelites was
   vividly before their mind's eyes.

   Now, Beloved, when the Lord, the Holy Spirit, arouses sinners'
   consciences, this is the great sin which He brings to mind--"Of sin
   because they believed not on Me." Once the careless soul thought it had
   very little to answer for--"I have not done much amiss," he said, "a
   speedy reformation may wipe out all that has been awry and my faults
   will soon be forgotten and forgiven." But now, all of a sudden, the
   conscience perceives that the soul is guilty of despising, rejecting
   and slaughtering Christ. What a sin is this, my Brethren! And what
   pangs we endured when first this crime was laid to our charge and we
   were compelled to plead guilty to it!

   O Lord Jesus, did I accuse You to Your enemies? Did I betray You? Did I
   adjudge You to the Cross? Were my cries virtually heard in the streets,
   "Crucify Him, crucify Him"? Is it true that my sins were the nails
   which fastened You to the tree? Is it so, that I had a share in Your
   bloody murder--a tragedy by which the world became a deicide, and man
   the murderer of his own Redeemer? It is even so. If our conscience is
   in a right state, we are forced to acknowledge it. Do you not know,
   Sinner, every time you prefer the pleasures of this world to the joys
   of Heaven, you spit in the face of Christ? Every time, when to get gain
   in your business, you do an unrighteous thing, you are like Judas
   selling Him for thirty pieces of silver.

   Every time you make a false profession of religion, you give Him a
   traitor's kiss. Every sermon which you hear, which makes a temporary
   impression on your mind, which impression you afterwards blot out,
   makes you more and more Christ's despiser and rejecter. Every word you
   have spoken against Him, every hard thought you have had of Him, has
   helped to complete your complicity with the great crowd which gathered
   around the Cross of Calvary, to mock and jeer the Lord of Life and
   Glory.

   Now, if there is any sin which will make a man deeply penitent, I think
   that this sin, when it is really brought home to the conscience, will
   affect us. To slay Him who did me no hurt, the holy and the harmless
   One! To assist in hounding to the tree the man who scattered blessings
   with both His hands, and who had no thought, nor care, nor love, save
   for those who hated Him. To pierce the hands that touched the leper,
   and that broke the bread, and multiplied the fishes! To fasten to the
   accursed wood the feet which had often carried His weary body upon
   painful journeys of mercy!

   Oh, this is base, indeed. But when I think He loved me and gave Himself
   for me, that He chose me, before the stars were made, or the heavens
   fixed upon their everlasting arches, and that I, when He came to me in
   the Gospel, should have rejected and despised, and even mocked
   Him--this is intensely, infinitely cruel. Jesus, You do forgive me, but
   I can never forgive myself for such a sin as this.

   Dear Friends, has the Holy Spirit made you feel that you are guilty? If
   so, I am glad of it, for when we once feel guilty concerning the death
   of Jesus, our Brother, it is not long before He will reveal Himself to
   us in mercy, blotting out our sin forever.

   A second thought, however, which tended to make Joseph's brothers feel
   in a wretched plight was this, that they now discovered that they were
   in Joseph's hands. There stood Joseph, second to none but Pharaoh in
   all the empire of Egypt. Legions of warriors were at his beck and
   command. If he should say, "take these men, bind them hand and foot,"
   or, "cut them in pieces," none could interpose. He was to them as a
   lion and they were as his prey, which he could rend to pieces at his
   will.

   Now to the awakened sinner, this also is a part of his misery, that he
   is entirely in the hands of that very Christ whom he once despised. For
   that Christ who died has now become the Judge of the quick and dead, He
   has power over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to as many as
   His Father has given Him. The Father judges no man, He has committed
   all judgment to the Son. Do you see this, Sinner, He whom you despised
   is your Master?

   The moth beneath your finger, which you can crush, and that cannot
   escape from you, may well fear. But you are beneath the fingers of the
   crucified Son of God. Today, He whom you have despised has you
   absolutely at His will. He has but to will it and the breath is gone
   from your nostrils--and while yet in your seat you are a corpse. And
   more, at His will you are in Hell amidst its flames. Oh, what an awful
   thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God, for even our God
   is a consuming fire.

   Remember, Sinner, you are in His hands in such a way that unless you
   repent and receive Him--unless you "kiss the Son," at once, He may be
   angry, and you may "perish in the way when His wrath is kindled but a
   little." For lo, He comes riding upon the clouds of judgment. Jesus of
   Nazareth comes, robed in majesty. The books shall be opened, and He
   shall divide the nations as the shepherd divides the sheep from the
   goats. Then in vain shall you ask the pitiless rocks to give you
   shelter in their flinty hearts, or the stern mountains to conceal you
   in their hollow caverns!

   You shall seek to hide from the face of Him that sits upon the Throne,
   but neither Heaven nor earth, nor Hell, shall afford you shelter. For
   everywhere, the eyes of Him that wept shall follow you like flames of
   fire--and the hands of Him that were once nailed to the tree shall
   crush you as a cluster in the hand of the gleaner of grapes. You shall
   feel that it is an awful thing to have turned long-suffering mercy into
   righteous hatred. You shall know that to have rejected mercy is to have
   drawn down upon your head the full fury of the justice of the Avenger.

   Yet, further, there was another thought which combined to make Joseph's
   brothers feel still more wretched. Being in his hands, they felt also
   in their souls that they deserved to be there. We are verily guilty,
   they said. They offered no apologies, nor extenuations, for that one
   sin--that crying sin. They might for the matter of Benjamin--but they
   said, we are verily guilty concerning our brother. Oh, my Brothers and
   Sisters in Christ! You know what it is to have the Holy Spirit in your
   heart, making you plead guilty!

   Well do I remember when I stood at the bar of God's justice and heard
   the accusation read out against me. Nothing could I answer but guilty.
   Indeed, my guilt was so plainly before my eyes that my lips could not
   frame a denial, and had the judge put on the black cap that day and
   said, "Take him back to the place from where he came and give him his
   portion with the tormentors," I should have been lost--and the great
   God would have been most just and righteous.

   Careless sinners may talk about the hardness of God in condemning man
   to punishment, but once let the Holy Spirit show man the exceeding
   sinfulness of sin, and you will never hear a word about that. No! The
   sinner cries, "Lord, whatever You do with me, You can not chastise me
   more than I deserve. Though You should crush me beneath Your feet, or
   though you should pile up the fires of Tophet and Your breath should be
   as the stream of brimstone to kindle it, yet You could not curse too
   heavily or consume too fiercely your traitorous, rebellious, depraved
   and infamous creature. I deserve everything except Your love and Your
   pity. And if You give me these, I shall be compelled to say, forever
   and ever, that You gave Divine Grace to the most undeserving--the most
   unworthy rebel that ever profaned Your universe."

   Brethren, when conscience goes against a man, he has a stern enemy to
   contend with. When it is written, "David's heart smote him," such blows
   come home. So is it with every sinner that is truly led to see his own
   state. He will feel that he is not only guilty, and that he is in the
   hands of One from whom he cannot escape, but he will feel that it is
   right he should be so, and the only wonder he will have in his own mind
   is that he has been out of Hell so long--that the long-suffering and
   mercy of God have been so marvelously extended to him.

   Under a sense of all these things--note what the ten brothers did. They
   began to plead. Ah, nothing makes a man pray like a sense of sin. When
   we stand before God guilty, then our groans and sighs and tears make
   true and real supplication. I fear there are some of you present who
   have from infancy repeated a form of prayer who have never prayed in
   your lives. Yes, and some of you, too, who use an extemporary utterance
   and yet who never pray. I do not think men generally pray as a matter
   of duty.

   When men fall down in the streets and break their limbs they do not cry
   out as a matter of duty--they cry because they cannot help it. And it
   seems to me that such a prayer God hears--that comes out of a man
   because he cannot help praying--when the deep agony of his spirit makes
   him groan. When he cannot be kept from his secret chamber, when he
   would sooner pray behind a hedge, or in a field, or in a garret, or
   even in the streets, than not pray at all. If there were an edict
   issued that no man should pray at all, the really praying man would go
   into Daniel's lions' den, for he could no more cease to pray than cease
   to breathe.

   Can the hart in the wilderness cease from panting for the water brooks?
   Can a sick child cease from crying for its mother? So the living soul
   cries after God because he cannot help panting after Him. He must pray
   or he must die, he must find Divine Grace or perish, and therefore in
   his sore extremity--from an intense and awful agony of heart--he cries
   again and again, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" This is the prayer
   that God hears. Such are the petitions which are acceptable to the Lord
   Jehovah.

   Brethren, will you look at yourselves, and at your own experience this
   morning, and see if you ever were brought down to the spot where Judah
   and his brothers stood? For I fear we have never been brought rightly
   unless we have been brought here. He that was never condemned, I think,
   was never forgiven. He who never confessed his guilt cannot have had a
   pardon. And if we have never trembled before Jesus the Judge, we can
   never have rejoiced before Jesus the elder Brother.

   II. We turn, however, now to remark that THE SINGULARLY ROUGH BEHAVIOR
   OF JOSEPH IS A NOTABLE REPRESENTATION OF THE WAY IN WHICH CHRIST DEALS
   WITH SOULS UNDER CONVICTION OF SIN.

   Joseph always was their brother, always loved them, had a heart full of
   compassion for them, even when he called them spies. Kind words were
   often hastening to his lips, yet for their good he showed himself to be
   as a stranger and even as an enemy, so that he might bring them very
   low and prostrate before the throne.

   My dear Friends, our Lord Jesus Christ often does this with truly
   awakened souls whom He means to save. Perhaps to some of you who are
   today conscious of guilt, but not of mercy, Christ seems as a stern and
   angry Judge. You think of Him as one who can by no means spare the
   guilty. Your only idea of Him is of one who would say to you, "Get you
   behind Me, Satan, you savor not the things that are of God." When you
   read the Scriptures, your mind, perhaps is led to dwell upon His
   denunciations rather than upon His promises.

   Such dreadful chapters as the twenty-fifth of Matthew are more upon
   your mind than those blessed portions in John, such as, "Let not your
   heart be troubled, you believe in God, believe also in Me." When you do
   think of Jesus, it is not as of one who is saying, "Suffer the little
   children to come unto Me and forbid them not, for of such is the
   kingdom of Heaven." But you rather think you hear Him say, "Woe unto
   you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites." Poor Hearts, you discern all
   the sternness of His upbraiding but not the softness and gentleness of
   His compassion. You see Him dealing fiercely with Pharisees and reason
   that He will be even more severe with you.

   No, you think you have had some proofs that the Lord is not willing to
   bless you. As Joseph took Simeon before their eyes and put him in
   prison, as he laid heavy things to his brothers' charge and said to
   them, "You are spies, to see the nakedness of the land are you come, by
   the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies." And as he demanded of them
   to bring Benjamin down or else he would never see their face again, so
   you think that Jesus Christ has treated you.

   You went to Him in prayer. But instead of getting an answer He seemed
   to shut up your prayer in prison and keep it like Simeon bound before
   your eyes. Yes, instead of telling you that there was mercy, He said to
   you as with a harsh voice, "It is not meet to take the children's bread
   and cast it unto dogs." He appeared to shut His ears to your petitions,
   and to have none of your requests, and to say to you, "Except you
   renounce a right-eye sin, and a right-arm pleasure, and give up your
   Benjamin delights, you shall see My face no more," and you have come to
   think, poor Soul, that Christ is hard and stern. But He is ever the
   gentle Mediator receiving sinners and eating with them. His usual voice
   is, "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest." But to you He seems no such Person, for He has put on a
   disguise and you understand not who and what He is.

   But you will perceive, Brethren, in reading the narrative, that even
   when Joseph disguised himself, there was still much kindness
   discoverable in his conduct--so to the awakened sinner, even while
   Jesus appears to deal harshly--there is something sweet and encouraging
   amid it all. Do you not remember what Joseph did for his brothers?
   Though he was their judge, he was their host, too. He invited them to a
   great feast. He gave to Benjamin five times as much as to any of them.
   And they feasted even at the king's table.

   And so, poor Sinner under an awakened conscience, you have occasional
   feastings at the table of hope. I know while I was under distress
   myself, I did have some glimpses of hope. Oh, there were times when His
   name was very sweet! There were seasons in the thick darkness when some
   few rays of light flashed in. When, like the dog that eats the crumbs
   under the table, now and then there fell a big crust and my soul was
   feasted for awhile. So has it been with you. Christ has rebuked and
   chastened you, but still He has sent you food from His royal table.

   Yes, and there is another thing He has done for you. He has given you
   corn to live upon while under bondage. You would have despaired utterly
   if it had not been for some little comfort that He afforded you.
   Perhaps you would have put an end to your life--you might have gone
   desperately into worse sin than before--had it not been that He filled
   your sack at seasons with the corn of Egypt. But mark, He has never
   taken any of your money yet, and He never will. He has always put your
   money in the sack's mouth--you have come with your resolutions, and
   with your good deeds--but when He has given you comfort He has always
   taken care to show you that He did not confer it because of any good
   thing you had in your hands.

   When you went down and brought double money with you, yet the double
   money, too, was returned. He would have nothing from you. He has taught
   you as much as that and you begin to feel, now, that if He should bless
   you, it must be without money and without price. Yes, poor Soul, and
   there is one other point upon which your eyes may rest with pleasure.
   He has sometimes spoken to you comfortably. Did not Joseph say to
   Benjamin, "God be gracious unto you, my son"? And so, sometimes, under
   a consoling sermon, though as yet you are not saved, you have had a few
   drops of comfort.

   Oh, you have gone sometimes out of the House of Prayer as light as the
   birds of the air, and though you could not say, "He is mine and I am
   His," yet you had a sort of inkling that the match would come off one
   day. He had said--"God be gracious to you, My son." You half thought,
   though you could not speak it loud enough to let your heart distinctly
   hear it--you half thought that the day would come when your sins would
   be forgiven. When the prisoner should leap to lose his chains. When you
   should know Joseph, your brother, to have accepted and loved your soul.
   I say, then, Christ disguises Himself to poor awakened sinners just as
   Joseph did, but even amidst the sternness of His manner, for awhile
   there is such a sweet mixture of love, that no troubled one need run
   into despair.

   But, dear Friends, I am met by a question. Some one asks, "Why does
   Jesus thus deal with some coming sinners? Why does He not always meet
   them at once as He does with some, while they are yet a great way off
   and fall upon their necks and kiss them?" Perhaps we can answer this
   question by another. Why did Joseph thus hide himself and not manifest
   himself to his own flesh? The answer is here--Joseph knew there was a
   prophecy to be fulfilled. The sun and moon and eleven stars must make
   obeisance to him, and their sheaves must bow down before his sheaf. So
   there is a prophecy concerning us--"That at the name of Jesus every
   knee should bow, of things in Heaven and things in earth and things
   under the earth."

   And were it not that Christ does thus deal roughly with us, perhaps we
   should never bow ourselves with that deep humiliation and prostration
   of spirit which is necessary for our good as well for His glory. I am
   sure that any of us who have passed through this state of mind, feel it
   a privilege to bow down before Him. All hail, Jesus! We bring forth the
   royal diadem and crown You Lord of All. We wish not to dispute Your
   sovereignty, nor to interfere with Your absolute dominion. Give Him all
   the glory! Give Him all the honor. Our spirit bows down with even
   deeper reverence than the cherubim, who bow before Him with veiled
   faces, crying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth."

   Besides, my dear Friends, Joseph's brothers would not have been
   convinced of their sin at all, if it had not been for this. It was
   necessary that they should know the greatness of the wrong, that they
   might know the value of the free pardon. The delay of manifested mercy
   has done much good to many of the saints. It compelled them to search
   the fountains of the great deep of their natural depravity, and led
   them to admire the freeness and richness of Divine Grace. We should
   have been but poor fools in Christ's school if it had not been for the
   rod with which He whipped us, and the ruler with which He knocked our
   knuckles in our early days.

   That black board of conviction was a useful implement enough in the
   school house. If He had not plowed deep, there never would have been a
   hundred-fold harvest. Since He would build a high house of joy in our
   hearts, there was a need that He should dig out deep foundations of
   sorrow--and He did it for our lasting and perpetual good. Could John
   Bun-yan have ever written "Pilgrim's Progress," if he had not felt
   abounding sin, and rejoiced in "Grace abounding"? Could he have ever
   compiled such a wondrous work as the "Holy War," if he had not himself
   felt all the attacks which the Town of Mansoul knew and heard the
   beating of the Hell drum in his own ears, just as the Mansoulians did,
   whose tale he tells?

   Masters of Divinity are not to be made by shallow experience. We make
   not sailors on dry land, nor veterans in times of peace. Christ's
   rugged warriors who shall do great exploits for Him, must be like the
   Spartan youths. They must be brought up by a Spartan training, and
   flogged, and made to bear the yoke in their youth, that afterwards they
   may be good soldiers of Christ, able to endure hardness and to achieve
   great victories. This that looks so cruel in Christ is only masked
   mercy. He puts the visor on His face and looks like an enemy, but a
   friendly heart is there still towards His chosen.

   Let us remember, then, if we are today guilty and moaning our
   guiltiness--we ought not to forget that Christ is a Brother though He
   seems to be an enemy, that He loves us with a pure and perfect love
   though He speaks harshly to us. If He does not answer our prayers, He
   still intends to. If no pity or compassion are expressed, yet beyond a
   doubt He is not flinty of soul, nor is He hard to be moved to
   commiserate His children.

   III. I now come to the last point, and here may God be pleased to let
   light break in upon darkened souls. JOSEPH

   AFTERWARDS REVEALED HIMSELF TO HIS BROTHERS, AND SO THE LORD JESUS DOES
   IN DUE TIME

   SWEETLY REVEAL HIMSELF TO POOR CONSCIENCE-STRICKEN PENITENT SINNERS.

   The reading of the chapter which we heard this morning is enough to
   bring tears to all eyes that are connected with tender hearts. I must
   acknowledge that when reading the chapter in my own study, I could not
   resist weeping copiously at the picture which the Holy Spirit has so
   admirably drawn. Those ten, poor trembling brothers. Judah's speech
   just finished and all of them on their knees supplicating the clearing
   of the court house and then Joseph, whose soul was swelling with such
   grief and love, bursting out with that, "I am Joseph."

   What a scene for tender souls! Though he must have spoken in deep
   affection, yet, "I am Joseph," must have fallen on their ears like
   thunder. "Joseph! Where are we now? Better for us that we were in a
   lion's den, than here with him whom we mocked, saying, 'Behold, this
   dreamer comes,' with him whom we sold and dipped his coat of many
   colors in blood. And then took it to his father, saying, 'See whether
   this is your son's coat or not.' " Well might they tremble!

   And then look at the tenderness of Joseph when he says to them again,
   while they are retiring from him afraid, "I am Joseph, your brother,
   whom you sold into Egypt, I pray you come near to me." You hear his
   pathetic speech as he discovers his brotherhood and relationship, and
   then you see that generous embrace when, beginning with Benjamin, his
   next of kin, his own uterine brother, he afterwards weeps with all the
   rest and sends them home with favors, enriched and happy.

   Dear Friends, I say this is but a picture of what Christ does to some
   of us, and of what He is prepared to do to others of you who are
   trembling at His feet. Notice that this discovery was made secretly.
   Christ does not show Himself to sinners in a crowd. Every man must see
   the love of Christ for himself. We go to Hell in bundles, but we go to
   Heaven one by one. Each man must personally know in his own heart his
   own guilt--and privately and secretly, where no other heart can join
   with him--he must hear words of love from Christ. "Go and sin no more."
   "Your sins which are many are all forgiven you."

   Mark, that as this was done in secret, the first thing Joseph showed
   them was his name. "I am Joseph." Blessed is that day to the sinner
   when Christ says to him, "I am Jesus, I am the Savior." When the soul
   discerns instead of the Lawgiver, the Redeemer. When it looks to the
   wounds which its own sin has made, and sees the ransom price flowing in
   drops of gore. When he looks to the head his own iniquity had crowned
   with thorns--and then he sees beaming there a crown of glory provided
   for the sinner! Sinner, poor troubled Sinner, Jesus speaks to you this
   morning, from His very Cross where He bled for You! He says, "I am
   Jesus, look to Me, trust Me and be saved, repose your confidence wholly
   upon Me. I will wash you from your sin, carry you safely through time
   and bring you gloriously in eternity."

   Having revealed his name, the next thing he did was to reveal his
   relationship; "I am Joseph, your brother." Oh, blessed is that heart
   which sees Jesus to be its Brother, bone of our bone, flesh of our
   flesh, the son of Mary as well as the Son of God. Sinner, whom the Holy
   Spirit has awakened, Christ is your Brother! He feels for you, He has a
   fellow sympathy with you in the present pangs that wring your heart. He
   loves you, He loved you before you knew anything of Him. He has given
   you the best proof of that love in that He has redeemed you with His
   blood.

   And revealing his relationship, Joseph also displays his affection.
   "Does my father yet live?" As a brother does, he remember the head of
   the household. Jesus tells you that the brotherhood between His soul
   and yours is not fanciful or metaphorical, but lets His heart go out to
   you. Penitent Sinner, can you believe it? Jesus loves you--loves you
   though you hated Him. Poor awakened Sinner, you think it isn't
   possible? It is. It is not only possible, but certain. He who is
   Heaven's Lord, before whom the angels bow, loves YOU! I remember one
   man who was converted to God, who told me that the means of his
   conversion was hearing a hymn read one Sunday morning in the
   congregation, when we were worshipping in Exeter Hall and that hymn was
   this--"Jesus, lover of my soul."

   And just those words struck him. "Does He love my soul? Oh," said he,
   "nothing had ever broken me before. But the thought that Jesus loved me
   was too much for me. I could not help giving my heart to Him." The old
   school men used to teach that it was impossible for any man to know
   that another loved him without returning the love in some degree. And
   surely, Sinner, though you feel yourself to be the vilest wretch on
   earth, when we tell you that it is, "a faithful saying, and worthy of
   all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,
   even the chief," this should be a reason why your heart should go out
   to Him. He loves you, oh quickened, convicted Sinner! Oh, trust Him,
   and taste that love in your own heart.

   And then will you please notice, that having thus proved his affection,
   Joseph gave them an invitation to approach. "Come near to me, I pray
   you." You are getting away in the corner. You want to hide away in the
   chamber, alone. You do not want to tell anybody about your sorrow.
   Jesus says, "Come near to Me, I pray you. Do not hold your griefs away
   from Me. Tell Me what it is you want. Confess to Me your guilt. Ask Me
   for pardon, if you want it. Come near to Me, do not be afraid. I could
   not smite with a hand that bought you. I could not spurn you with the
   foot that was nailed for you to the tree. Come to Me!"

   Ah, this is the hardest work in the world, to get a sinner to come near
   to Christ. I thought myself that He was such a hard, hard Christ, and
   that He wanted me to do so much before I might come to Him. When I
   heard that gracious message, "Look unto Me and be you saved, all you
   ends of the earth," my heart ventured to look and oh, joy of joys, the
   burden rolled away, the sin was blotted out, my soul stood accepted in
   Christ! "Come near to Me I pray you." Oh that I knew where a broken
   heart was this morning! I think I would point him out and look him in
   the face and say in Jesus' name, "Poor sinner, come near to me, I pray
   you."

   Oh, why do you stay when Jesus invites? Why do you tarry in your
   despair when Jesus bids you come to Him? Shall the prisoner hug his
   chains? Shall the captive cleave to his dungeon? Arise! Be free! Arise,
   He calls you! Sinner, come near to Jesus. Salvation is in Him, and, as
   He bids you, take it.

   I want you to notice again, having given the invitation, what
   consolation Joseph gave! He did not say, "I am not angry with you. I
   forgive you"-- he said something sweeter than that--"Be not angry with
   yourselves," as much as to say, "As for me, you need not question about
   that--be not grieved nor angry with yourselves." So my blessed, my
   adorable Master, says to a poor, cast down, dejected sinner--"As for My
   forgiving you, that is done. My heart is made of tenderness, My heart
   melts with love. Forgive yourself. Be not grieved nor angry with
   yourself--it is true you have sinned, but I have died. It is true you
   have destroyed yourself, but I have saved you. Weep no more. Dry those
   eyes and sing aloud--

   I will praise You every day,
   Now Your anger's turned away.
   Comfortable thoughts arise
   From the bleeding Sacrifice.
   Jesus has become at length
   My Salvation and my strength;
   And His praises shall prolong,
   While I live, my pleasant song.'"

   Dear Friends, last of all, having thus given them the consolation, he
   gave a quietus for their understanding in an explanation. He says, "It
   was not you, it was God that sent me here." So does Christ say to the
   poor soul that feels itself guilty of the Lord's crucifixion. "It was
   not you," says He," it was God that sent Me to preserve your lives with
   a great deliverance. Man was the second agent in Christ's death, but
   God was the great first Worker, for He was delivered by the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God. Man did it to destroy righteousness,
   but God did it to save even the ungodly.

   Man has the crime but God has the triumph. Man rules, but God
   overrules. The gall has become honey, out of the eater has come forth
   sweetness. Death is destroyed by Jesus' death. Hell upturned by Hell's
   blackest deed. Sinner, Christ died to save you with a great
   deliverance, what do you say? Are you willing to come to Him? If so, He
   made you willing. Do you say, "But what is to come?"--to come to Christ
   is to trust Him. Are you willing to renounce yourself and your sin and
   trust Christ, and take Him to have and to hold, for better, for worse,
   through life and through death, in time and in eternity?

   Does your heart say, "Yes"? Will you come to this Man? Shall there be a
   match made of it this morning? Shall your heart be affianced and
   married to Christ? Ah, then, put this ring of promise on your finger
   and go away affianced unto Christ and this is the ring, "Though your
   sins are as scarlet, they shall be as wool, though they are red like
   crimson they shall be whiter than snow." I feel this morning as though
   my Master had given me such a sweet message that I cannot tell it as I
   would, but it may be that there is some soul here that is like a little
   flower which has opened its cup to catch the dew drop and it will be
   good for such a soul.

   It may be there is a heart here that has been in darkness, and though
   it is but a candle I can bring, yet that light shall be pleasant to its
   poor eyes so long used to this horrid gloom. Oh, that some heart here
   would trust the Lord Jesus. Is there none? Must we go back and say in
   the closet, "Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom is the arm
   of the

   Lord revealed?" Surely, there is one. Perhaps it is a stranger here, of
   whom I shall never hear again in this world. Well, but the Lord shall
   hear of it, and He shall have the praise.

   Perhaps it is one that has long sat in this House of Prayer,
   invulnerable up till now. Perhaps the arrow has found a joint in the
   harness. O Soul! By Him that stretches out His arms of love to you and
   by the Divine Grace that moves you now to run into those arms, come to
   Him! "Be not grieved nor angry with yourselves." It was God that put
   Christ to death, that He might save you with a great deliverance. Trust
   Jesus and you are saved, and you shall give Him praise, world without
   end. Amen.

                      An Exhortation By Rev. C.H. Spurgeon

   AND A SALUTATION BY REV. MERLE D'AUBIGNE, OF GENEVA DELIVERED IN THE
   METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 18, 1862.

   "And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when
   kings go forth to battle, that Da vid sent Joab and his servants with
   him and all Israel. And they destroyed the children of Amnion and
   besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem." 2 Samuel 11:1.

   THE last sentence informs us of a circumstance so significant that the
   Holy Spirit has recorded it twice. In the parallel passage in the
   Chronicles, you will find a repetition of the statement that, "David
   tarried at Jerusalem." It had, up to now, been his custom to march at
   the head of his troops. The king of Israel was the commander-in-chief
   of the Lord's hosts, and by personal deeds of prowess excited the
   national spirit. But on this occasion, you perceive, he delegates his
   power to Joab and seeks inglorious ease.

   We are informed that the season had arrived when kings go forth to
   battle--probably the spring, when horses could be maintained by forage
   and when, if a long siege should be necessary, the armies might sit
   down before a city with the prospect of advancing summer and ripening
   harvests. It was a great occasion. For otherwise, how is it that he
   sent all Israel with Joab? A great war had been provoked and most
   important interests were at stake. This makes it the less excusable on
   the part of the king, that he should, when his presence was especially
   necessary, absent himself from his proper post.

   Nor do we think that State affairs needed his presence in Jerusalem. No
   rebellions were hatching. The whole land was quiet and all the tribes
   voluntarily submitted themselves to his sway. It does not seem, from
   the context, that David was at all occupied with State cares. For you
   find that he rises from his bed at eventide. Contrary to the hardier
   custom to which he had accustomed himself in his earlier days, after
   his noontide meal he laid himself down and slept till the sun was
   setting. And when he arose, it was not to succor the poor, or to
   dispense justice, but to take a stroll on the housetop.

   And then, being idle, having put his armor off, the arrow smote
   him--having nothing good to do, the enemy found his awful work. For the
   Tempter planted straight before his eyes a fair temptation, into which
   he rushed as a bird to the snare, or as a bullock to the slaughter.
   Happy would it have been for king David had he been in battle. He would
   not then have known this temptation. Probably if the temptation had
   presented itself, he would have been so occupied with martial cares
   that he would not have fallen a victim.

   Idleness was the mother of the mischief and if you trace it to its
   source, the foul iniquity that has made the name of David a special
   mark for all the Lord's enemies, you will find it had much to do with
   his not going out to battle when the country required it--when the
   season commanded it and when no affairs of State justified his absence.

   You will readily perceive the subject of my address. First, to the
   individual Christian. And secondly, to the Church, as God shall help
   me. I will utter warnings against that deadly lethargy which is so apt
   to steal over us, putting us into a position to be readily assailable
   by temptation, yes, and to be easily overcome by it, too.

   I. To you, BROTHER IN CHRIST, I SPEAK PERSONALLY.

   1. Let me direct your special attention to the season at which this
   temptation to idleness came upon David. Brethren, David never refused
   to go forth to battle while he was harassed by his adversary Saul. So
   long as he is hunted like a partridge upon the mountains, David's
   character is spotless and his zeal is unrivalled. In his religion there
   was an intensity of energy, so long as in his life there was an
   intensity of adversity.

   But now an hour of trial is at hand, Saul is dead and the last of his
   race sits as a humble pensioner at David's table. The son of Jesse is
   no more obliged to frequent the tracks of the wild goats, or to hide
   himself among the glooms of

   Engedi. His great adversary has long ago fallen by the arrows of the
   Philistines upon the mountains of Gilboa. But a stealthier foe is
   lurking in ambush--woe to you, David, if he overcomes you!

   Ah, Christian, it is a dangerous time to you when temptation has ceased
   to harass you, when Satan has left you in peace, and when you have
   placed your foot on your adversary's neck. When the storm has hushed
   itself to sleep, when a dead calm takes the place of the awful
   hurricane, it is then you have need to look well to it, for then your
   soul may lose its former strength and watchfulness and you may decline
   into indifference and Laodicean lukewarmness. While the devil assails
   you on the right hand and on the left, you will hardly be able to rest
   upon the couch of carnal security.

   The dog of Hell, by barking in your ears, keeps you awake. But when he
   shall cease his howling, your eyelids will grow heavy, unless Divine
   Grace prevents it. When you are no more driven to your knees by furious
   assaults from Hell, you may experience the still more terrible trials
   of the enchanted ground and you will have good cause to cry out, "Lord
   let me not sleep as do others, but let me watch and be sober." Yet
   again, David at this time had obtained the crown and it was sitting
   softly and securely upon his head.

   Dear Friends, far from depreciating the full assurance of faith, we
   know that it is our strength and our joy. But there is a temptation
   connected with it. The Christian is apt to say, "Now I am saved, I have
   no doubt about it. For the crown of my salvation encircles my head
   right royally." Believer, be on your watchtower, for the next
   temptation will be, "Soul, take your ease. The work is done. You have
   attained. Now fold your arms and sit still. All will end well, why do
   you need to vex yourself?" Take care of the seasons when you have no
   doubts." "Let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall."

   "I said, I shall never be moved. Lord, by Your favor You have made my
   mountain to stand strong--you did hide Your face and I was troubled."
   Bless God for full assurance. But, remember, nothing but careful
   walking can preserve it. Full assurance is a priceless pearl. But when
   a man has a precious jewel, and he walks the streets, he ought to be
   much afraid of pickpockets. When the Christian has full assurance let
   him be assured that all the devils in Hell will try to rob him of it.
   Let him be more upon his watchtower than he was before. This is the
   temptation of assured Believers--to sit down upon the throne and
   say--"I shall I sit in my glory forever and see no sorrow. I need no
   more go forth to fight the Lord's battles."

   Yet further--it appears that at this time David was at the height of
   his prosperity. He had attained to about fifty years of age. The year
   of his jubilee was come and everything went on jubilantly. Wherever he
   turned his hand, he prospered. "Moab is my wash pot; over Edom will I
   cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph." He could boast
   exceedingly, for God was with him in all his ways. Ah, dear Friends,
   when a Christian prospers, it is an ill time for him, unless he is on
   his watchtower.

   "In all time of our wealth, good Lord deliver us." When a man is poor,
   when he is sick, when he is tried in his estate, he has need of Divine
   Grace. But when he is rich, when his business succeeds and he and his
   family are in good health and all is well, he has need of Grace upon
   Grace. It is hard standing in high places. The brain grows dizzy with
   looking down. It is not easy to carry a full cup with a steady hand.
   Smooth places are slippery places. Let us beware, lest when we get
   full, Jeshurun waxes fat and kicks against the Lord.

   Summer weather breeds flies. Fair weather in the soul brings out the
   evils and mischiefs of our nature. Heat hatches the cockatrice eggs and
   the heat of prosperity often brings out the young serpents of sin. See
   to it, lest, like David, you refuse to go forth to battle because you
   are prospering in the world.

   To complete the tragedy, David had now the opportunity of indulging
   himself in all the luxuries of life. He had a palace with all the
   accompaniments of oriental magnificence. He was no more the humble
   shepherd eating a crust from his wallet--no more the chieftain of an
   outlawed clan, depending upon such churlish husbandmen as Nabal for
   temporary assistance. The fat of the land was his, the vintage of
   Ephraim, the corn of Judah, and the dainties brought from afar, from
   Tyre and Sidon--all were his.

   He could be clothed in scarlet and fine linen and fare sumptuously
   every day--then it was that his soul grew lean, while the flesh was
   pampered. Fat steeds sometimes will not work. Birds too well fed refuse
   to sing. And so does it happen when the riches of the earth are ours
   freely to enjoy, and the blessings of Divine Providence are poured out
   of the cornucopia of Divine munificence, that we refuse to do the
   Lord's work, and, like David, go not out to battle.

   Dear Friends, I know that my sermon is pertinent to some of you. I
   would that I could portray the individuals so clearly that they could
   not allot to others the rebuke intended for themselves. It is a well
   known fact that when some people get rich in gold they grow poor in
   grace. They rise in the eyes of the world and sink in the esteem of
   their heavenly Lord. Things which Believers were glad to undertake when
   they were little in Israel, they cannot look upon when they have grown
   great among the inhabitants of Zion. Certain folks, when they can keep
   a carriage, are ashamed to frequent the meeting house. They must go to
   some more respectable place of worship.

   The Truth of God was respectable enough for them when they loved
   it--but now they love the honor of men more than Christ. They can
   hoodwink their consciences and unite with worldly Churches, who love
   architecture, scholarship and pomp, more than the Truth of God and
   holiness. "God grant," said one of Wesley's followers, "that the
   Methodists may never grow rich." And I think I might well say, God
   grant the Baptists never may. O Lord, give them neither poverty nor
   riches but especially let them not grow too respectable to associate
   with the poor of the land!

   Why, there are some of you who, when you joined this Church, were as
   earnest as you could be--and where are you now? There are some that
   were prominent in the prayer meeting--how often do we see them now? Are
   there not many among us as miserly towards the Lord's cause as if they
   did not care a rush for it? You will say I am personal. Brethren, I
   mean to be and want to be. And if you feel that this is your case,
   instead of being offended at the honest rebuke now offered to you,
   solemnly thank God that it comes home to you!

   Earnestly retrace your steps, be no more sluggish and sleepy but for
   the sake of Him who loves you with an everlasting love, once more cast
   your souls into His cause and go forth to fight your Lord's battles.
   Away with your downy dozing and comfortable slumbers. Lord, arouse us
   by a thunderbolt from Heaven! When Christians have learned the doctrine
   but begin to forget the practice, when they have a little smattering of
   experience and think they are the men and wisdom shall die with
   them--when they despise the broken-hearted and timid--there is but a
   step between them and a fall.

   Oh, you who are in such a condition, I solemnly warn you. I sound this
   day an alarm in Zion. Arise! Arise, you slum-berers upon your soft
   couches, for if you slumber now, you shall one day awake and find
   yourselves upon the verge of destruction and only the Sovereign Grace
   of God shall bring you back as David was brought back, and restore you
   once again to the right way, to journey with broken bones to your tomb,
   sorrowing because of your sin.

   2. Observe, my Brethren, that there are certain tendencies abroad which
   will co-operate with the dangers of the occasion, and unless the
   Christian is very watchful, will lead him into David's vice of
   slothfulness. Brethren, what would the flesh do with some of us but
   make us, if we would let it have its way, as idle as Solomon's
   sluggard? I do confess, there is, perhaps, no man living that has a
   stronger temptation to sheer idleness than myself, although I am no
   boaster when I say I labor as hard as any man in either hemisphere.

   Alas, for this body of sin and death, it is hard for a man to serve the
   Lord aright while imprisoned in it. Brethren, you will find that not
   only the mere flesh, but the lusting of the mind will naturally lead
   you to be cold in Christ's work. Enthusiasm is not the tendency of
   Englishmen in matters of religion. Only the Spirit of God can give the
   tongue of fire, and the rushing mighty wind to the assembled disciples.
   The flesh lusts continually towards inaction. The inertia of matter
   reaches its height in the corruption of humanity.

   We lift up our souls unto God but we fall down again to the earth, for
   our nature has in it more of the sinking of a millstone than the
   mounting of an eagle. Well does Watts put it--

   "Look, how we grovel here below, fond of these trifling toys-- Our
   souls can neither fly nor go to reach eternal joys." Brethren, your
   unmortified flesh will make you idle enough, without any other tempter.

   Then there is Satan. He will take care to sing your lullaby and rock
   your cradle if you want to sleep, for he loves not to see God's
   warriors on the alert. While they are all asleep, he knows the war will
   not go on very briskly. An army dosed with chloroform would be quite as
   useless as if they were chained and manacled. While swords sleep in
   scabbards, no foe needs dread them. Ah, my fellow Soldiers, this is a
   great artifice of Satan, and one of his craftiest devices to lull us
   all into a deep sleep.

   Besides, you will find the world has a great tendency to make you cold
   and dead. What do you feel, Brethren, after some few hours of
   intermeddling with business? Is not this vain world a foe to Divine
   Grace? Unless you are very spiritu- ally minded, do you not find that
   the world has a down-dragging tendency? I ask the workers, the
   merchants, the thinkers--do you not find that secular occupations,
   unless you are exceedingly careful in consecrating them to God--have a
   tendency to stain the garments of your priesthood and bring you down
   from your high standing?

   The world is to the Christian an ice house and he a tender plant that
   has been the gardener's special care. I would give nothing for that
   Christian who loves to be in worldly company. I think if any man can
   find himself quite at home with ungodly persons, he must be one of
   them. And if even with merely moral persons he can find a settled rest,
   surely there can be nothing of the high and aspiring nature within him
   that belongs to the true-born heir of Heaven.

   But, Brethren, I am sorry to have to add one more thing. Even
   association with some portions of the Church of God, in its present
   state, may cool the ardor of piety. Ecclesiastical lethargy is perhaps
   one of the greatest stumbling blocks to young Believers. I am not
   staggered by the world's indifference to religion, for I can understand
   it--but the indifference of the Church to the progress of Jesus'
   kingdom is an enigma which one cannot solve. Many a young enthusiastic
   Christian has had the noble spirit of Christ all but crushed out of him
   by seeing the dullness and deadness of older saints, who seemed to be
   pillars in the temple of God.

   Oh, have we not heard our young Davids saying concerning our foes, "Who
   is this Philistine? I will go against him and smite off his head"? But
   a veteran Eliab in the Church has said, "Because of the pride and the
   naughtiness of your heart is why you have come to see the battle." When
   he is brought before a Saul-like minister, he says, "Well, young man,
   you are enthusiastic, you must not attempt to do the Lord's work by
   simple faith, you must put this helmet on and carry this spear, you
   must wear this leg armor of brass."

   And the poor young man, with almost enthusiasm enough in him to melt
   the armor off his back, has to go out to sure defeat, wearing untried
   weapons which prove his ruin. Oh, give us back the glorious days when
   the Church was a pillar of fire and when every new member was a new
   coal added to the glowing mass! Give us back even the stakes of
   Smithfield, if we might have the fiery energy of the first Reformers!
   Visit us anew with persecution, if we can but renew the diligent
   prosecution of the ends and aims of the Church of Christ! Let our foes
   grow angry if we may but grow zealous.

   3. To pass on rapidly to the third point. What happened through David's
   tarrying at home? Some men think it a small thing to be doing nothing
   for Christ. It is a great thing and will be a damnable thing, unless
   God gives you repentance. What happened, I say, to David? Why, now that
   he was tarrying at home and giving himself up to sloth, he was losing
   his usefulness and honor by no more fighting the Lord's battles. No
   more triumphs were being written in the Book of the Chronicles of the
   Kings of Judah. And even Joab had to send for him to come in at the end
   of the fray to take the city, lest it should be called by Joab's name.

   Is it a little thing for a follower of Christ to be losing the immortal
   honor of serving the Lord? What will not men do to win fame? And shall
   we, when it lies at our doors, turn aside to our beds of ease and cast
   our glory to the grooms? Let us be up and doing--for it is no light
   thing for a faithful servant of Christ to be losing the honor of
   serving his Master.

   David lost his communion and joy. A man cannot be idle and yet have
   Christ's sweet company. Christ is a quick walker and when His people
   would talk with Him they must travel quickly, too, or else they will
   soon lose His company. Christ, my Master, goes about doing good and if
   you would walk with Him you must go about upon the same mission. The
   Almighty lover of the souls of men is not likely to keep company with
   idle persons. I find in Scripture that most of the great appearances
   that were made to eminent saints were made when they were busy.

   Moses kept his father's flock when he saw the burning bush. Joshua is
   going round about the city of Jericho when he meets the Angel of the
   Lord. Jacob is in prayer and the Angel of God appears to him. Gideon is
   threshing and Elisha is plowing, when the Lord calls them. Matthew is
   in the receipt of customs when he is bid to follow Jesus--James and
   John are fishing. The manna which the children of Israel kept till
   morning bred worms and stank--idle grace would soon become active
   corruption.

   Moreover, sloth hardens the conscience--laziness is one of the irons
   with which the heart is seared. Abimelech hired vain and light persons
   to serve his turn, and the Prince of Darkness does the same. Oh,
   Friends, it is a sad thing to rust the edge off from one's mind and to
   lose keenness of moral perception! But sloth will surely do this for
   us. David felt the emasculating power of sloth. He was losing the force
   of his conscience and was ready for anything. The worst is near at
   hand.

   He walks upon the housetop and sees the object which excites his lust.
   He sends for the woman, the deed is done. It leads to another crime, he
   tempts Uriah. It leads to murder--Uriah is put to death. And he takes
   Uriah's wife. Ah, David! Ah, David! How are the mighty fallen! How is
   the Prince of Israel fallen and become like the lewd fellows who riot
   in the evening! From this day forth his sunshine turns to clouds, his
   peace gives place to suffering, and he goes to his grave an afflicted
   and troubled man, who, though he could say, "God has made with me an
   Everlasting Covenant," yet had to precede it with that very significant
   sentence, "Although my house is not so with God."

   Dear Friends, is there anyone here among the Lord's people who would
   crucify the Lord afresh and put Him to an open shame? Is there anyone
   among you that would wish to sell your Master, as Judas did, or turn
   aside from Christ with Demas? It is easy to do. Oh, you say, you could
   not do it. Now, perhaps you could not. Get slothful. Do not fight the
   Lord's battles--and it will become not only easy for you to sin, but
   you will surely become its victim. Oh, how Satan delights to make God's
   people fall into sin! For then he does, as it were, thrust another nail
   into the bloody hand of Christ.

   Then he does stain the fair white linen of Christ's own garment. Then
   he vaunts himself that he has gotten a victory over the Lord Jesus and
   has led one of the Master's favorites captive at his will! Oh, if we
   would not thus make Hell ring with Satanic laughter and make the men of
   God weep because the cedars of Lebanon are cut down, let us watch unto
   prayer and be diligent in our Master's business, "fervent in spirit,
   serving the Lord."

   My dear Friends, we do not exhort you to serve Christ, to be saved by
   it. David was saved. I only speak to you who are saved, and I beg and
   beseech you to take notice of David's fall--and of the sloth that was
   at the beginning of it--as a warning to yourselves. Some temptations
   come to the industrious but all temptations attack the idle. Notice the
   invention used by country people to catch wasps. They will put a little
   sweet liquor into a long and narrow-necked phial. The do-nothing wasp
   comes by, smells the sweet liquor, plunges in and is drowned.

   But the bee comes by, and if she does stop for a moment to smell, yet
   she enters not, because she has honey of her own to make. She is too
   busy in the work of the commonwealth to indulge herself with the
   tempting sweets. Master Green-ham, a Puritan Divine, was once waited
   upon by a woman who was greatly tempted. Upon making enquiries into her
   way of life, he found she had little to do, and Greenham said, "That is
   the secret of your being so much tempted. Sister, if you are very busy,
   Satan may tempt you, but he will not easily prevail, and he will soon
   give up the attempt."

   Idle Christians are not tempted of the devil so much as they do tempt
   the devil to tempt them. Idleness sets the door of the heart ajar and
   asks Satan to come in. But if we are occupied from morning till night,
   if Satan shall get in, he must break through the door. Under Sovereign
   Grace and next to faith, there is no better shield against temptation
   than being, "Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the
   Lord." And, dear Friends, let me remind those of you who are doing
   little for Christ, that once you were not so cold as this.

   There was a time with David when the sound of the clarion of war would
   have stirred his blood and he would have been eager for the fray. There
   was a day when the very sight of Israel marshaled in goodly phalanx
   would have made David bold as a lion. Oh, it is an ill thing to see the
   lion changed like this! God's hero stays at home with the women! There
   was a time when you would have gone over hedge and ditch to hear a
   sermon and never minded standing in the aisles. But now the sermons are
   tedious to some of you, although you have soft cushions to sit upon.

   Then if there was a cottage meeting, or a street preaching, you were
   there. "Ah," you say, "that was wildfire." Blessed wildfire! The Lord
   give you the wildfire back again. For even if it is wildfire, better
   wildfire than no fire at all-- better be called a fanatic than deserve
   to be called a drone in Christ's hive. Those of you who do very little
   for your Mas-ter--and there are a few such in this Church, who grudge
   to give of their substance--let me say to you, Are you not ashamed to
   see how the Lord's other servants serve Him? When Uriah said to David,
   "The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in tents. And my lord Joab and
   the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields. Shall I then
   go into my house, to eat and to drink? As you live and as your soul
   lives, I will not do this thing." When he said that, methinks the king
   must have felt very uneasy in his luxurious sloth.

   What do you say to this, some of you? You, who were once the chief of
   sinners, are now saved by Divine Grace. You have had high privileges,
   great tastes of love, near fellowship with Him--you are His own elect,
   anointed, taken up from the dunghill and made to sit among princes! And
   yet you are doing next to nothing for Christ. Oh, dear Friends, I would
   not so much bid you to think over these things, as beseech the Holy
   Spirit to lay these matters to your hearts--that you may not sleep any
   longer--but being of the day, may do the day's work, till the day shall
   end!

   II. I shall occupy but a few minutes more, while I endeavor to speak of
   the text as it refers to THE WHOLE CHURCH. For I think it has a loud
   voice to the whole of us as a community. Strangers and members of other
   Churches must kindly forget that they are here. I am not about to speak
   to them but I am about to speak to you--the two thousand members of
   this Church under my care, to whom I am bound most of all to speak
   personally and faithfully.

   My dear Friends, it does seem to me that to us as a Church the
   temptation to sloth is very likely to come, for we are very much in the
   same condition as David. Our enemies do not harass us so much as they
   once did. When the Parliament is over, we shall have certain newspapers
   abusing us again, for when they have nothing else to say, they fill up
   with abusing us. But there was a time when we had no friends. We look
   back some eight years ago, when the Church of Christ was very shy of
   us--we were innovators, preaching in those wicked music halls.

   It was such a very awful thing to preach the Gospel where people would
   come to hear it! It was going contrary to the customs of the Christian
   Church to carry the Gospel to poor sinners. And good people, holy
   people, and godly people, thought we were sinners above all sinners on
   earth. And if an accident did occur, if the tower of Siloam fell, how
   plainly were we told that we deserved the catastrophe. Then there were
   sneers everywhere, caricatures, jeers, jibes of all sorts-- and you all
   had to suffer, each your share, with your leader.

   To a great extent that is over. The clergy of the Church of England do
   now what it was once infamous for us to do. Now the theater hears the
   voice of Christ. Now the cathedrals echo with the holy hymn--blessed be
   God for all this! We enjoy a degree of peacefulness and have not now
   all the world against us, as once we had. Now we shall be tempted to
   fold our arms and say, Let us subside into the easy respectability of
   other congregations and let it be well with us.

   During all the time God has been pleased to favor us with profound
   peace in the Church. We have been disturbed by no word of ill-doctrine,
   by no uprising of heretics in our midst, or any separations or
   divisions. This is a blessed thing-- but still Satan may make it a
   dangerous matter. We may begin to think that there is no need for us to
   watch, that we shall always be as we are. And deacons and elders, and
   pastor and Church members, may all cease their vigilance--and then the
   root of bitterness may spring up in the neglected corner till it gets
   too deeply rooted for us to tear it up again.

   We have accomplished, as a Church, and by God's Divine Grace, the great
   work which we set for ourselves--the building of this House of Prayer.
   And now we come to our place in our loved House of Prayer and feel the
   Master's presence with us. But without a grand object before our eyes
   imperatively demanding self-sacrifice from each one of us, as this
   object did--without some enterprise which we can all lay hold of and
   feel that we could give our last shilling to carry it out
   successfully--we are apt to grow rusty.

   We will be tempted to lean upon our weapons instead of using them, and
   to withdraw from the Lord's host instead of rushing on to battle with
   the shout of men who mean to win the victory. Ah, give us back again
   all the noise and the confusion and the strife! Let us have once more
   the coldness and the harshness and evil speaking of the entire Church
   of God, if we may but have our early enthusiasm and earnestness for
   Christ. Our work of educating men for the ministry may supply the
   object for our zeal--may the Lord give zeal for the object!

   Dear Friends, let me say solemnly, there are many tendencies to make
   this Church sleep. We come frequently into contact with professed
   Believers who will throw cold water upon every effort--who think doing
   anything for Christ a work of supererogation. And there is a tendency
   in us to go with them and to say, "Let it be so. Let us be quiet." It
   is almost necessary for the Church that, at least once in a hundred
   years, there should arise in it some new body of enthusiasts. For the
   old Churches, though noble at the start, like all human things, flag
   before long.

   Why, Methodism, though still most powerful, has nothing like the fire
   it had in Wesley's and Whitfield's time. It is now no more like a great
   volcano sending up torrents of holy fire to Heaven in prayer and
   sending down streams of all-consuming lava into the plains of sin. It
   has grown respectable and learned and fine. So with each of the
   Churches. Do they not all degenerate? No matter whether it is England,
   America, France, Switzerland--wherever it may be, there is a
   down-drawing tendency constantly at work. And unless God the Holy
   Spirit comes in with irresistible might, we shall as a Church succumb
   to general lethargy and yield ourselves to apathy.

   What shall we do, as a Church, then? Let us take heed to our footsteps,
   everyone of us, and be doubly careful--let us meet together in greater
   numbers for prayer. Let each man feel more and more his individual
   responsibility to Christ. Let us weigh the awful necessities of this
   huge city. Let us put out every energy and use every agency that can
   possibly be employed for the regeneration of this dark, dark land.

   If we grow idle. If the Church of Christ universally shall grow idle,
   we cannot expect that our enemies will be idle, too. Once the Light
   said to the Darkness, "I am growing weary with shooting my arrows every
   morning at you, O Darkness! I am weary with pursuing you around the
   globe continually. I will retire, if you will." But the Darkness said,
   "No, it is of necessity that if you yield your dominion I shall take
   it. There can be no truce between you and me."

   Friends, I might address the members of this Church as it is said an
   old Scotch Commander once addressed his soldiers when he saw the enemy
   coming. This was his brief, terse speech--"Lads," said he, "there they
   are, and if you dinna kill them they will kill you." Look, members of
   the Church. If you do not put down lethargy and sloth, if you strive
   not against Popery, infidelity and Sin, they will put you down. There
   is no other alternative. To conquer or to die. To live and to be
   glorious. Or to fall ignobly.

   Look! Jehovah lifts His banner before our eyes today! Rally! Rally!
   Rally, you soldiers of the Cross! The trumpet sounds exceedingly loud
   and long today. And the Hell drum on the other side sounds, too. Who
   dares to hesitate? Let him be accursed. "Curse you, Meroz, curse you,
   Meroz," says the Lord, "curse you bitterly the inhabitants thereof, if
   they come not up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord
   against the mighty. He that is not with Me is against Me. He that
   gathers not with Me scatters abroad."

   Away with you, you indifferent ones! Know you not you are either on
   Christ's side or else you are His adversaries? On! The charge
   comes--forward, heroes of Heaven! What shall become of those who are
   midway between the two armies? Over you, over you--troops shall trample
   on your bodies! You shall be the first to be cut in pieces--O you
   indifferent ones--who are neither this nor that! And then shall come
   the shock and then the charge. And as in that conflict you shall have
   no portion, so in that great triumph which shall surely follow, you
   shall have no share.

   I will give way to my friend, Mr. D'Aubigne, who will address you for a
   few minutes, when I have simply reminded those who are not in Christ's
   army, that with them there is something to come before service, "Except
   you repent and are converted, you shall in no wise enter into the
   kingdom of Heaven." The door to that kingdom is Christ--trust Him and
   you are saved. "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved
   and your house."

   My dear Friend, Dr. D'Aubigne, is here this morning, having been called
   by the Bishop of London, according to the order of our Beloved Queen,
   to preach in the Royal Chapel of St. James. In a kind note with which
   he favored me last week, he expressed a desire publicly to show his
   hearty fellowship with his Brethren of the Free Churches of England and
   I am delighted to welcome him in the Tabernacle this morning--in the
   name of this Church, and I may venture to add, in the name of all the
   Free Churches of England. May the Historian of the Reformation continue
   to be honored of the Lord his God!

   DR. MERLE D'AUBIGNE--I do not speak your tongue, my dear Friends--I
   speak it very badly but I will do what I can to make myself understood.
   When I heard your dear pastor reading to us the 16th chapter of the
   Romans, I remembered those words which we find very often in the
   Epistles of Paul--"Love to the saints," and "Faith in the Lord." In the
   16th chapter we find a beautiful exhibition of the love to the saints,
   the children of God.

   We see it was written from the Church of Corinth, in Greece, to the
   Church of Rome. Observe how many Christians that Church of Corinth and
   the Apostle knew at Rome! We have a long catalog of names--Priscilla,
   Aquila, Andronicus and others. I must confess, my dear Friends, to my
   shame, that in this great assembly I know only two or three names. I
   know the name of our dear Friend, Mr. Spurgeon. I know the name but not
   the person, of Mr. North, upon my left, and I know the name of the
   friend who has received me in your great city, Mr. Kinnaird, "Gaius, my
   host," as the Apostle says.

   But in this great assembly of six thousand men and women and I hope
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ, I do not know another name. Well, my
   dear Friends, I would ask you, do you know the names of many Christians
   in Geneva? You do not know perhaps three, perhaps two, perhaps one.
   Now, that is to me a demonstration that fraternity, or brotherly love,
   is not so intense in our time as it was in the time of the Apostles. In
   the first century, for a man to give his name to the Lord was to expose
   himself to martyrdom.

   And Christians in that time formed only one household in the whole
   world, in Europe, Asia and Africa. Let us remember that, and may we, by
   the Holy Spirit, say that we who have been baptized with the blood and
   the Spirit of the Lord, have only one Father, one Savior, one Spirit,
   one faith--and we are only one house, the house of the living God, the
   house of Christ, one house of the Holy Spirit in the whole world. Not
   only in Europe, Asia, and Africa, but in America, in Australia, one
   house, one family. Oh, my dear Brethren, let us grow in the love to the
   Brethren!

   Then there is another thing, faith--faith in the Lord Jesus. There can
   be no love to the saved and the redeemed, if there is no true living
   faith and hope in the Savior and the Redeemer. Well, I suppose all of
   you in this great meeting would say, "We believe in the Lord, we have
   faith in Him." Yes, but that faith must be sincere, must be living,
   must come from the heart. I will tell you one word from Rome. Probably
   all these friends sent some words to the Apostle, but I will tell you
   one word that was said once in Rome, not at the time of Paul but at the
   time of our blessed Reformation.

   There was in the latter part of the sixteenth century, a man in Italy,
   who was a child of God, taught by the Spirit. His name was Aonio
   Paleario. He had written a book called, "The Benefit of Christ's
   Death." That book was destroyed in Italy, and for three centuries it
   was not possible to find a copy. But two or three years ago, an Italian
   copy was found, I believe, in one of your libraries at Cambridge or
   Oxford and it has been printed again. It is perhaps singular, but this
   man did not, as he ought to have done, leave the Romish Church. But his
   whole heart was given to Christ.

   He was brought before the judge in Rome by order of the pope. The judge
   said, "We will put to him three questions. We will ask him what is the
   first cause of salvation, then what is the second cause of salvation,
   then what is the third cause of salvation." They thought that in
   putting these three questions, he would at last be made to say
   something which should be to the glory of the Church of Rome. They
   asked him, "What is the first cause of salvation?" And he answered,
   "Christ.''" They then asked him, "What is the second cause of
   salvation?" And he answered, "CHRIST."

   And they asked him the third time, "What is the third cause of
   salvation?" and he answered, "CHRIST." They thought he would have said,
   first, Christ. Secondly, the Word. Thirdly, the Church. But no, he
   said, "Christ." The first cause, Christ. The second, Christ. The third,
   Christ. And for that confession which he made in Rome, he was condemned
   to be put to death as a martyr. My dear Friends, let us think and speak
   like that man. Let everyone of us say, "The first cause of my salvation
   is Christ. The second is Christ. The third is Christ. Christ and His
   atoning blood, Christ and His powerful regenerating Spirit, Christ and
   His eternal electing Grace, Christ is my only salvation, I know of
   nothing else."

   Dear Friends, we find in the Epistle to the Romans these words--"The
   whole Church salutes you." I have no official charge but I may in a
   Christian and fraternal spirit say to you, the Geneva Church, the
   Church in Geneva salutes you. And I would say, the whole Continental
   Church salutes you, for we know you, and we love you and the dear
   minister God has given you. Now we ask from you love towards us. We do
   what we can in that dark Continent to bring forward the light of Jesus
   Christ.

   In Geneva we have an Evangelical Society which has that work before it
   and in other places we are also laboring. We ask for our work an
   interest in your prayers, for the work is hard among the Roman
   Catholics and the infidels of the Continent. But as our Brother, in the
   beginning of the service, reminded you--from the little town of Geneva
   light came, by the Grace of the Spirit, to many nations and especially
   to England and Scotland, by the ministry of John Calvin, our Reformer.

   I may mention to you that upon the tri-centenary anniversary of the
   death of Calvin, which will take place in two years, on the 27th of
   May, 1864, we desire to erect in Geneva a monument to the blessed
   Reformation and to the Reformer who has been the instrument of God in
   promoting the true doctrine, not only in Geneva, but in a great many
   countries. And I ask also your interest in that work and in that spot
   which has been blessed since the 16th century, for Switzerland, for
   France, for the Netherlands, for Germany, for England, for Scotland,
   and is now blessed for the United States and for the ends of the earth.
   I beg of you, dear Friends, your deep interest and your earnest prayers
   for us. The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all! Amen.

                                Choice Portions

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 25, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For the Lord's portion is His people." Deuteronomy 32:9.
   "The Lord is my portion, says my soul." Lamentations 3:24.
   The love of God changes us into its own image, so that what the Lord
   says concerning us, we also can declare concerning Him. God is love
   essentially, and when this essential love shines forth freely upon us,
   we reflect it back upon Him. He is like the sun, the great father of
   lights, and we are as the moon and the planets--we shine in rays
   borrowed from His brightness. He is the golden seal, and we, His
   people, are the wax receiving the impression.
   Our Heaven is to be likeness to Christ and our preparation for Heaven
   consists in a growing imitation of Him in all things. See, Brethren,
   how the Lord gives the Word, and our heart, like an echo, repeats every
   syllable. The Lord loves His people and we love Him because He first
   loved us. He has chosen His saints and they also have made Him their
   chosen heritage. The saints are precious to Jesus and unto us who
   believe He is precious. Christ lived for us, and for us to live is
   Christ--we gain all things by His death and for us to die is gain.
   The Church is the looking glass in which Christ sees Himself reflected.
   She is like a fair songstress taking up the refrain of Jesus' canticles
   of love, while He sings, "My sister, My spouse," she answers, "My
   Beloved is mine and I am His." It is most delightful to perceive how,
   through Divine Grace, Believers come to have the same feeling towards
   their God which their gracious Lord has towards them.
   Our two texts present us with an interesting instance--the Church is
   God's portion--He delights in her, He finds in her His solace and His
   joy. But God is also, as the result of this, the Church's portion--her
   full delight and bliss. Beloved, the love is mutual. And whereas the
   Lord is married to His people, we perceive that it is no forced match
   on either side. He voluntarily gave Himself to her and she joyfully
   surrenders her all to Him. His whole heart He gave unto His chosen
   people, and now they as voluntarily, though led by Divine Grace, give
   themselves to Him. And while He clasps His Church in His arms, saying,
   "You are My portion," she returns the embrace and rapturously cries,
   "You are my portion, O Lord."

   As God shall help me, and relying only on His Divine assistance, I
   shall try to work out these two texts at some length. We shall commence
   with, "The Lord's portion.''" We will then proceed to the second, "His
   people's portion.''" I. "THE LORD'S PORTION IS HIS PEOPLE."

   1. The text teaches us that the Church of God is the Lord's own
   peculiar and special property. "The earth is the Lord's and the
   fullness thereof. The world and they that dwell therein." By creation,
   as well as by Providence, Jehovah is the liege Lord and Sovereign
   possessor of the entire universe. Let none venture to dispute His
   claims, or say that He is not the great Owner of all things, for thus
   says the Lord, "Behold, all souls are Mine." But He has a special
   property in His Church.

   As a king may have ample possessions, to all of which he has undoubted
   right, still he has royal mansions and crown lands which are in a very
   special sense his own. So has the Lord of All a peculiar interest in
   His saints. As Osborne and Balmoral and Windsor belong to our sovereign
   by a tenure which differs from her title and claim to the United
   Kingdom, so the Church is the peculiar heritage of the King of kings.
   The whole world is God's by common right. He is Lord of the manor of
   the universe. But His Church is His garden, His cultivated and fenced
   field, and if He should give up His rights to all the rest of the wide
   earth, yet He never could relinquish His rights to His separated
   inheritance. "The Lord's portion is His people."

   How are they His? We answer, first, by His own sovereign choice. Before
   they were fashioned, all creatures lay in His mind's eye in the mass of
   creatureship, and it was in His power to make whom He would as vessels
   unto honor. He did so ordain to make His chosen and set His love upon
   them. When they lay in the impure mass, having all fallen, it was still
   in His power, through the plan of redemption, to raise up some and to
   make these His own special heritage. This He did altogether apart from
   any goodness in them at the time, or any goodness which He foresaw in
   them.

   He had mercy on whom He would have mercy and ordained a chosen company
   into eternal life. These, therefore, are His by election. As our text
   says, Jacob is the lot of His inheritance, or as the Hebrew has it,
   "the cord" of His inheritance, an allusion to the old custom of
   measuring out lots by a line or cord. So by line and by lot the Lord
   has marked off His own chosen people, "and they shall be Mine, says the
   Lord, in the day when I make up My jewels."

   They are not only His by choice, but by purchase. He has bought and
   paid for them to the utmost farthing, so that about His title there can
   be no dispute. Not with corruptible things, as with silver and gold,
   but with the precious blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord's
   portion has been fully redeemed. There is no mortgage on His estate, no
   suits can be raised by opposing claimants, the price was paid in open
   court and the Church is the Lord's freehold forever.

   See the blood-mark upon all the chosen, invisible to human eye but
   known to Christ, for "the Lord knows them that are His"? He forgets
   none of those whom He has redeemed from among men. He counts the sheep
   for whom He laid down His life and remembers well the Church for which
   He gave Himself. Should any fraudulent adversary dispute His claim, He
   shows His pierced hands and points to His wounded side. The emblems of
   His passion are the seals of His possession.

   They are also His by conquest. Old Jacob, when he lay dying, gave to
   Joseph one portion above his brothers, which he had taken out of the
   hand of the Amorite with his sword and with his bow. The Lord Jesus can
   truly say of His people that He has taken them out of the hand of the
   Amorite with His sword and with His bow. Your conquering hand, O Jesus,
   when nailed to the Cross, rent away Your children's' chains. You have
   trod our foes in Your anger and trampled them in Your hot displeasure.
   Behold their blood is sprinkled upon Your garments and You have stained
   all Your raiment.

   Upon your necks, O you tyrants of the Church, has the Anointed put His
   feet. He has dashed you in pieces with His own right hand! He has
   broken the ties of the young lions and delivered His Israel out of the
   jaw of the lion and the paw of the bear. He has obtained His saints as
   a portion which He divides with the great, and as a spoil which He has
   taken from the strong. We are Christ's this day by conquest in us. What
   a battle He had in us before we would be won! How long He laid siege to
   our hearts! How often He sent His terms of capitulation.

   But we rejected all overtures of submission. We barred our gates. We
   fenced our walls against Him. The Law, with its great battering ram,
   smote our gates till the posts rocked in their sockets, but we
   fortified our strongholds and fought stoutly against the Most High,
   vowing that we would not be subdued. But ah, do you not remember that
   glorious hour when He carried our hearts by storm, when He put His
   Cross against the wall and scaled our ramparts, planting on our
   strongholds the blood-red flag of His atoning mercy?

   O Brethren, we are, indeed, the conquered captives of His omnipotent
   love. Thus chosen, purchased and subdued, the rights of our Divine
   possessor are undeniable, and we, His people, are the regalia of His
   royalty, the gems of His crown, the sheep of His pasture, the children
   of His love, the darlings of His heart--if He could renounce all else
   which owns His sway, yet can He never give them up of whom it is
   written, "the Lord's portion is His people."

   2. In the second place, the text shows that the saints are the objects
   of the Lord's special care. "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro
   throughout the whole earth"--with what object?--"To show Himself strong
   in behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward Him." The wheels of
   Providence are full of eyes. But in what direction are they gazing?
   Why, that all things may "work together for good to them that love God,
   to them who are the called according to His purpose." God is
   omnipresent and omniscient--has an eye to all creatures and all things.

   He sees all immensity. He beholds all things at one gaze. Yet, "the
   eyes of the Lord," in a special sense, "are upon the righteous." And
   though His ears are open to all things, yet, in a peculiar manner, "His
   ears are open to their cry." It is true the Lord is the eternal Watcher
   of the universe and never sleeps. Yet, in a very distinct sense, He is
   the guardian of His Church. "I the Lord do keep it. I will water it
   every moment, lest any hurt it. I will keep it night and day." "Behold
   He that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep."

   He encompasses all things by the Word of His power and He upholds all
   things by His might. But His power, His presence and His protection,
   are more peculiarly with His Church, for He is to her "a wall of fire
   round about her and a glory in her midst." The Church, then, as God's
   portion, is His peculiar care. When she lay at first in her barrenness,
   as a corner of the vast howling wilderness, He took her under His care.
   He fenced and hedged her. He began to dig up by the roots her nettles,
   her thorns, her briers. He sent the spirit of burning into her, by
   which the weeds of evil were consumed. He plowed her deep with
   convictions. He harrowed her with the Law. He scattered into her the
   incorruptible seed of the Word of God, which lives and abides forever.

   When He saw her tender blades springing up, He watched over every one
   of them, sending the dewdrops, and the rain showers, and the sunbeams,
   and the wind, just when they were needed. And He continues still to
   watch, even when her harvest grows ripe and the blade has given place
   to the full corn in the ear. He will watch until He himself, descending
   from the Great White Throne, shall take the golden sickle and reap the
   sheaves and return to His eternal garner rejoicing, bringing His
   sheaves with Him.

   Dear Friends, it is sweet to reflect how careful God is of His Church.
   We are jealous of our eyes, but the Lord keeps His people as the apple
   of His eye. What a wonderful affection birds have for their young. They
   will sooner die than let their little ones be destroyed! But like as an
   eagle flutters over her nest, so does the Lord of Hosts defend
   Jerusalem. What love a true husband has for his spouse! How much rather
   would he suffer than that she should grieve! And just such love has God
   towards His Church. Oh, how He cares for her! How He provides for her
   as a king should provide for his own queen! How He watches all her
   footsteps, guards all her motions.

   He has her at all times beneath His eyes and protected by His hands.
   Hear how He tells of His care in providing for His Israel. "Now when I
   passed by you and looked upon you, behold, your time was the time of
   love. And I spread my skirt over you and covered your nakedness: yes, I
   swore unto you and entered into a Covenant with you, says the Lord God,
   and you became Mine. Then I washed you with water. Yes, I thoroughly
   washed away your blood from you and I anointed you with oil. I clothed
   you, also with broidered work and shod you with badger's skin.

   "And I girded you about with fine linen and I covered you with silk. I
   decked you also with ornaments and I put bracelets upon your hands and
   a chain on your neck. And I put a jewel on your forehead and earrings
   in your ears and a beautiful crown upon your head. Thus were you decked
   with gold and silver. And your raiment was of fine linen and silk and
   broidered work. You did eat fine flour and honey, and oil: and you were
   exceedingly beautiful."

   Never was there care so tender, so perpetual, so faithful, so
   affectionate, as the care of God over all His chosen ones, for indeed,
   it is no fiction and no metaphor--the Lord's portion really is His
   people. He covers us with His feathers and under His wings do we trust.
   His Truth is become our shield and buckler. The Lord is mighty in
   battle for His Church. He puts out His omnipotence when He first of all
   delivers her, and no less might does He show every day when He keeps
   her from falling. And He will present her at last spotless before His
   face. Never was castle upon a mountain summit, fortified by nature, so
   impregnable as is the Church of God--

   "Munitions of stupendous rock Her dwelling place shall be; There shall
   her sons without a shock The wreck of nature see."

   3. The text includes the idea that the Church is the object of the
   Lord's special joy, for a man's portion is that in which he takes
   delight. Brethren, how very strong the Scripture is as to the delight
   which God has in His saints. I am sure you and I cannot see anything in
   ourselves why the Lord should take pleasure in us. We cannot take
   delight in ourselves, for we often have to groan, being burdened,
   conscious of our sinfulness. I am afraid that God's people cannot take
   much delight in us, for they must perceive so much of our imperfections
   and our follies that they must rather lament our infirmities than
   admire our graces.

   Oh, who would not rejoice in this transcendent Truth of God, this
   glorious mystery? The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear Him, in
   them that hope in His mercy! I do not read anywhere that God delights
   in the cloud-capped mountains, or the sparkling stars--but I do read
   that He delights in the habitable parts of the earth and that His
   delights are with the sons of men. I do not find it written that even
   angels give His soul delight, nor does He say, concerning cherubim and
   seraphim, "I will be a father unto you and you shall be My sons and
   daughters." But He does say that to the poor fallen race of
   man--debased, depraved, dejected by their sin--but saved, exalted,
   glorified by His Grace!

   See what terms He uses. He calls them His dwelling place. "In Jewry is
   God known, His name is great in Israel, in Salem also is His tabernacle
   and His dwelling place in Zion." "For the Lord has chosen Zion. He has
   desired it for His habitation." Where is a man most at ease? Why at
   home--

   "Wherever we wander, there's no place like home." Beloved, the Church
   is God's home. And as at home a man unbends himself, takes his
   pleasure, manifests himself to his children as he does not unto
   strangers--so in the Church, the Lord unbends Himself, condescendingly
   manifesting Himself to them as He does not unto the world. O could you
   think of it, that the chosen of God are as dear to Him as your humble
   cottage is to you, as the rooftree of your ancestors and the place of
   your birth?

   We are expressly told that the Church is the Lord's rest. "This is My
   rest forever, here will I dwell for I have desired it." As if all the
   world beside were His workshop and His Church His rest. In the
   boundless universe He is busy marshalling the stars, riding upon the
   wings of the wind, making the clouds His chariot. But in His Church He
   is at rest, in Zion the Everlasting One spends His Sabbaths!

   Yet further, there is an unrivalled picture in the Word where the Lord
   is even represented as singing with joy over His people. Who could have
   conceived of the Eternal One as bursting forth into a song? Yet it is
   written, "He will rejoice over you with joy, He will rest in His love,
   He will joy over you with singing." As He looked upon the world, He
   spoke and said, "It is very good," but He did not sing. And as He views
   the works of Providence, I hear not that He sings. But when He gazes on
   you and on me, the purchase of Jesus' blood--His own chosen ones--the
   great heart of the Infinite restrains itself no longer but, wonder of
   wonders, and miracle of miracles, God, the Eternal One, sings out with
   the joy of His soul! Truly, "the Lord's portion is His people."

   Once more, remember that the Lord represents himself as married to His
   Church. What does He say to her? "You shall be called Hephzibah and
   your land Beulah: for the Lord delights in you and your land shall be
   married. As a young man marries a virgin, even so shall your God marry
   you. And as a bridegroom rejoices over a bride, even so shall your Lord
   rejoice over you." He puts the affection, you see, in the most
   brilliant light. It is not only the affection of the husband to the
   wife, but seeing that some men are changeable, and their love grows
   cold, the Lord selects that hour of first love when the bridegroom,
   fresh and newly married, rejoices over his bride. The joy and love of
   the young honeymoon of married life is but a faint picture of the
   complacency and delight God always has in His people.

   Dear Friends, this is a subject to be thought of rather than to be
   talked about, for I find thoughts in my heart this morning, rather than
   in my head, and I cannot get them out. But this I know, there cannot be
   a closer union between any two beings than there is between Christ and
   His people, for they are members of His body, of His flesh and of His
   bones. There cannot be a warmer love than this. A mother's love is
   nothing compared to it--yes, "she may forget her sucking child and
   cease to have compassion on the son of her womb. Yet will I never
   forget you, says the Lord that has mercy on you."

   The husband may repulse from his arms the chosen one whom once he loved
   so tenderly but, "He hates putting away." Whom once He has embraced He
   embraces forever. "I will betroth you unto Me forever; yes, I will
   betroth you unto Me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving
   kindness and in mercies. I will even betroth you unto Me in
   faithfulness."

   Oh that this love were shed abroad this morning in our poor frozen
   hearts! Oh that we felt God's delight in us! For if by faith we knew
   all this, and by sweet experience could attest it, surely we should be
   better prepared to join with Jeremiah in the second text and say, "The
   Lord is my portion, says my soul."

   4. Our text teaches us that God's people are His everlasting
   possession. You will say, "Why?" There is an allusion here to the
   division of the portions among the different tribes. That which was the
   portion of Asher never could be the portion of Zebulon and that which
   belonged to Simeon never could belong to Dan. For there was a Law made,
   that if any man should lose his inheritance by debt, or should be
   driven to the necessity of selling it, yet at the Year of Jubilee it
   always came back again to him, so that, you see, no Israelite ever lost
   his portion.

   Now, God maps out for Himself His people. He says, "These are My
   portion." And do you think, Brethren, God will lose His portion? No--if
   He should sell His portion into the hand of the enemy for a season, yet
   at the Year of Jubilee it would return to Him. Glory be to God, that
   Year of Jubilee is come! We were sold once. It did seem as if we were
   no more the people of God. But the high priest has died, the Year of
   Jubilee has been proclaimed, and now God's inheritance has come back to
   Him, and if it could be alienated again, He would recover it.

   If a man is a child of God and is suffered to fall, he shall certainly
   be brought back by bitter repentance before he dies, that his soul at
   the last may be saved, for God shall not lose His heritage. Have you
   not noticed, in reading Scripture, how the Israelites always clung
   tenaciously to their portion? When Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your
   vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near
   unto my house: and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it.
   Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money,"
   Naboth said to him, "The Lord forbid it me, that I should give the
   inheritance of my fathers unto you."

   And so, Brethren, God will never sell His children at any price. Nor if
   He could have better people instead, would He change them. They are His
   and they shall be His while time lasts. And when time ends and eternity
   rolls on, He never can, He never will, cast away His chosen people. Let
   us in this rejoice and be exceedingly glad. "The Lord's portion is His
   people."

   II. We turn to our second text--"THE LORD IS MY PORTION, SAYS MY SOUL."

   Dear Friends, this sentence implies that true Believers have the Lord
   as their sole portion. It is not, "The Lord is partly my portion," not
   "The Lord is in my portion." No, He Himself makes up the sum total of
   my soul's inheritance. The Lord Himself is my portion. Men of this
   world, we are told, have their portion in this life. In the field they
   have it in their abundant crops, and in the house they have it in
   comfort, in riches. Some of them have it in purple and fine linen,
   faring sumptuously every day.

   But how is it God gives them so good a portion here? You may have seen
   a farmer when he has his meal prepared for his swine, he passes two or
   three of his little children in the yard as he is going out at feeding
   time. Why does he not give some of the meal to his children? He scoops
   it out till he has filled the hog's trough full, and then the swine
   come and eat till they lie down, full to bursting, their eyes standing
   out with fatness. How is it he does not give some of it to his
   children?

   "Oh, no," says he, "This is not the children's meat," and as it is not
   meet to take the children's bread and give it unto dogs, so it would
   not be meet to take the swine's meat and give it unto children. When
   Martin Luther had a large sum of money sent to him, he gave it all away
   directly to the poor, for he said, "O Lord, You shall never put me off
   with my portion in this life." Now when God's children receive anything
   in the way of gifts from Providence, they thank God for it, and
   endeavor to use it for His honor and glory--but they still insist that
   it is not their portion.

   You know, when you go to a shop to buy goods, they give you the brown
   paper and the string in the bargain--so when we seek first the kingdom
   of God and His righteousness, all these things are added to us. For
   godliness has the promise of the life that is now, as well as of that
   which is to come. But we don't go to buy the brown paper and the
   string, they are not what we are looking after--so with the true
   Christian, his portion, that which he seeks after--is his God. This is
   his only portion, he seeks nothing besides.

   When Abraham had many children by his wife Keturah, you remember it is
   written he gave them their portions and sent them away. But he never
   did so with his Isaac. Lord, let me be Your Isaac! Give the world its
   portion. Give the emperor his crown. Give the rich man his money bags,
   send him away. But let me be a stranger with You as Isaac in his
   father's tent.

   The man who has such a portion as this, ought not to wish for anything
   beyond. What can be needed beyond this portion? We are walking in the
   sunlight today--a fine glorious summer's day--if anyone of you should
   be crying in your pew this morning, and I should ask, "What are you
   weeping for?" and you should reply, "I am weeping because I cannot see
   the stars," we should think you mad. For he that has the sunlight can
   do without the starlight--so with the Believer. Why should he be
   weeping because he has lost this or lost that?--

   "You at all times, will I bless;
   Having YOU, I all possess;
   How can I bereaved be,
   Since I cannot part with YOU?" St. Augustine was likely, very often, to
   pray, "Lord, give me Yourself." A less portion than this would be
   unsatisfactory. Not God's Grace merely, nor His love. All these come
   into the portion but, "the Lord is, my portion, says my soul." More
   than His attributes, more than His love, more than His Covenant, is
   Jehovah Himself the special portion and privi- lege of His own Beloved
   ones. "My Soul, wait you only upon God, for my expectation is from
   Him." As God is our only portion, so He is our own portion--"The Lord
   is my portion, says my soul." I hope He is your portion, dear Brethren.
   But whether He is or not does not concern me so much as whether He is
   mine.
   Come, Brethren, have you got a personal grip of this portion? Are you
   sure it is yours? Pray for sinners. Ask that God may bring them in, but
   see, first of all, to your own personal interest in these precious
   things. Let it go round these pews now. Can you say, "The Lord is MY
   portion?" Let it not be a general declaration but a particular
   affirmation-- "The Lord is MY portion." Yes, with streaming eyes and
   bursting heart, many a soul here that can now see Jesus hanging on the
   Cross taking away all its guilt, can say, though almost choked with
   tears, "Yes, blessed be His name, the Lord is my portion."

   Some of you are very poor. You have nothing in the world, but you can
   say, "The Lord is my portion." Like the old woman who, when she had
   nothing to eat but a dry crust of bread and only a cup of water to
   drink, broke the bread and said, "All this, and Jesus Christ, too!" We
   have heard of a great man who once took a poor Believer and said--"Look
   over there at those hills." "Yes, Sir." "Well, all that is mine. That
   farm yonder, and that one yonder, and beyond that river over there--it
   is all mine."

   "Ah," said the Believer--"look at yonder little cottage, that is where
   I live and even that is not mine, for I have to rent it. And yet I am
   richer than you. I can point up yonder and say--there lies my
   inheritance, in Heaven's unmeasured space. And you may look as far as
   ever you can, you cannot see the limit of my heritage, nor find out
   where it ends nor where it begins."

   Oh, what a blessing, Brethren, it is as if you and I can say, "He is my
   heritage!" Do not, I beseech you, be satisfied with generals--come to
   particulars. I know people think they are going to Heaven in the lump
   but they never will. Men go to Hell in bundles but they go to Heaven
   separately. "But we are a Christian nation." Nonsense about a Christian
   nation! We are as fairly an un-Christian nation as we are a Christian
   nation. "Oh but we were all made Christians when we were sprinkled."
   You are not such fools as to believe this abominable superstition. You
   know better! How can a drop of water on the forehead change the heart
   or affect the nature, or floods of water, for that matter? You know
   better than that.

   Have you been born again from above? If you have not, you are not the
   children of God, and you have not a child's portion. Have you passed
   from death unto life? If not, you have not the portion of the living in
   Zion. You may, perhaps, have had your portion as the prodigal son did,
   who said, "Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me." But
   unless you are converted, unless you have been brought to put your
   faith in Christ, you can never have that portion which belongs to the
   true-born heir of Heaven, for to him God has said--"Son, you are ever
   with Me and all that I have is yours."

   But again, the Lord is to His people an inherited portion. Many men
   have to thank God that their fathers were born before them, for they
   worked and made their money, and left their estates to them. It is not
   every man who is rich that owes his riches to his own industry, and
   certainly, if you and I are so rich as to have God for our inheritance,
   we owe it to the fact of our birth. How came I to be the child of God?
   I was born so--O no, you were born an heir of wrath. I know I was the
   first time but the second time I was born in the image of His Son,
   begotten again unto lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
   from the dead.

   You cannot earn this inheritance by working for it. You cannot purchase
   it. You can only gain it by inheriting it. Ask yourselves very solemnly
   whether you know anything of the new birth, and if you do not, as the
   Lord my God lives, and as your soul lives, you can have no lot or
   portion in this matter until you do. "If children, then heirs. Heirs of
   God and joint-heirs with Christ." But if not children, then not heirs
   and the heritage cannot be yours.

   But further, Brethren, this heritage is also ours by choice. We have
   chosen God to be our heritage. Believer, I ask you, supposing it could
   be left to you now whether you would have God to be your portion, or
   have the most splendid earthly destiny, which would you have? Oh, you
   would say, "Let me have my God." At first, I grant you, the will of man
   is not free to choose Christ, for man chooses evil and not good and the
   Lord must choose our inheritance for us, or else we shall never choose
   it. "You have not chosen Me but I have chosen you," was the word of
   Christ through the Apostle to all His people. But if we are really
   called according to the purpose of electing love we can sing--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again
   With love intense I burn; Chosen of Him before time began, I choose Him
   in return."

   Better to have Christ and a fiery stake, than to lose Him and wear a
   royal robe. Better Christ and the old Mamertine dungeon of the Apostle
   Paul, than to be without Christ and live in the palace of Caesar.
   Christ Jesus, You blessed portion of our souls! You are altogether
   lovely. And if we had to begin again, we would, by Your Grace, begin
   with You.

   Again, dear Friends, God is his people's settled portion. When you were
   married, some of you, there were marriage settlements to be made, deeds
   to be drawn up, and lawyers called in and witnesses to sign the
   marriage covenant. I suppose that when the Princess Alice gets her
   portion, it will be settled upon her in some way or other. For where
   there are great portions, there should be settlements. Blessed be the
   name of the Most High, there is a marriage settlement made upon all the
   Lord's people--their portion is settled on them.

   "Yes, and amen in Christ Jesus," all the promises have been made to the
   chosen seed. Heaven and earth may pass away but the Covenant of Grace
   shall not be removed. The covenant of day and night may be broken. The
   waters may again cover the earth, sooner than the decree of Divine
   Grace be frustrated. Every promise of the Covenant is a consequence to
   every heir of Heaven, nor can Satan break them. No Parliamentary act
   passed on earth, no deed perpetrated in the conclaves of Hell, can ever
   affect the eternal, immutable, everlasting settlements of Covenant
   Grace which are made in Christ Jesus, ordered in all things and sure.
   The Lord is my settled portion.

   The Lord is my all-sufficient portion. God fills himself. And as Manton
   says, in his exposition of the 119th Psalm, "If God is all-sufficient
   in Himself, He must be all-sufficient for us." And then he uses this
   figure--"That which fills an ocean will fill a bucket. That which will
   fill a gallon will fill a pint. Those revenues that will defray an
   emperor's expenses, are enough for a beggar or a poor man--so when the
   Lord Himself is satisfied with Himself, and it is His happiness to
   enjoy Himself, there needs no more--there is enough in God to satisfy."
   This is clear reasoning, Brethren, and surely if the expenses of
   Heaven's court never did affect God's riches, all the expenses of our
   trial and affliction while we are here, never can diminish the
   unsearchable riches of God which are in Christ Jesus our Lord.

   But you will tell me that man's wishes are very large and that it is
   hard to satisfy them. Ah, my Brethren, I know they are--with anything
   here below. You may have heard, I dare say, of the gentleman who told
   his servant, "You have been a very faithful servant to me, John, and as
   you are getting old, I should like to give you a pension. Now, what do
   you think would satisfy you?" "Well, master," said he, "I think if I
   had fifty pounds a year I should be very well satisfied, indeed."
   "Well, think it over," said the master, "and come to me and let me
   know."

   So the day comes. "Now, what do you want to satisfy you?" "Well, Sir,
   as I said before, I should never want for anything, or wish for
   anything in this world, if I had fifty pounds a year." "Well, John, it
   shall be done. There is the settlement for you--you shall have it."
   That man went out of the door and said to a friend, "I wish I had said
   a hundred." So, you see, it is not easy to satisfy man. When he thinks
   he is satisfied, he still sees something beyond, the horse leech in his
   heart still cries, "Give, give." But God is a satisfying portion. You
   cannot wish for anything more than this--

   "All my capacious powers can wish, In You is richly stored; Nor can my
   soul conceive a joy Which is not in my Lord."

   I think I may add--and the experience of every Believer will bear me
   out--we have today a portion in which we take intense delight. I have
   tried in a poor way to show that God had a delight in His people.
   Beloved, do not His people, when they are in a right state of heart,
   have an intense delight in Him? Friends, we have known what it is to
   have delight in our children, delight in our Church. We have had
   delight in this House of Prayer. We have delight in one another, in
   sweet companionship and communion. But if you have ever tasted delight
   in God, you will say with Rutherford, "I have eaten the bread of angels
   and my mouth is out of taste for the brown bread of this world."

   God gives us "a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
   fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined." "I will
   satiate the soul of My priests with fatness and My people shall be
   satisfied with My goodness, says the Lord." Oh the delights that we
   have in God! They are not ankle-deep delights, nor knee-deep delights.
   But they are a river to swim in. Here we can bathe our souls--here we
   riot and revel in inexhaustible luxuriance of delight. Here our spirit
   stretches her wings and mounts like an eagle. Here she expands herself
   and only wishes she were more capacious, and therefore she cries,
   "Lord, expand me, enlarge my heart, that I may hold more of You."

   Often have we felt in the spirit with Rutherford, when he cried, "Lord,
   make me a heart as large as Heaven, that I may hold You in it! But
   since the Heaven of heavens cannot contain You, Lord, make my soul as
   wide as seven heavens, that I may contain Your fullness." "O that the
   Lord would bless me, indeed, and enlarge my coasts."

   And lastly, this is to the saints of God an eternal portion. Ungodly
   Man, you have your portion now. It will melt, Sir! When the last fire
   comes, it will be consumed. But the lot of the Believers will outlast
   the fire. The conflagration which devours all the work of man's hands
   shall not be able to touch, nor even to scorch any part or parcel of
   the portion of Believers. Indeed, it is in the world to come that
   Believers shall have their portion. Here they have none except trials
   and troubles--"in the world you shall have tribulation." But as God
   cannot be seen and as He is the Believer's portion, so their portion
   cannot be seen.

   It is a good remark of an excellent commentator upon that passage, "For
   which cause He is not ashamed to be called their God." He writes to
   this effect, "If it were only for this world, God would be ashamed to
   be called His people's God, for His adversaries would say, 'Look at
   those people, how tried they are, what troubles they have, who is their
   God? And, says he, the Lord speaks as if He might be ashamed to be
   called their God, if this life were all. But the Scripture says, 'Why
   God is not ashamed to be called their God: for He has prepared for them
   a city.' "

   Thus may the Lord turn upon His enemies and Say, "I am their God and
   although I do chasten them sorely, and lead them through the deep
   waters, yet see what I am preparing for them--see them as they shall be
   when I shall wipe all tears from their eyes and shall lead them unto
   living fountains of waters." It is in the prospect of bliss so
   ecstatic, joy so boundless, glory so eternal, that He is not ashamed to
   be called their God.

   We are not ashamed, Brethren, to call Jehovah our God. Now let us go
   our way this morning to our homes. Let us eat the fat and drink the
   sweet in God. Let us put on our beauteous array and be appareled with
   the sun and have the moon under our feet. Let us go forth as princes of
   the blood-royal, and act according to our quality. Let us rejoice in
   the Lord always. Let us show to the world that we are a happy and a
   blessed people, until our adversaries shall have their mouths watering
   while they say, "Let us live the life and die the death of the
   righteous." "The lines have fallen to us in pleasant places and we have
   a goodly heritage."

   Dear Friends, I shall only ask in conclusion--are there not many here
   who cannot say, "You are my portion, O Lord"? Will you do me this favor
   this morning? When you get home will you think what your portion is,
   and cast your accounts up? If you cannot put God in the list, I tell
   you that when you have cast all your portion up, it comes to nothing.
   It may glitter for a season, but it shall go out like brambles that
   crackle under the pot but which die out afterwards in a little heap of
   white ashes. You have nothing if you have not God.

   Ask if it is worth while for the sake of this empty world to lose
   eternal things--and if you are convinced it is not, then may God lead
   you to put your trust in the Lord Jesus, and in the Lord Jesus only.
   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." Or, to give
   you the full, as Christ puts it, "He that believes and is baptized
   shall be saved." He that with his heart believes in Christ and with his
   mouth makes a profession of faith, (and it should be done in Baptism),
   shall be saved. God grant us His Grace to believe, then our portion is
   sure forever and ever, in this world and in the world to come.

                         The Lord'S Care Of His People

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, APRIL 27, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He that touches you, touches the apple of My eye." Zechariah 2:8.
   GOD'S love to His ancient people is the theme of many a Psalm and
   deserves to be rehearsed in the ears of every generation. Abraham was
   by nature as a rough unhewn stone, but the Lord who chose him in the
   quarry, having hewn him from the rock, made him a polished pillar, a
   monument of Divine faithfulness. The Lord set His love upon him while
   he was a Syrian ready to perish. He brought him out of the land of his
   nativity and called him from his father's house.
   Having made a Covenant with the solitary man, He multiplied his seed
   until they became as plentiful as the stars of Heaven. The kindness
   which God showed towards Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, He retained towards
   His chosen people, who sprang of their loins. Even when to all
   appearance He had deserted them, His face was towards them for good. If
   He sent a famine and broke the staff of life, He provided seven years
   of plenty in Egypt, that the storehouses of Pharaoh might be full for
   their sakes.
   If the Egyptians heavily oppressed them, then all the powers of nature
   were put out of their accustomed pathway to emancipate them from the
   house of bondage. When He had brought them out into the howling
   wilderness, His path dropped fatness, the heavens rained forth bread,
   and the rocks flowed with rivers. He made men to eat angels' food. He
   carried them as on eagles' wings. He could truly say, "I shod you with
   badgers' skin and I girded you about with fine linen."

   He made His Jeshurun to ride upon the high places of the earth and fed
   His Israel with royal dainties, "butter of kine and milk of sheep, with
   fat of lambs and rams of the breed of Bashan and goats, with the fat of
   kidneys of wheat." Wherever they went, their foes fled before
   them--Amalek was put to confusion before the people of the Lord. Sihon,
   king of the Amorites and Og, king of Bashan, felt the terror of their
   arm. Even the false prophet, as he looked from the mountain's brow upon
   them, could only say, "Happy are you, O Israel: who is like unto you, O
   people saved by the Lord, the shield of your help and who is the sword
   of your excellency? Your enemies shall be found liars unto you. And you
   shall tread upon their high places."

   In due time He brought this people into the best spot of land which the
   earth knew--a country which indolence and tyranny have rendered barren,
   but which anciently overflowed with superabundant fertility. He brought
   them to a land of hills and valleys, of springs and rivers--a land out
   of whose heart they might take iron and copper and treasures in
   abundance. He established them in a land which flowed with milk and
   honey, so fertile that even its spontaneous productions, as exampled in
   the grapes of Eshcol, rivaled the products of the choicest husbandry.

   Having brought them into this goodly heritage, He drove out the former
   inhabitants that He might plant His people and make them dwell in
   safety alone. How gracious He was to them in the days of Joshua and in
   the years which followed! When He mapped out their lots according to
   their tribes, He rejoiced to dwell in the midst of them. He had His
   tabernacle in Shiloh and His dwelling place in Zion. He showed not
   Himself unto other people but only unto this nation upon which His
   heart was set. He chastened them but He raised up judges for their
   deliverance.

   At last He gave them a king in His anger and took him away in His
   wrath. But He sent unto them David--a man after His own heart, before
   whom their enemies were rooted out and the nobles among their
   persecutors were made like Zebah and Zalmunna who fell by the hand of
   Gideon. Greatly He blessed the nation under David and his immediate
   successors! Everything in the neighboring countries was ordered only to
   bring peace and prosperity to the chosen land-- Your land, O God, which
   You have overshadowed with Your wings.

   Oftentimes they provoked Him but His anger waxed not hot against them.
   When He lifted up His rod, His strokes were few and He repented of the
   evil which He did unto them. At last, when they became incorrigible in
   their sins and made their brows like flint and their hearts like
   adamant, for a season He gave them up to captivity. They were taken to
   Assyria, they were carried away to the rivers of Babylon. The days of
   their banishment were many and they wept in the bitterness of their
   soul. Still, even in their captivity He loved them.

   When they had forgotten Him, He had not forgotten them and in due time
   He brought them up again out of the house of their bondage, once more
   to set them in their land. It was about this time when He would give to
   His people a fresh deliverance, as memorable as the coming out of
   Egypt, that Zechariah testified, "he that touches you, touches the
   apple of My eye." As much as to say, "I smite you, but I hate the
   nation that oppresses you. I take the axe to cut down your stubborn
   pride but lo, I will break the axe to shivers. I send against you the
   executioners of My anger but I will surely punish them, also, for the
   evil which they have done. He that touches you--even though I am the
   great first cause of the terrible onslaught upon you--'he that touches
   you, touches the apple of My eye,' and I will be avenged on him in the
   day of My wrath."

   Thus introduced, the text seems to teach us three lessons, upon which
   we shall speak briefly and God grant it may be to your edification. It
   tells us, first of all, God's esteem of His people. Secondly, danger
   much surrounds persecutors. And, thirdly, the safety of the Church of
   God. For it may be well to remind you that the Jewish nation was a type
   of the Church of Christ.

   I. First, then, our text teaches us GOD'S ESTEEM OF HIS PEOPLE. He
   esteems them as much as men value their eyesight and is as careful to
   protect them from injury, as men are to protect the apple of their eye.
   The pupil of the eye is the most tender part of the most tender organ
   and very fitly sets forth the inexpressible tenderness of God's love.
   As Calvin remarks, "There is nothing more delicate or more tender than
   the eye in the body of a man. For were one to bite my finger or prick
   my arm or my legs, or even severely to wound me, I should feel no such
   pain as by having the pupil of my eye injured."

   Behold, then, Beloved, a mystery of loving kindness and affection. The
   Lord sits upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants there are as
   grasshoppers, the nations are as a drop in a bucket and are counted as
   the small dust of the balance--how marvelous that He has thoughts of
   everlasting love towards such worthless things! As we said this
   morning, it is wonderful that God should even notice such insignificant
   creatures as men, that He, in His infiniteness should be able even to
   discover such delight in this drop of matter which we call the world.

   But that wonder is totally eclipsed by another, namely, that God should
   love such utterly worthless, as well as insignificant creatures. Oh,
   Great One, when You did give Your heart, were there not some creatures
   worthy of it? No! There could be none, for even Gabriel himself was not
   fit to match the eternal God. The cherubim and seraphim, the presence
   angels that stand before God as His holy servitors forever, what were
   they? They were not pure in His sight and He charged His angels with
   folly. The noble created intelligences are so far inferior to our God,
   that only by wondrous condescension could He love them.

   O God, how is it that You could have chosen the debased, depraved,
   rebellious, hard-hearted creature called man? Why did You look upon
   such an one and bring him into Your favor? What is man, that You are
   mindful of him, or the son of man that You visit him? This enquiry we
   cannot answer and therefore, no more curious to solve this mystery, we
   will weave it into our everlasting song, and we will sing of Your
   Sovereign Grace before Your throne forever. 'Twas of Your Divine Grace,
   of Your own will and good pleasure, that You have lifted us up from the
   dunghill and made us to sit among princes.

   It is not for us to know why the Lord has His people so highly in
   estimation, for we cannot search to the bottom of this Divine mystery.
   But, Brethren, God's love, which at first came to [See No. 447
   Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit] us freely, has so ennobled us in
   Christ, that God's present esteem of us in Jesus is not without reason
   and justification. Love without cause has now imparted and imputed such
   loveliness to its objects, that in Christ they are fitting subjects for
   love's embrace.

   Know you not that the saints are the masterpieces of His workmanship?
   God has shown His wisdom in balancing the clouds and guiding the stars
   in their orbits. Infinite wisdom is discoverable in every flower and in
   every living thing. But the wisdom and the skill of God are far more
   clearly to be seen in the Believer than in any other work of the Divine
   hand. Man, born the first time, was fearfully and wonderfully made, but
   newly-created and regenerated, he is far more full of marvels than he
   was before.

   Therefore, because of the Divine skill which has been shown in our
   re-creation, well may we be the objects of Divine care. When Bernard
   Palissy had, after long struggles, invented that valuable ware which
   still remains unmatched, we can suppose that, if a person had entered
   his room and broken those invaluable dishes, which were worth their
   weight in gold, he would have said, "I had sooner that you had burnt my
   house, or that you had maimed my person, than break these things which
   have cost me so much thought, so many trials in the furnace and so much
   daily watching and nightly care."

   When the poor man had pulled up the very floor of his room, to heat the
   furnace for the last time, before he saw the precious stuff come from
   the crucible, his work must have been dear to him. And when we think
   that God, our God, has made His people the objects of His eternal
   thoughts, the trophies of His noble skill, vessels of honor fit even
   for the Master's use, it is but little wonder that He should guard them
   with a jealous care, even as men do the apple of their eye.

   Moreover, all the people of God are the object of the dearest purchase
   that was ever known, since they were redeemed not with corruptible
   things, as with silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ.
   Stand at the foot of Calvary and let the groans of Christ pierce your
   heart. Behold His head crowned with thorns. Look at His hands and His
   feet streaming like fountains of blood. Think for a moment of the awful
   anguish which His spirit suffered, of the unknown pangs He bore when He
   redeemed our souls unto God. And you will readily conclude that love so
   amazing, which could pay a price so stupendous, would not easily loose
   its hold of that which it has thus purchased unto itself.

   We think little of ourselves, when we value ourselves at anything less
   than the price which Jesus paid. We dishonor the Lord which bought us,
   if we think ourselves only fit to live unto the flesh, and to this poor
   temporary world. When, indeed, we are fitted for a heavenly world and
   for most Divine purposes, seeing that Christ, the Son of the Highest,
   shed His very heart's blood to redeem us from our sins. Well, I say,
   may He value highly, those whom He has so dearly bought!

   Furthermore, let us remember that to God the Father, the saints are
   Christ's most tender memorial, monuments of Christ's passion and
   conflict, the engraved tablets of His death. What is there in Heaven
   which is the record of the Redeemer's achievement? Yonder spirits
   before the Truth of God are the monuments of the battle and the
   victory. What is there to bear witness on earth to what the Lord has
   accomplished? We who have by faith believed, are now the living
   triumphs of His conquest. If you and I had erected a lasting and
   valuable memorial to some beloved child, we should think it a grievous
   insult and a serious injury if an adversary should wantonly and
   wickedly defile it.

   And so the Lord looks upon His own people as standing mementoes and He
   counts it no small sin, no mean offense, for any of His adversaries, be
   they ever so great, to touch His anointed and do harm to His chosen. As
   obelisks, arches, columns and pillars are raised in commemoration of
   heroes and their glories, even so are the saints the sublime memorials
   of Jesus. Precious are they for this cause, to the heart of Him who
   delights in the honors of His only begotten Son. The hosts of Heaven
   shall jealously guard these living stones of memorial.

   Yet more--remember that Christ's people are God's own children and you
   know how even we, although we are evil, could not stand still to see
   our children ill-treated. I have heard a man say sometimes, "You may
   strike me and I will not return the blow. You may even spit in my face
   and I will put up with the insult. But if you touch my children my
   blood is in my face, I cannot endure it." Ask a woman what it is that
   brings her mettle up the most--is it not if she sees her little ones
   ill-treated, or hears a word of false accusation spoken concerning
   them?

   The God of Heaven and earth will not have the princes of the blood
   royal ill-used. They who are descended from His loins and are thus the
   nobles and the peers of the court of Heaven, are not to be trod under
   the foot of man. God will avenge their quarrel at last. Surely as the
   world shall look on Christ, whom they have pierced, and mourn, so shall
   they look on the injured and persecuted Church and mourn because they
   despised the excellent of the earth and threw God's jewels into the
   mire. They are His children, I say. And therefore He loves them.

   Look around even to the brute creatures. When we would describe the
   creature most terrible, we speak of the bear robbed of her whelps. If
   you would describe the strong lion when he lashes his sides with fury,
   is it not when his cubs have been taken away? Then he rushes to the
   attack, fearless of the spear, and of the hunter, meditating terribly
   how he may destroy the murderer of the young lion. So shall it be with
   the Lord God Omnipotent. His fury shall be kindled against the enemy
   and He shall tear him in pieces if he touches any of the house of
   Judah, or of the seed of the Son of David. The King who is in the midst
   of them is mighty and He is strong who is their deliverer.

   Yet, again, no doubt there is a special reason why God is thus jealous
   over His people, since he who touches them, does to a certain degree,
   touch the Person of Christ--the Father's First-Born. Are they not
   members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones? The cry of Christ
   from Heaven, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" clearly shows that
   Christ looks upon the persecution of humble men and women as an insult
   to Himself. Should any wound your hand and then say, "I have not
   injured you." You would reply, "But it is my hand and it is so much a
   part of myself that I cannot separate myself from the injury."

   So is it with Christ. The poorest, mean, most illiterate Christian, is
   in the close union with the glorious Head of the body and it will be at
   the foeman's eternal hazard if he touch him, since he is part of
   Christ's mystical body. If you hurt His people willfully, the Son of
   man will say, "Inasmuch as you did it unto one of the least of these,
   My Brethren, you have done it unto Me," and the recompense shall
   follow.

   Do you not know that the children of God have a relation towards God
   the Father, in respect of their being partakers of His character and
   dignity? The saints are God's ambassadors. Among all nations an insult
   offered to an ambassador is an offense which cannot be readily wiped
   out. God's ambassadors to the sons of men are His chosen people. They
   are Christ's representatives on earth, so far as they live up to their
   profession. They who are the people of God are the Christs of this
   generation--anointed of the Lord and sent forth to tell of His love.
   Their life, if it is as it should be, is the picture of virtue and an
   example to mankind.

   Now the world's hatred to these men is but a part of their hatred to
   the Most High. They see His image in His servants and wantonly insult
   it, or contemptuously disregard it. When men oppose the people of God,
   it is because of their holiness. If it could be clearly proved that the
   world's opposition to the Church was on account of the Church's
   inconsistency, then it might be pardonable, or even virtuous. But we
   believe the real reason of the world's enmity is the Church's holiness.
   Were she not God-like and Divine, she would not be attacked. If she
   were not clear as the sun, fair as the moon, she would not be terrible
   as an army with banners, nor would the foe go forth in battle to meet
   her.

   Well, then, because holiness is insulted in a persecuted saint, because
   righteousness is itself debased and defamed when the righteous man is
   slandered and dishonored--the battle is not ours but the Lord's--and He
   will surely deliver His chosen. Because God espouses the quarrel of the
   virtuous, and takes up the gauntlet for the weak who desire to serve
   Him, therefore be careful, you sons of Ham, you children of the
   persecutor, be careful, for when He fits His arrows to the bow and
   draws His sword out of the scabbard, it shall go ill with you, for He
   remembers His people and He will avenge His own elect.

   II. The second point is THE DANGER OF PERSECUTORS--"He that touches
   you, touches the apple of My eye." If a man should seek to thrust his
   finger into our eye with the purpose of destroying our sight, I think
   we should not deliberate long as to the way in which to treat him. We
   should take good care that at all risks to our antagonist we defended a
   thing so precious.

   Now, when any molest the people of God, they may be certain of this,
   that God will surely visit them. Therefore let persecutors take heed
   how they meddle with God's eyes. According to the learned Blayney, our
   text may be read, "Whosoever touches you, touches the apple of his own
   eye." In this sense we understand the passage as declaring that God
   shall cause the enemies of His Church to work their own ruin. They
   shall pull out their eyes by their own fingers.

   The visitation of God will surely blast and wither those persecutors
   who go on in sin. At times it curses in the form of temporal
   death--more often, however, in the form of spiritual hardness of heart.
   I am not one of those who look upon everything that happens in this
   world as being a judgment from God. If a boat goes down to the bottom
   of the sea on a Sunday, I do not look upon that as judgment on those
   who are in it, any more than if it had gone to the bottom on a Monday.
   And though many good people get frightened when they hear one affirm
   this doctrine, yet I cannot help their fear, but like my Master, I must
   tell them that they who perish so are not sinners above all the sinners
   that are in Jerusalem.

   I looked the other day at "Fox's Book of Martyrs," and I saw there an
   illustration of that deeply-rooted mistake of Christian people,
   concerning God's always punishing men's sins in this life. Fox draws a
   picture of a Popish priest who is insulting the faith, speaking lightly
   of the blood of Jesus and exalting the Virgin Mary and he drops down
   dead in the pulpit. Fox holds him up as a picture of a great sinner who
   dropped down dead for speaking lightly of Jesus, and the good man
   affirms the wicked priest's death to be a judgment from Heaven.

   Well, perhaps Fox is correct, but still I do not see the connection
   between his dropping down dead and the language he employed, for many a
   preacher who has been exalting Christ has fallen down dead in the
   pulpit. And happy was it for such a man that he was engaged in minding
   his charge at the time. The fact is, Providence smites good men and bad
   men, too. And when the storm rages, and the hurricane howls through the
   forest, not only are the brambles and briars shaken and uprooted, but
   goodly oaks crack and break, too. We are not to look for God's
   judgments, except in special cases, in this life. His judgment is in
   the world to come.

   Yet there have been some special cases. Look at Antiochus Epiphanes,
   one of the greatest persecutors that the Israel nation ever had--his
   death was so awful that I should disgust you if I described it.
   Remember, too, Herod the Great. "The disease of which Herod the Great
   died and the misery which he suffered under it, plainly showed that the
   hand of God was then in a signal manner upon him. For not long after
   the murders at Bethlehem, his distemper," as Josephus informs us,
   "daily increased in an unheard-of manner. He had a lingering and
   wasting fever and grievous ulcers in his entrails and heart, a violent
   colic and insatiable appetite.

   "He had a venomous swelling in his feet, convulsions in his nerves, a
   perpetual asthma and offensive breath. He acquired rottenness in his
   joints and other members, accompanied with prodigious itching, crawling
   worms and intolerable smell--so that he was a perfect hospital of
   incurable distempers." The Roman emperor, Julian, a determined enemy of
   Christianity, was mortally wounded in a war with the Persians. In this
   condition, we are told, he filled his hand with blood and casting it
   into the air, said, "O Galilean! You have conquered."

   History affords you many such cases. God has seemed to say to His
   Providence, as David said to Solomon concerning Joab, "Let not his hoar
   head go down to the grave in peace." I read the other day a list, I
   should think, of a hundred of the mighty persecutors--Roman and Grecian
   and so forth--all of whom came to a most shocking and untimely end. In
   the face of so many facts, one did feel it fair to draw the inference
   that, "Bloody and ungodly men shall not live out half their days."

   There is a story told of the days of the Cavaliers, when they used to
   hunt up the Puritans for meeting in the woods, in the fields, or on
   secluded banks, to worship God. One old man, who was parish constable,
   was asked to be an informer and hunt up a certain meeting in his parish
   in Northamptonshire but the old man said "No," he'd have nothing to do
   with it--not that he liked those people, for he hated them. "But," he
   said, "I should not advise any of you to meddle with any of these
   people. In the good old days, when Sir Harry was alive, he hunted them
   and took eight troopers with him to harass the Puritans all round this
   region.

   "And," he said, "the old man is dead, six of the soldiers are dead.
   Some of them were hanged and some of them broke their necks. And I
   myself fell off my horse and broke my collarbone in the act of
   persecuting them. For my part, I have had warnings enough, and I will
   never meddle with them again." And I have no doubt that history could
   tell hundreds of tales of that kind, where God has seemed, at last, to
   leave off His general rule of long-suffering and of patience and to
   give to His foes a blow then and there, for their hectoring and
   intolerable hunting of His children and harassing them out of the land.

   Far oftener, however, the penalty has come in spiritual things. He has
   left them to wax worse and worse, till they have become so hardened in
   sin that they "breathed out threats against the saints," and licked up
   the blood of God's children as dogs licked up the blood of Naboth. No
   sermon has had power to move them. No Truth of God could awaken Them.
   No warnings of Providence could alarm them. No wooing invitations could
   win their hearts. They have gone down, down, down a steep descent with
   their feet slipping in gore--in the red crimson mire, crimson with
   blood of saints--and in Hell they have lifted up their eyes in torment.

   "I'd like," said one old Romanist in the days of Luther, "I'd like to
   ride up to my horse's bridle in the blood of Lutherans." And he had his
   wish before long in another way, for in a dreadful bursting of
   blood-vessels in his own body, he laid weltering in his gore. Not up to
   his horse's bridle but covered to his very soul with a suffocation of
   blood. God has done this, spiritually, to other men. They wanted to
   slay other men's souls and the blood, as it were, of their own souls
   has drowned them. They would let off the light, and God has left them
   in darkness. They would throw away the salt and God has given them up
   to rot and to become putrid. They slew God's ambassadors and God has
   proclaimed eternal war against them--a war which rages now and will
   rage in the world to come.

   I do not know whether I happen to have any person here who might be
   called a persecutor. We do not have much persecution to suffer
   now-a-days--at least, it does not come to much. I know that many
   servants lose their places, many wives are ill-treated by their
   husbands--now and then some poor husbands by their wives. And I know
   that children have been made wretched by their parents. Ah, but when
   you put these things side by side with Smithfield and the old Lollard's
   Tower, they come to nothing.

   Yet I know that there are many men who only want power and they would
   be as violent against God's people as ever the tyrants were in the
   olden times. Very well, then, as you cannot do what you would do, since
   you do what you can, God shall visit that, also, upon your head and you
   shall find that the jest and the sneer and the jibe and the slander and
   the cruel mocking, shall by no means lack their reward.

   But I will not dwell upon a point which we care so little to mention.
   Let us turn, rather, to the last point, upon which I speak with
   brevity.

   III. THE SAFETY OF THE CHURCH. "The Church is in danger! The Church is
   in danger!" Do you believe that, dear Friends? No, it depends upon
   whose Church it is. But if it is God's Church, all the croakers in the
   world cannot alarm us, for we believe that God's Church is safe enough,
   despite everything that may be said. "Oh but the Church is in danger
   from Romanism!" Nonsense! God can keep that in bounds. The dragon would
   have drowned the woman with the floods of his mouth centuries ago, if
   the Lord had not secured her from harm forever.

   The gates of Hell shall not prevail against the Church, much less,
   then, shall the hates of Rome prevail. It is not the Church of our Lord
   Jesus Christ that is in danger. Perhaps the fat benefices may be. I
   will not say anything about that. I do not know of any particular
   promise upon which unscriptural officers and worldly dignitaries can
   rely, but the Church of God has special security guaranteed by
   Covenant, by promise and by oath. God is her pledged Preserver, for
   there is a promise--"I the Lord do keep her. I will water her every
   moment: lest any hurt her, I will keep her, night and day."

   The Church is not in danger, and why? Well, first, the very frame of
   nature was made to protect her. We take up a chestnut or other seed and
   we find outside a prickly envelope--then there comes a hard shell, then
   inside a soft one, and then a film, and then another film and at last,
   somewhere in the center, you get the life-germ. And all the rest was
   made to exist for a time and to rot and to decay, in order to preserve
   the life-germ from hurt and to furnish food for it when it began to
   spring up.

   Now, I look upon this great vaulted roof of Heaven and the whole earth
   as being but the surrounding envelope in which God has wrapped up the
   living seed of His Church. You will have to break the whole
   constitution of earth before you will be able to surprise with
   destruction those whom God has surrounded by munitions of such
   stupendous strength. Speaking after a mystical sort, the mountains are
   round about Jerusalem. The solid rocks of the earth are like arms
   beneath her. The very stars are her watchers and the firmament and the
   Heaven of heavens are the gates that shut out her raging foes.

   When the Lord made the heavens and the earth, what was the drift of the
   whole thing? For what was the earth preparing in the old geological
   past? Preparing, you tell me, for man. But why, and why was man made?
   God made the whole race of man, but in respect of that chosen life
   within the race, those elect men and women who are as the substance
   which is in the oak when it loses its leaves, the holy seed which is
   the substance of the race and of all time.

   And when man came into the earth and did multiply and God divided the
   nations and scattered them to the north and to the south, to the east
   and to the west, He divided the whole, looking to His people. He saw at
   one glance how it would be best for this empire to stand, or that
   monarchy to fall--how it would be more advantageous for that dynasty to
   exist through a whole stream of kings, or for that monarch to be cut
   off in his prime, before his son should be born who should take the
   scepter from the dying hand.

   I say that the whole machinery of nature, the whole work of God which
   He has made, is intended to be the shell in which the Lord preserves
   His people, and there must come, indeed--"The wreck of matter and the
   crash of worlds," and a total unloosing of the pillars of earth and
   Heaven, before you can perish, O you Children of God!

   But again, not only does nature, but Providence, too, works for the
   protection of God's people. "All things work together for good to them
   that love God." Stupendous agencies are abroad. The wheels are so high
   that they are dreadful, but the wheels are full of eyes, and they only
   turn in such a way as shall preserve the Church of the living God. When
   we shall see the end from the beginning, we shall be amazed as to how
   it was that everything turned upon the axle of the

   Church--how the greatest wheel turned on its pole to bring out the
   elect, to fetch up out of their spiritual darkness the generation who
   were afterwards to be enlightened--how the biggest wave that followed
   the keel of the Church's ship was ordained to wash it onward.

   And how the very wave which seemed to roll the other way, did but in
   some mystic manner still waft her onward to her desired haven. How
   storms and tempests, plagues and conflagrations, wars and bloodsheds,
   all co-worked to bring out the people of God, that the Lord's name
   might be glorified in them. Like some huge steam vessel, Providence
   bears on the Church and you must reverse those wheels which lash the
   sea of events to foam, before you can detain the Church from her haven.

   Yet further, not to detain you longer, the Church is constantly
   preserved, we know, by the ministry of angels. Unseen by us, the angels
   of God keep watch and ward around us. They bear up the Church's foot
   lest she dash it against a stone. They cover her head in the day of
   battle lest the fiery shafts should penetrate her helmet. By night and
   by day the watchers of God keep constant guard over the blood-royal of
   Heaven. Let us not be deceived in this matter, thinking that we have to
   deal here with a fancy or a myth.

   Angels have more to do with this world than we dream. They are more
   potent influences for the saints' good than ever we have known, for
   they are the ten thousand chariots of God, the ten thousand times ten
   thousand saints of the Most High who stand in their battle array this
   day. If your eyes are opened, you will be able to say with the
   Prophet-- "More are they that are with us than they that are with
   them." Reckon the angels as your friends--put them not down as though
   they were weak and feeble--believe them to be strong and then you shall
   not doubt but that the Church shall be preserved as the apple of God's
   eye.

   Then, last of all, God preserves His Church by the overruling of His
   Grace. By a sort of holy alchemy He fetches gold out of dross, medicine
   out of poison, success out of disaster. From seeming evil, He produces
   good, and better still, and better still, in infinite progression, so
   that the evil doings of the Church's enemies turn out for her good in
   the end and their worst projects are in the wisdom of God but designs
   for her advancement. Let us rest in this, then, quite confident that by
   all means and by any means the Church shall always be safe. She rocks
   today--a big wave seems to strain her tim-bers--but He who built her is
   on board. The eternal hand grasps the helm and the Mighty One, with
   unruffled brow, looks at the storm and bids the ship cut through the
   foam.

   She has not turned as yet, though rocks and quicksand threatened to be
   in her path. Straight as a line, "as an arrow from a bow drawn by an
   archer strong," she sped on her splendid flight, and on she shall go
   though a thousand hells boiled over to stay her Heaven-ordained
   mission. Yonder mighty billow, that seems ready to swallow her up and
   give her an eternal grave, shall break before her bow. And if she is
   for a moment buried in the spray, she shall either come up white from
   the washing, or she shall leap over it, ascending up to Heaven upon its
   crest.

   And if she goes down again, as though she would descend into the depths
   of the sea--the depths of defeat and dismay--it shall be but to bring
   up some sinner from the depth and save a soul that otherwise might have
   been lost. Oh, blessed be God, the Church is never insecure, no, nor
   yet one of her children--

   "Once in Christ, in Christ forever, Nothing from His love can sever. I
   know that safe with Him remains, Protected by His power, What I've
   committed to His hand, Till the decisive hour."

   The apple of God's eye shall not be touched. We shall never see a
   blinded deity, and until then we shall never hear that the people of
   God have perished and that the Church of Christ has been destroyed by
   her enemies. Courage, then, soldiers of Christ, courage! Turn not back
   through shame or fear. Another rush, another advance upon the foe, for
   you cannot be wounded, you are invulnerable. You cannot be defeated,
   you are invincible. God is in you and you must be almighty. He that
   touches you, touches the apple of His eye. Therefore dare, run risks,
   and venture for God, for you are always safe when you are venturing for
   Him.

   Our final question is, "Am I thus dear to God?" I would like you, now
   that I send you away, to ask yourselves that question. You, dear
   Friends up yonder, and you in this mighty tier, and you below, ask
   yourselves--"Am I thus dear to God?" Let each man and woman ask that
   question. How can I answer it? Is Christ dear to me? Then I am dear to
   God. Is

   Christ dear to me tonight? Do I rest on Him? If I do, I am saved. And
   if I do not, why should I not now? If I never have believed on Him, why
   should I not now?

   If I trust Him, He will save me. Lord, I trust You. Can you say that
   from your heart? Then the Spirit of God has helped you to say it and if
   tonight, poor Soul, whoever you may be, you will repose simply and
   wholly upon the merit of Jesus' blood and the power of His intercession
   in Heaven, you are saved. Go your way, your sins are forgiven. You are
   accepted in the Beloved, if you have trusted Christ. God help you to
   rely on Jesus now, and to His name be praise forever and ever! Amen.

                          Compassion For The Multitude

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JUNE 1, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And they say unto Him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes. He
   said, Bring them here to Me." Matthew 14:17,18.

   As was Christ, my Brethren, when in this world, so are we also. Such,
   indeed, is our calling of God. As Jesus was "the true light which
   lights every man that comes into the world," so He says to His
   disciples, "You are the light of the world." How memorable are those
   words of our Lord--"As You, Father, have sent Me into the world, even
   so have I also sent them into the world!" And how weighty are those
   expressions of the Apostle--"We pray you in Christ's place." "We then,
   as workers together with Him!"

   There is something more than an interesting parallel that I want you to
   observe. A rich allegory appears to be couched in the simple record of
   the Evangelists. The history of Christ is in type a history of His
   Church. A skillful reader would soon think this matter out. You will
   remember how Christ's Church was wrapped in swaddling bands at the
   first, how she was laid in the manger of obscurity, how her life was
   conspired against by heathen kings. You will remember her Baptism of
   the Holy Spirit, her trials and her temptations in the wilderness.

   The life of Christ afterwards will soon be thought out by you as
   shadowing forth a picture of the career of the Church. There is
   scarcely any point in the entire history of Jesus, from the manger at
   Bethlehem to the garden of Geth-semane, which is not, besides its
   personal narrative, a typical and pictorial history of His Church. Thus
   the Lord has been pleased to bequeath to His Church a great example
   written in His own holy life. As He raised the dead, so is she to do it
   through His Spirit that dwells in her. As He healed the sick, so is she
   to carry on a great healing ministry throughout the world.

   Or, to come to our text, as Christ fed the hungry, so the Church,
   wherever she meets with those who hunger and thirst after
   righteousness, is to bless them in the name of Him who has said, "They
   shall be filled." Your business as a Church today, and my business as a
   member of the Church of Christ, is to feed hungry souls who are
   perishing for lack of knowledge with the bread of life. The case before
   us we think will furnish a noble picture of our duty, of our mission,
   and of what we expect the Master to do for us that we may work mightily
   for Him.

   Let us endeavor first to glance at the whole scene, collecting into
   harmony the accounts given by the four Evangelists. And afterwards we
   shall proceed to consider two practical lessons to be deduced from it.
   This miracle is recorded by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. There is some
   little divergence in each, as there naturally would be, for no four
   spectators could give the same description of any one scene. But what
   one omits another supplies. A point that will be most interesting to
   one, had failed to strike another, while a third has been interested in
   something which the fourth had altogether omitted.

   It appears that Christ had sought out a waste region near the town of
   Bethsaida. Bethsaida was a place which He had frequently visited.
   Earnestly, on another occasion, did He warn Bethsaida and Chorazin,
   reminding them that their privileges would rise up in judgment against
   them to condemn them for their unbelief. He had sought out this waste
   place for the purpose of retirement, or for the sake of both Himself
   and His disciples, that they might rest from their weary toils.

   The people follow Him, they throng Him all day long. He preaches the
   Gospel to them, He heals their sick. And it was somewhere in the
   afternoon that the Master, ever patient and prescient of human wants,
   calls Philip to Himself. Now, Philip was of Bethsaida and Jesus said to
   Philip, "From where shall we buy bread that these may eat?" This He
   said to try Him to see whether his faith was proof against misgiving.
   Had Philip been a wise disciple he would have replied, "Master, You can
   feed them."

   But he was a weak follower of the mighty Lord. You know he afterwards
   proved his ignorance by saying, "Lord, show us the Father and it
   suffices." And he then received a mild rebuke--"Have I been so long a
   time with you and yet you have not known Me?" On this, Philip shows
   that he has not yet learned the lesson of faith. He cannot believe in
   anything he cannot see with the eyes of sense. Puzzled and amazed, he
   betakes himself to his fellow disciples to talk over the matter. Andrew
   suggests that there is a lad hard by that has five barley loaves and a
   few small fishes.

   Certainly, Andrew thinks, though they will not be enough, it is our
   duty to do our best. So the loaves and fishes are purchased out of the
   scanty store that Judas handed out, not perhaps without some grief to
   his heart, that he should have to look so much after other people. As
   the day wears on and the sun begins to set, the disciples come to the
   Master. Though the proposal had been suggested by Him, they seem to
   think He has forgotten it. So they come to Him and say, "Master, send
   the multitude away."

   They had thought over the problem of how to feed these people and had
   come to the conclusion that they could not do it. As they could not
   feed them, the next best thing would be to send them away to provide
   for themselves. Since they could not supply their necessities, they
   would endeavor to shut their eyes to their needs. "Master, send them
   away. Let them go and buy for themselves." The Master promptly replies,
   "They need not depart. There is no necessity for it--you give them to
   eat."

   Indeed, He spoke wisely. Why should hungry men depart from the house of
   Him who feeds all things, who opens His hands and satisfies the desire
   of every living thing? "You give them to eat," said He, that He might
   bring out from them a fair acknowledgment of their poverty. "Master,"
   they said, "we have here but five barley loaves and a few small fishes.
   What are they among so many?" Lifting up their eyes upon the vast
   assembled mass they roughly calculate that there must be five thousand
   men, beside a fair complement of women and of children.

   The Master bids them bring those loaves and fishes. He takes them, but
   before He breaks them, being a God of order, He bids the people sit
   down in companies. Mark, who is always such a keen observer, and
   paints, like Hogarth, all the little minutiae of the picture--says they
   sat down on the green grass, as if it were exceedingly abundant and
   verdant just there. Then he adds, they sat down by companies,
   afterwards using a word, which is translated "in ranks" in our version,
   but the Greek is such as you would use if you spoke of a long range of
   beds in a flower garden.

   They sat down in green beds, as it were, with walks in between them.
   Mark seems to have got the idea that they were like a number of flowers
   whom his Master went round to water. When they had all thus sat down,
   so that the strong might not struggle after the bread and tread it
   under foot, and that the weak might not be neglected--all placed in
   their rows--then the Master lifted up His eyes before them all, asked a
   blessing, broke the bread and gave it to the disciples and also the
   fishes.

   The disciples went round and distributed to each man, to each woman and
   child--and they did eat. They had been fasting all day long, so I dare
   say we should not be far wrong if, following the example of a
   countryman whom I once heard, we laid a marked emphasis on the word
   "did"--"they did eat!" They ate till their hunger was appeased. They
   ate till they were filled. They ate till they were abundantly
   satisfied. Then, I could suppose, on the table, or on a spot of the
   green grass, where Christ had laid out the first bread and fishes, the
   fragments that lay there had, in the meantime, multiplied.

   One does not like the idea of the disciples going round to gather up
   the odds and ends and crumbs that had fallen from each man--one would
   hardly think it would have been seemly. But here was bread that was not
   injured, that had not fallen in the dust or the mire--fragments--and
   they gathered up more than they had at first. Here, too, we have a
   wonder. Things had been multiplied by division and had been added to by
   subtraction. More was left than there had been at the first! No doubt
   that was done to disarm doubt and to defeat skepticism.

   In after days, some of those men might say, "True, we did eat and were
   satisfied, or it seemed as if we did, but it might have been in a kind
   of dream." That bread which was left, the twelve baskets full,
   furnished something solid for them to look at, so that they might not
   think it an illusion. They gathered up the twelve baskets full. This
   seems to be the crowning part of the miracle.

   Our Lord Himself, in referring to the miracle in after days, constantly
   says, "When we fed five thousand with five barley loaves, how many
   baskets had you? And when we fed four thousand, how many baskets full
   did you take up?" As if the taking up of the full baskets at the end
   was the clenching of the nail to drive home the blessed argument that
   Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God who gave His people bread to eat,
   even as Moses fed the Israelites with manna in the wilderness.

   Having thus considered the facts, we shall take them as a basis upon
   which to build, God helping us, two practical lessons. The text and the
   miracle itself teach us, first, our mission and our weakness. Secondly,
   our line of duty and Christ's strength.

   I. We are clearly taught here OUR MISSION AND OUR WEAKNESS. Our
   mission! Behold before you, disciples of Christ, this very day,
   thousands of men and women and children, who are hungering for the
   bread of life. They hunger till they faint. They spend their money for
   that which is not bread, and their labor for that which satisfies not.
   They fall down famished in your highways, perishing for lack of
   knowledge. Still worse, when they faint, there are some who pretend to
   feed them.

   Superstition goes about, and offers them stones instead of bread and
   serpents instead of fish. The Papist and the ceremonialist offer to
   sell these hungry souls something to gratify them. They try to feed,
   but it will not satisfy. They do but eat the wind and swallow the
   whirlwind. The infidel tries to persuade them that they are not hungry,
   they are only a little nervous. Thus he mocks their appetite. As soon
   will the body be satisfied with bubbles, or the mouth be filled with
   shadows, as the soul is satisfied with delusions and inventions of man.
   They faint. They famish. They are ready to die.

   Those who pretend to supply them do but mock and tantalize their needs.
   Nor can they feed themselves. Their wallets are empty. When Adam fell,
   he beggared all his posterity--neither man, nor woman, nor child among
   them is able to satisfy his or her own hunger. The ten thousands of
   your race in this land--in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, in America and
   Australia--not one among them, should they all subscribe together,
   could find so much as one loaf upon which a single soul might feed.

   Barrenness, leanness and sterility have seized upon all the fields of
   man's tillage. They yield him nothing. He sows, but he reaps not. He
   plows but obtains no harvest. By the works of the flesh no man living
   can be justified, and in the devices of human tradition or human
   reason, no souls can possibly find substantial comfort. See, disciples
   of Christ, see the great need which is before your eyes. Open the eyes
   of your understanding. Let your heart move, let your hearts beat with
   sympathy. Let your souls be alive to pity--do feel for those millions!
   I beseech you, if you cannot help them, weep over them. Let there be
   now before your mind's eye a clear and distinct recognition of the many
   hundreds and thousands who are crying to you, "Feed us, for we famish!
   Give us bread to eat, or we die!"

   I think I hear you reason in your hearts and whisper one to another,
   "Who are we that we should feed this multitude? Look at their hosts,
   who can count them? As the stars of Heaven for multitude, so are the
   seed of Adam. These hungry, craving mouths are almost as numerous as
   the sands on the sea shore. Why should we feed them?" Even so,
   remember, this is your mission. Neither should any of you take up and
   adopt a weakness of faith that was illustrated by Philip's questioning.
   If ever the world is to be led, it is with Christ through the Church.

   Until the kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of
   His Christ, we are the warriors who must carry the victorious arms of
   the Cross to the uttermost parts of the earth. We are the almoners of
   God's free bounty, until the fullness of the Gentiles is gathered in.
   God commands all men everywhere to repent. And we are to utter His
   mandate. Oh, my Brethren, you know how Jesus worked the work of His
   Father. You know how He went about doing good. But do you know how He
   said, "Greater works than these shall you do, because I go unto My
   Father"?

   Let the words sink down into your ears. Let the vision rise perpetually
   before your eyes. See your work. Great as it is, dispirited as you may
   be by the great multitude who crave your help--yet recognize the appeal
   to your faith. Let the magnitude of the mission drive you more
   earnestly to the work instead of deterring you from it.

   Do I hear you murmur, "The multitudes are great and scant the supply.
   We have but five loaves and they are made of barley. We have but two
   fishes and they are little ones. The bread hardly suffices for
   ourselves. The fishes are so small that they will be more bones than
   meat. What are these among so many?" "Do I hear you tell us, Sir, that
   we as a Church are to feed the world--how can we? How few are our
   talents! We are not rich in substance, we have no wealth with which to
   supply our missionaries, that we may send them out by hosts to lift up
   the banner of Christ. We have little talent--there are not many among
   us who are learned or wise--we have not much eloquence. We feel, though
   we do not feel enough--

   'Gladly my pity would reclaim, And snatch the firebrand from the flame.
   But feeble my compassion pro ves, And so must weep where most it
   loves.'

   "Besides," some of you add, "what can I do individually? Of what use
   can I be? And what can the few friends who are in earnest do? Why, the
   world will laugh at such a feeble body of men. They will say, 'What are
   these feeble Jews doing?' We have a mountain before us and we have to
   level it to a plain--how can we do it? Our strength is not
   sufficient--we are destitute of power. Oh, had we the great and noble
   on our side! Had we kings to be the nursing fathers, and queens the
   nursing mothers of our Church! Had we the rich to give their lavish
   treasure and the learned to give their wit and the eloquent to give
   their golden speech--then we might succeed!

   "But alas! Alas! Silver and gold we have none. And at the Master's feet
   we can lay but little--so little that it is utterly insignificant when
   compared with the world's pining wants, the whole creation's piteous
   laboring groans." Then I think I hear you heave a sigh and say again,
   "There is no more that we know of, no more bread that is procurable. We
   cannot buy for all this multitude." Brothers and Sisters if we have
   little gifts ourselves, we cannot buy the eloquence of others. Indeed,
   it were no use if it were bought. For oratory purchased is of no use to
   any cause. We need for Christ's cause the free utterance of willing men
   who "speak through their throats," and feel from their hearts what they
   propound with their lips.

   Such speak because they cannot help speaking. "Woe is me if I preach
   not the Gospel." If we have little ability of our own, we cannot buy
   more of others. The offices of love can never be assigned to the
   hireling. But I think I hear your disheartened spirits crying, "If we
   could add mercenary troops to the hosts of God, we might succeed--if we
   could procure by our donations more help, more strength for the Lord
   God of Hosts, then might there be bread in His house and then might the
   multitudes be fed."

   But two hundred pennyworth would not suffice for the five thousand. And
   millions would not suffice for the thousand millions of poor benighted
   men and women. Master, what can we do? There are so many--we have not
   the bread ourselves, and we cannot buy it on their behalf.

   And then I hear the groan of one who is growing gray in years, "Oh, I
   feel it, but it is getting late with me and the world's necessities are
   getting stern. The hunger has continued until men are famished. They
   have been without bread till they are ready to perish and faint by the
   way. The night comes on, a long and dreary night--who shall work, then?
   We are ready to go down into our graves. Our shadows are lengthened and
   our frame is shrunken. We are weak and hang our heads like bulrushes,
   as men who seek the grave that has long been seeking them."

   Let me tell you, My Brethren and fathers, we who are in our opening
   youth, we feel that, too. Good God! Our days spin round us now and our
   weeks seem to be hissing through the air, leaving a track like that of
   a burning brand. Work as we may, and some of us can say that we lose no
   time in Christ's cause, yet we can do nothing. We seem to be like one
   man alone against an innumerable host, or like a child seeking to
   remove a mountain with its own puny hands.

   Night is getting spent, we are growing sear, our years are flying by,
   our deaths are coming on. Souls are dying-- Hell is filling. All down
   the cataract of destruction men are being plunged incessantly beyond
   our sight, beyond our hope. We cannot do it. The more we feel our
   responsibility, the more our infirmity oppresses us. My Lord, You have
   called us to a work that is too hard! We cannot do it, Master. We come
   to Your feet and we say we cannot give food to these multitudes to eat.
   Mock us not. Command us not to impossibilities.

   You have bid us preach the Gospel to every creature under Heaven. We
   cannot reach them. We are too few. We are too feeble. We are too weak.
   We are too devoid of talent. Master, we cannot do it! At Your feet we
   are ready to fall in sheer despair. But hark! I hear the cries of the
   multitude as they come up in our ears. They say to us, "We are
   perishing-- will you let us perish? We are famishing--will you let us
   famish? Our fathers have gone down to Hell and our fathers' fathers
   have perished for lack of the bread that came down from Heaven and will
   you let us die?"

   Across from Africa the multitudes look over the sea to us and they
   beckon with their fingers--"Will you let us perish? Shall we forever be
   hunting ground for those who delight in chains and bloodshed?" From
   Asia they lift up the cry--"Will you always leave us? Shall we always
   be the bond slaves of Juggernaut, Brahma, Servia and Vishnu?" From
   Australia they cry to us, such as have not already perished. The
   Aborigines cry, "Shall we never see the light of the Gospel? Shall we
   never hear the Gospel?" And worse than the Aborigines, the wail of not
   a few who remember in dreams the services of our sanctuaries, but have
   forgotten in their labors the observance of our Sabbaths, their cry is
   piercing, indeed.

   Oh, how terrible is the wail--the combined wail that comes up from all
   the nations under Heaven! One man in Paul's dream, who said, "Come over
   and help us!" was enough to oblige him to action. And here are millions
   not in a dream but in open vision, who all at once say, "Come and help
   us." Did we say, just now, we could not? Surely we must recant our
   words and say, "We must." Good Master, we must! If we cannot, we must.
   We feel our weakness, but there is an impulse within us that says we
   must do it and we cannot stop, we dare not--we were accursed if we did.

   The blasts of Hell and the wrath of Heaven would fall upon us if we
   renounced the task. The world's only hope-- shall we put that out? The
   lone star that gilds the darkness--shall we quench that? The saviors of
   men, and shall we fold our arms and let them die? No! By the love we
   bear for Your name--by the bonds that unite us to You--by everything
   that is holy before God and humane in the sight of our fellow
   mortals--by everything that is tender and gentle in the throbbing of
   our hearts, and the yearning of our hearts--we say we must, though we
   feel we cannot!

   Yet there is a strong tendency in our hearts to shift personal
   responsibility. "Let us send them away into the villages to buy meat."
   We look towards some Bethsaida in the distance and say, "Let them go
   there and get food." This is a strong temptation with many Churches.
   Perhaps, you say, "We have not got all this work to do ourselves--there
   are other Churches. Let them do their part. In all the suburbs of
   London there are Chapels. There is the parish Church-- cannot they hear
   the Gospel there? There is the City Missionary going about after them.
   What need is there that we should visit them? No doubt there are some
   good men preaching in the street. Why should I do it? Let them go into
   the villages and get meat."

   Ah, but not so--the Master said to you, "You give them to eat." "YOU."
   Let this Church feel that it should look upon the world as if it were
   the only Church and do its utmost as if it had no helper under Heaven
   but had all the work to do itself. And let the entire body of the
   Church of our Lord Jesus Christ--instead of looking to societies for
   evangelization, or to commerce, or to governments--remember that she is
   the sole savior of the world. Christ never was incarnate in kings and
   in princes. His incarnation today is in the sacramental host of His
   elect.

   If you ask me where is God on earth, I point to the man Christ Jesus.
   If you ask me where is Christ on earth, I point you to His faithful
   Church, called by His Spirit. As Christ was the world's hope, so is the
   Church the world's hope--and she must take up the charge as if there
   were not another. Instead of sending some to this town and some to
   that, she must hear her Master say, "You give them to eat." I do fear,
   dear Friends, that we are, many of us, getting into a very easy state
   about perishing men, because we keep out of their way. To stop your
   ears to the cries of the hungry, or shut your eyes to the wants of the
   widow and the fatherless, is not the way to relieve famine.

   Nor is it the way of doing good in the world, to avoid the haunts of
   the poor and to leave the dens of desolation and sin. It is ours to
   touch the leper with our healing finger, not to shrink from his
   presence. It is ours to go and find out the stripped, and wounded, and
   helpless of the sons of men, and then to pour in the oil and the wine.
   Leave the priest and the Levite, if they will, to pass by on the other
   side. Your Master asks of you, Christian, practical, personal service.
   And your Christianity is worth nothing unless it makes you heed His
   word--"You give them to eat"--unless it makes you, as individual
   members, and as an united body, do God's work for the world's sake and
   for Jesus Christ's sake.

   I will tell you, the people of my charge, that the world's salvation is
   given instrumentally into your hands. As far as your power lies, you
   are to consider yourselves as the world's hope, and you are to act as
   such. And what shall I say of you if, instead of accepting this charge
   from Christ, you shall sit still and do nothing? If, after having built
   this great house in which you meet, you should disregard others who
   hear not the Word of Christ--if, being fed with Heaven's food
   yourselves, you shall be satisfied to let others perish--I tell you
   that, as a Church, Ichabod shall be written upon your brow!

   The garments of this Church shall be rent and her veil shall be torn
   away from her. She shall be set as a hissing. She shall be made a
   pillar of salt, like Lot's wife throughout all generations, if she
   dares to look back, now that the Master has called her to a great and
   solemn work. He that puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not
   worthy of the kingdom. I have faith in you, dear Friends, but I have
   more faith in my God. I have faith in you that you will not turn back
   but accept the awful charge which devolves upon you of giving light to
   the world. But if you reject it, I will be a swift witness against you
   at the Last Great Day--that you knew your Master's will and that you
   did it not--that you were called to the Master's service and you slunk
   back again to indolence and sloth.

   II. Having thus dwelt upon our mission and enlarged upon our weakness,
   it is time to turn the topic and come TO OUR LINE OF DUTY AND THE
   MASTER'S STRENGTH. Our line of duty begins, first of all, in immediate
   obedience to Christ's first command--"Bring them to Me." "Five loaves,
   Master, it is all we have; two fishes." "Bring them to Me." In Mark,
   the words are used--"Go and see." They were to look in their wallets
   and be quite sure that they had not any more. They were to rummage
   among all their treasures and bring every crust, every piece of flesh,
   or bread, to Christ.

   "Bring them to Me." "Master, they are barley loaves; only five." "Bring
   them to me." "There are two fishes. They are only two. They are not
   worth thinking of. Let us keep them for ourselves." "No, bring them to
   Me." "But they are such little fishes." "Bring them to Me," He says,
   "bring them to Me." The Church's first duty is, when she looks to her
   resources and feels them to be utterly insufficient for her work, still
   to bring all that she has to Christ.

   But how shall she bring them? Why, in many ways. She must bring them to
   Christ in consecration. There is a Brother, yonder, who says, "Well, I
   have but little money to spare!" "Never mind," says Christ, "let what
   you have be brought to Me." "Ah," says another, "I have very little
   time that I can spare in laboring to do good. "Bring it to Me." "Ah,"
   says another, "but I have little ability; my stock of knowledge is very
   slender; my speech is contemptible." "Bring it to Me." "Oh," says one,
   "I could only teach in the Sunday school." "Bring it to Me." "Ah," says
   another, "and I do not know that I could do that. I could but
   distribute a tract." "Bring it to Me."

   Every talent that the Church has is to be brought to Christ and
   consecrated. And mark this--I speak a strong thing which some will not
   be able to receive--anything which you have in this world, which you do
   not consecrate to Christ's cause, you do rob the Lord of. Every true
   Christian, when he gave himself to Christ, gave everything he had.
   Nothing he has is his own--it is all the Master's. We are not true to
   the Master's cause unless it is so. "What? not provide for our
   families?" Yes, verily, but that is given to God. "Not provide for
   ourselves?" Yes, verily, so long as you are not covetous.

   Remember, it is your Master's business to provide for you. If He
   provides for you through your own exertions, you are doing your
   Master's work and receiving of His bounty, for it is His work to
   provide for you. But still there must always be a thorough consecration
   of everything you have to Christ. Where your consecration ends, your
   honesty with God ends. How often you have made the vow in your hymn!
   And will you not be true to your covenant with Him?--

   "All that I am and all I have, Shall be forever Yours. Whatever my duty
   bills me give, My cheerful hands resign. And if I might make some
   reserve, And duty did not call, I love my God with zeal so great, That
   I would give Him all."

   "Bring them to Me"--not only in consecration but also in prayer. I
   think our Prayer Meetings should be the seasons when the Church brings
   up all her barley loaves and fishes to Christ. To get them blessed,
   here we come together, great Master, around the altar. We are weak and
   feeble, we come to be made strong. We have no power of ourselves, we
   come that we may receive power from on high. And we wait in the Prayer
   Meeting, as Your disciples did in the upper room at Jerusalem, till the
   Spirit is poured out.

   It is marvelous how a man with one talent can sometimes do ten times
   more than a man with ten talents, for he has ten times the Grace. A
   soldier, after all, is not always useful according to his weapon. Give
   a fool an Armstrong gun and perhaps he will destroy himself with it.
   Give a wise man but the poorest piece of firearm and you shall find,
   with good and steady aim, and bold advance, he shall do more service
   with his small weapon, than the other with far better arms.

   So there are men who seem as if they might be leaders in God's house,
   that are laggards, doing nothing--while there are others who are but
   little in Israel, whom God, through His Grace, makes to be mighty.
   Bring here, O you servants of the Lord, all that you have kept back,
   pour all the tithes into His storehouse, that His House may be full.
   Prove Me now, says the Lord of Hosts, if I do not open the windows of
   Heaven and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough
   to receive it.

   Let us bring all we have to Christ, likewise in faith, laying it all at
   His feet, believing that His great power can make little means suffice
   for mighty ends. "Lord, there are only five loaves"--they were five
   loaves only when we had them in our hands. But now they are in Your
   hands, they are food for five thousand men. "Lord, there are two
   fishes"--they were paltry to insignificance while they were ours, but
   Your touch has ennobled them and those little fishes shall become food
   for that vast multitude. Blessed is that man who, feeling that he has
   truly consecrated all to God, can say, "There is enough. I do not want
   more talent. I do not need more substance. I would not wish to have
   more. There is enough for my work. I know it is utterly insufficient in
   itself, but our sufficiency is of God."

   Oh, do not tell me, Sirs, that we, as a denomination, are too feeble to
   do much good! Do not tell me that the Christianity of England is too
   weak for the evangelization of the whole world. No such thing--there is
   enough, there is plenty, if the Master pleases. If there were only six
   good men living and these six were thoroughly consecrated to God, they
   would be enough for the world's conversion. It is not the
   multiplication of your means. It is not the complication of your
   machinery. It is not the organization of your societies. It is not the
   qualification of your secretaries for which God cares a whit--it is
   your consecrated men who are wholly His and only His.

   Let them believe that He can make them mighty and they shall be mighty
   through God to the pulling down of strongholds. I hesitate not to say
   that there are some pulpits that would be better empty than occupied.
   There are some congregations to whom it would be far better if they had
   no preacher at all--for, having a minister who is not ordained of God,
   and not speaking by faith--they content themselves with things as they
   are and grow listless. Were the sham taken away, they might cry out for
   a real ministry. God would bestow on them one taught of the Holy
   Spirit, who would speak with a tongue of fire, with inward witness and
   with spiritual energy, resting his confidence in God's promises and

   His Word.

   Oh, dear Friends, we ought to believe that there is enough means if
   Christ does but bless them, enough to bring in God's chosen ones.
   "Bring them to Me," once more, in active service. That which is
   dedicated to Christ in solemn covenant and in earnest prayer and in
   humble faith, must be dedicated in active service. Are you all at work
   for Christ? Members of this Church, I speak to you first--it is but
   incidentally that I address other Believers here. Are you all doing
   something for Christ? I think there should not be a single member of
   this Church who is not somehow occupied for the Master.

   Shall I except any? Except the weak upon their beds--but they can speak
   a good word for Him when they are visited! Except the dying upon their
   couches--but they can bear a blessed testimony to His faithfulness when
   they are going through the river! Except the dumb--but they can act
   religion, when they cannot speak it! Except the blind--but they can
   sing His praises! Except the utterly incapacitated--but even these can
   magnify the Lord by their patience. We ought, everyone of us, if we are
   Christ's, to be serving Him.

   Am I a son, and have I no duty to my father? Am I a husband and have I
   no duties of kindness to the wife? Am I a servant and shall I be idle,
   careless and disobedient? Is the Christian's the only name that is
   merely nominal? Is this a barren title? Is this a medal to be worn? Is
   this a kind of cross which Christians shall take when they have done no
   deeds of arms, no valorous conflicts for Christ? Is the Christian only
   a thing and not a living reality? The Lord have mercy upon such
   Christians!

   NOW, dear Friends, if you want any inducements to lead you to bring all
   that you have to Christ, let me urge this. In bringing it to Him, put
   your talent into His hands, whose hands were pierced for you. You give
   to Him who is your dearest Friend. You give to Him who spared not the
   blood of His heart that He might redeem you. Do you not love Him? Is it
   not an honor to be permitted to show your love to so notable and noble
   a Personage? We have heard of women that have worked, and all but
   starved themselves, to bring food for their children. And as they put
   the precious morsels into the little ones' mouths, they felt their toil
   to be nothing, because they were giving it to those they loved. And so
   with the Believer--we should feel that he most blesses himself when he
   blesses Christ. And, indeed, when the Christian does anything for
   Jesus, it more blesses him that gives than Him that receives.

   Besides, when you give to Him, you have another inducement--that you
   are thus giving to the multitudes. I know people think, when they are
   doing something for the Church, that they are pleasing the minister. Or
   pleasing the deacons. Oh, dear Friends, it is not so! What interest
   have I in all the world but the love of poor souls? I pray that God,
   who reads the heart, shall say at the Day of Judgment that there lives
   not one who desires more disinterestedly the salvation of this world
   than the minister who addresses you now! And I trust I can speak the
   same of my Brethren in Christ, who long to see the world brought in.

   Look at that hungry world and when you give the bread, let those eyes
   that stare upon you, let those who eat so abundantly, thank you and let
   that be a sufficient recompense for what you have done. There is a man,
   I think, present now, who I remember, some two or three winters ago,
   came to me to join the Church. And when I sat down in the room to talk
   to him, I saw by the look of the poor man's face he wanted bread
   natural as well as bread spiritual. So I said, "Before I talk to you, I
   should like to see you a little refreshed." And we fetched him
   something to eat. I looked at him for a minute, for I saw his eyes
   glisten and I left the room, for fear he should not eat so much as if I
   were there.

   This, though I can tell you, when I saw the great pleasure with which
   he ate, it would have been sufficient compensation to me if that little
   had cost ten thousand pounds. And when you see the poor sinner lay hold
   of Christ so greedily and yet so joyfully--hen you see his gleaming
   eyes and the tears as they run down his cheeks--you will say, I am too
   well paid to have done good to such a poor heart as this. Lord, it is
   enough, I have fed these hungry souls.

   Once again, bring your loaves and fishes to Christ instead of following
   Christ to get loaves and fishes. Is it no inducement that you should,
   yourself, be the distributor? When we were children and our father cut
   off a small piece from the joint and sent it to a sick woman over the
   road, do we not remember how Thomas, Mary, and Ann used to quarrel for
   turns to take the basin over with the slice of meat? We always liked to
   knock at the good women's door and say, "Please, we have brought
   something for your dinner today." Children are always glad if there is
   something to give away. If you put a penny into their hands, to give to
   a poor blind man, how cheerfully they run! Just such a feeling as that
   the Christian has, when out of his talent, which he has consecrated to
   God, he does something for the world. He is going about among the ranks
   and feeding them, and he has joy in the deed.

   Then to close this point. "Bring them to Me and you shall have as much
   left as you had when you brought them." They took up of the fragments
   more than ever they gave. Christ will never let any man die in His
   debt. What you have done unto Him is abundantly repaid, if not in
   temporals, yet in spirituals. The fragments shall fill the baskets that
   are so liberally emptied. You shall find that while watering others you
   are yourself watered. The joy you impart shall be mutual. To do good is
   to get good, and to distribute to others for Christ is the surest way
   of enriching one's self.

   The rest of the Believer's duty I will briefly sum up. When you have
   brought your talents to Christ and have a conscientiousness of your
   great mission, your next duty is to look up. Thank God for what you
   have got--look up! Say-- "There is nothing in what I do. There is
   nothing in my prayers, my preaching, my goings, my doings, except You
   bless the whole. Lord, bless it!" Then, when you have blessed, break.
   Remember the multiplication never came till after the division and the
   addition did not begin till the subtraction took place.

   So, then, begin to break, do good, and communicate. Go abroad and
   actively serve the Master, and when you have thus broken and have thus
   distributed to others, mind that you only distribute from Christ's own
   hand. You are to put your talents and abilities into Christ's hand. He
   gives the blessing on it. Then He gives it back to you--afterwards, you
   give it to the people. If I give you bread from this pulpit to eat,
   that is my own--it will be of no use to you. But if, having gotten it
   in my study, I put it in the hand of Christ, and come up here and
   Christ hands it back to me and I give it to you, you shall be fed to
   the full.

   This is Christ's way of blessing men. He does not give the blessing
   first to the world--it is to His disciples and then the disciples to
   the multitude. We get in private what we distribute in public. We have
   access to God as His chosen favorites. We come near to Him. He gives to
   us, we give to others.

   Dear Friends, I began by setting before you a great and high mission.
   First, I made you say, "We cannot." Then I tried to make you say, "We
   must." And now I want to end by making you say "We can." Yes! Christ is
   with us, and we can! God is for us and we can! The Holy Spirit is in us
   and we can! God the Holy Spirit calls us, Jesus Christ the Son of God
   cheers us, God the Father smiles upon us. We can! We must! We will! The
   kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His
   Christ.

   But have we believed in Christ ourselves? If not, we can do nothing.
   Come to Jesus first, then work for Jesus. Give Him your own heart
   first, then give Him all that you have. So shall He accept your
   offering and bless your soul for His name's sake.

         "The Love Of Jesus--What It Is--None But His Loved Ones Know"

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON WEDNESDAY EVENING, JUNE 18, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT SURREY CHAPEL, BLACKFRIARS ROAD.

   "And to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge." Ephesians
   3:19.
   IT is the distinguishing mark of God's people that they know the love
   of Christ. Without exception all those who have passed from death unto
   life, whatever they may not know, have learned this. Without exception,
   all those who are not saved, whatever they may know besides, know
   nothing of this. An ungodly man may know something about Christ's love.
   He may believe in the fact of it. He may perceive something of the
   theory of it. He may even be able to follow Believers in certain'
   expressions of its enjoyments.
   But to know the love itself, to taste its sweets, to realize
   personally, experimentally, and vitally, the love of Christ as shed
   abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, is the privilege of the child
   of God, and of the child of God, alone. This is the secure enclosure
   into which the stranger cannot enter. This is the garden of the Lord,
   so well protected by walls and hedges that no wild boar of the woods
   can enter. Only the redeemed of the Lord shall walk here. They, and
   only they, may pluck the fruits and content themselves with the
   delights thereof.
   We may begin the exercises of this evening with a question of
   self-examination, and we may continue them throughout the whole
   service, trying to press that question home to your consciences--Do I
   know the love of Christ? Have I felt it? Do I understand it? Do I feel
   it now? Is it now shed abroad in my heart? Do I know that Jesus now
   loves me? Is my heart quickened, and animated, and warmed, and
   attracted towards Him through the great Truth of God that it recognizes
   and rejoices in--that Christ really loves me, and has chosen me, and
   set His heart upon me?
   We have started the first point. Every child of God knows the love of
   Christ. We advance another step. All the children of God do not know
   this love to the same extent. There are in Christ's family babes, young
   men, strong men, and a few who are fathers. Now, as they grow and
   progress in all other matters, so they most certainly make advances
   here. Indeed, an increase of love, a more perfect apprehension of
   Christ's love, is one of the best and most infallible gauges whereby we
   may test ourselves whether we have grown in Divine Grace or not.
   If we have grown in Grace, it is absolutely certain that we shall have
   advanced in our knowledge and reciprocation of the love of Christ. Many
   here present have believed in Jesus and they know the love of Jesus.
   But oh, they know it not as some others here do who have gone into the
   inner chamber and have been made to drink of the spiced wine of
   Christ's pomegranate! Some of you have begun to climb the mountain, and
   the view which lies at your feet is lovely and passing fair. But the
   landscape is not such as would greet your eyes if you could but stand
   where advanced saints are standing now--and could look to the east and
   to the west, to the north and to the south--and see all the lengths and
   breadths and depths and heights of the love of Christ which passes
   knowledge.
   To change the figure--the love of Christ is comparable to Jacob's
   ladder. Some of us are standing on the lower rungs, and there are
   others who are ascending and who rest half way. Others, still, are
   getting up so high that we can scarcely see them by reason of the
   dimness of our sight. And there are some, perhaps at this hour, who
   have just reached the topmost rung of this knowledge and are now
   stepping, as it were, into the arms of Christ who awaits them at the
   top! They have attained unto their perfection. Here they shall find
   repose. They shall rest in His love and with the eternal songs of
   Heaven they shall rejoice forever and forever.
   I want, tonight, to bring you, who are the people of God, to the bottom
   of the ladder. I want to encourage you to put your feet upon the first
   rung of it. And then go step by step with you, till, I hope, before we
   have done, if God the Holy Spirit is with us here, we shall have gotten
   very high up that ladder. And then we shall go away hoping never to
   come down again, only wishing, with Peter, that we may tarry on the
   mount and build for us tabernacles that we may sit on the summit of the
   mountain with our Lord forever.
   I. Well then, to come first of all to the bottom of the ladder. One of
   the lowest ways of knowing the love of Christ may be described as the
   doctrinal method--very useful one--but nothing to be compared to those
   that we shall have to mention afterwards. If a man would know the love
   of Christ, he should endeavor to study the Word of God with care,
   attention, constancy, and with dependence upon the Spirit's
   illumination that he may be enabled to understand aright.
   It is well for a Christian man to be thoroughly established in the
   faith once delivered to the saints. It is an ill day for a man when he
   ceases to hold fast to the form of sound words which was delivered to
   us by Christ Himself and His holy Apostles. Depend upon it, doctrinal
   ignorance will always make Churches weak. But where saints are fed upon
   the finest of the wheat, and are made to suck of the honey out of the
   rock, and to eat of the manna and fatness of Gospel doctrine, they
   will, all other things being equal, become the strongest and most
   valiant Believers on the face of the earth.
   There is a tendency in these times to depreciate the value of Gospel
   doctrines. Oh, I beseech you, be not led astray by this error. There
   are in the Word of God certain things really taught. Do not believe
   that the Bible is a lump of wax to be shaped just as you please. Do not
   imagine that, "Yes," is right, and that "No," which contradicts it, is
   right, too. The Lord has written this Book intending to teach us
   something, and a moderate understanding, sanctified by the teaching of
   the Holy Spirit, will enable you to know what the Lord does mean to
   teach you, especially upon such a vital point as this. Do not, I
   beseech you, say, "Oh, it does not much matter what doctrines I hold."

   You are as much responsible for using your judgment as you are for
   using your hands and your feet. God never did free a conscience from
   His jurisdiction. Conscience is free, but not before God. You have a
   right to your convictions as far as I am concerned. But if your
   convictions are wrong, you have no right to them before God. There are
   certain things that are Truths of God, and there are others that are
   contradictions--see that you get fast hold of Wisdom--and that you do
   not let her go.

   There is a tendency, however, on the other hand in certain quarters, to
   make doctrinal knowledge everything. I have seen, to my inexpressible
   grief, the Doctrines of Grace made a huge stone to be rolled at the
   mouth of the sepulcher of a dead Christ. And I have seen sound
   doctrine, so called, made as a very seal to seal in the dead Christ,
   lest by any means the energy of His Grace should come out for the
   salvation of sinners. Oh, what is doctrine, after all, but a throne
   whereon Christ sits? And when that throne is vacant, what is the throne
   to us? It is the Monarch and not the throne that we reverence and
   esteem.

   Doctrines are but as the shovel and the tongs of the altar, while
   Christ is the smoking sacrifice. Doctrines are Christ's
   garments--verily they all smell of myrrh and cassia and aloes out of
   ivory palaces, whereby they make us glad--but it is not the garments we
   care for so much as for the Person, the very Person of our Lord Jesus
   Christ. And therefore, while I entreat you, (and I hope not to be
   misunderstood here), while I entreat you to be very jealous and earnest
   in attaining unto a clear doctrinal knowledge of the love of Christ to
   His people, yet when you have got it, do not say--"I am the man! I have
   attained to eminence. I may now sit still and be content."

   Sirs, this is but the threshold. This is but one of the first arches of
   a long vista of glorious Truths of God. This is but the lowest step of
   the ascent. You have but sat down on the lowest form in the school. You
   have much to learn yet! Oh, be not wise in your own conceits, lest you
   lose the blessed things which as yet have not been discovered by you.
   Verily it is a sweet thing to know Christ's love in the doctrine, and
   to understand that it is without beginning. That it existed when as yet
   this world had not been made. When sun and moon and stars slept in the
   mind of God, like unborn forests in an acorn cup. When as yet the
   solemnity of silence had never been startled by the songs of seraphs,
   and the wings of cherubs had never stirred the unnavigated ether! It is
   delightful to believe that--

   "Before the day star knew its place, Or planets went their round, The
   saints in bonds of So vereign Grace, Were one with Jesus found."

   Equally precious is it to know the doctrine that this love is without
   end. When all we see around us shall have passed away, as the foam
   dissolves into the waves that bear it, the love of Christ to His people
   shall be the same. And on and on and on throughout eternity He shall
   never cast them from His heart. Sweet, too, is it, passing sweet, to
   know that He loves them without change and without limit. That He loves
   them because He will love them. That He loves them not for anything in
   them, but simply because He has so much love in His heart that He must
   let it out--and that He ordains to let it flow forth to them that they
   may rejoice in it.

   All this is precious but, O Brothers and Sisters, if you only know
   these things as they stand in the creed book--if you only understand
   them as you find them in the catechism--I tell you that you know
   nothing yet as you ought to know. If this is all your knowledge, you
   have just begun to learn. May God help you to go further, and to mount
   to higher and clearer regions than these. It is a blessed privilege to
   know Christ doctrinally, but it is only the beginning, the
   stepping-stone to something better, even as love longs for intimacy.

   II. And what next? Let us lift our feet and take another step. True
   saints know Christ's love gratefully and thankfully, having experienced
   it. O dear Friends! Let me refresh your memories and tell you what you
   do know, rather than attempt to say anything which might be new to you.
   Do you remember the place, the spot of ground where Jesus met with you?
   Some of us do. Oh, that day of days! That first day of our spiritual
   life! Other days have lost their freshness in our recollection, but
   this one is like a coin newly minted from time, though it is years ago
   with some of us. Oh, that day! That marriage day! That feast day! That
   day of Heaven on earth! Our soul was burdened and bowed down to the
   very dust, and we thought we should soon descend into the pit where
   despair would be our portion forever. But as we went mourning on our
   way, we heard a voice saying to us--

   "Come here soul, I am the way."

   We turned our eyes to see what way this could be, when lo, we saw One
   nailed to a Cross. We marked the blood as it flowed from His hands and
   feet and side. We saw His eyes as they looked on us with inexpressible
   compassion. And we heard Him as He opened His lips and said, "Come unto
   Me, you weary one, and I will give you rest." Oh, do you remember when
   you looked unto Him and when you came to trust Him--just as you
   were--with your soul? You had been learning about Christ, perhaps, for
   years. You had been taught about Him. You had got some knowledge of Him
   and some desire towards Him. But did you not learn more of Christ in
   one five minutes then, than you could have learned in a whole course of
   college education in theology, in years before?

   And since that time, dear Friends, have we not learned Christ's love
   thankfully to a very high degree? Day after day He comes to us. Night
   after night He draws the curtains of our bed. He is ever with us and
   all that He has is ours. He talks sweetly to us by the way, and He sits
   down by us in our afflictions and comforts us, and makes our hearts to
   burn within us. And as we think of all that He has done for us, we feel
   we do know something of Him, for gratitude has been our schoolmaster.

   I know some Christians say they do not feel the love of Christ so much
   now as they did at first. Oh, shame on you, Brethren, shame on you, if
   this is true! What? When you owed Him for one mercy, did you love Him?
   And now when you owe Him for fifty thousand, do you love Him less? Why,
   if it is true that saints grow necessarily colder and colder, then it
   does not say much for their estimation of Christ. It would make Him out
   to be like some people we know, who are very agreeable to see once in a
   while, but we should not like to live with them long.

   Let me share my witness that my Lord and Master improves upon
   acquaintance. The more I know of Him, the more I wish to know. And I
   think I do but speak the mind of all the Lord's people when I declare
   that instead of having less love to Him, the more I experience of His
   favor, the more warm is my heart towards Him. "Alas," says one, "but I
   do not feel as I once did." Well, dear Friend, it may be that you make
   some mistake in reference to your own experience. When the passion of
   love was first lighted in your breast, there was, as it were, a blaze
   of the match, the paper and the wood, although the coals had not yet
   ignited.

   Yours was then the flush of joy, but not the vehement heat. Now your
   heart is all on fire like a solid ruby. There is much more heat, though
   there is less blaze. So it is with some young converts. The first love
   they have is wildfire, and to tell you the truth, I would rather have
   wildfire than no fire at all. But as men grow older in Divine Grace,
   the fire will not diminish in intensity, if God has kindled it. But
   perhaps the flash and the flame, the glitter and the noise, may not be
   quite so palpable.

   Yet I fear that if you do not love Christ better than you did. If you
   do not feel that there are new tendrils which bind you to Him. If you
   do not feel that it would be harder now than ever to give up your hold
   on the Savior, you have not begun to learn the love of Christ. When we
   know that love, when we feel gratitude for mercies received, then we
   see every mercy, both temporal and spiritual, coming from that love.
   Ungrateful souls cannot learn this love. They have the book of mercy
   but they are blind and cannot read it. Grateful souls, in every letter
   from Jesus, their absent Friend, whom having not seen, they love, and
   in every book of daily fellowship, and of daily mercy, read again that
   glittering sentence-- "He loved me and gave Himself for me."

   III. Let us pass on to the third step, we have not got far yet. We are
   only as schoolboys at our first school, and we have now to go on to
   something higher. The true children of God know Christ's love in a way
   which I can only describe by the word practically. If any man would
   know His doctrine, let him keep His commandments. You know if a man is
   to be taught to swim, you could not teach him in Surrey Chapel. You
   might get the most skillful master in the world who should come and
   explain the way in which he should spread his hands and move his feet,
   but he never can be taught to swim on dry land.

   And we cannot make Christians know Christ except by imitating Christ
   and by obeying Christ. When soldiers are wanted, the best place to make
   them is, doubtless, the battlefield. If we would have veterans, there
   must be the smoke and the smell of powder, for great commanders are not
   to be manufactured in Hyde Park. And we cannot expect to have men who
   shall win victories, drawn out from mere loungers at the clubs. They
   must attend the drills, and by practice become qualified for their
   duties. A young man cannot learn farming by the study of books. To read
   books may be useful, if he takes them as companions to the great book
   of nature.

   He must be made apprentice to some farmer who sends him out into the
   fields to see how they plow, how they sow, how they mow, how they reap,
   and how they house their corn. By entering practically into the various
   toils and duties, he becomes skilled in them. Just so, if we would
   learn Christ, we must be practically engaged in His service. We must
   learn His love by keeping His Commandments. You may sit in these pews
   and be preached to every Sunday. You may hear God's Truth plainly and
   simply unfolded. But if you want to learn, and learn in such a way that
   you never will forget, it is the back streets that must teach you, the
   lodging houses, the haunts of poverty, and the dens of vice.

   If any man would know the love of Christ, let him go where Christ went
   and to the place where a Savior is needed. Let him carry Christ's light
   to give light to others, and it shall enlighten himself. Let him go
   forth to water other men's vineyards, and his own soul shall be
   watered, also. Whatever his Master bids him do, let him do it, and he
   shall learn his Master's will while he is doing his Master's will. But
   when men, at the very outset, make a profession of religion and then
   disobey Christ--when they refuse to keep His Commandments--when they
   say of this one, "It is non-essential." And of the next, "It is
   unnecessary."

   And when they say of some duty, "Well, I can leave that to others." And
   of some sphere of action for which they are especially adapted, "I need
   not attend to that. Others can do that quite as well"--when men, I say,
   enlist into Christ's army and begin at once to refuse to march as they
   are told, and decline to go out to battle when the Captain gives them
   the command--it is a sure sign that they never will learn much of their
   Master, their Captain and their Lord. If you had asked Whitfield in his
   day, how he came to know so much about Christ's love, I think he would
   have said that he learned more of it when he stood in Moorfields, or on
   Kennington Common, when the dead cats and filth were thrown at him as
   he preached Christ, than he ever learned in his bedchamber, or even in
   his closet.

   If you had asked Rowland Hill how it was that he had learned so much of
   the love of Christ, I think he would have told you that he learned it
   while he was speaking to the poor, and to the needy, and while he was
   condescending to men of low estate, that by any means he might win
   some. Why, if a man should want to know about slavery, he might go and
   hear a lecture by an escaped slave and it would be very well for him to
   do so. But if he could go to the place where the whip is cracking, and
   the back is bleeding, and see the thing for himself--then he would
   understand the cruelty of slavery, indeed.

   So, if a man would know the love of Christ, he must lay himself out to
   discover the deformity of sin, and the awful degradation into which
   crime casts mankind. And then he will know that love which stoops from
   the highest Heaven, reaches down to the gates of the deepest Hell,
   thrusts its arms up to the very elbows in the mire to pull these
   accursed ones out of the pit of distraction and make them blessed
   forever among the shining ones before the Truth of God. Strict and
   practical obedience to the Master's commands gives an amount of
   knowledge which is not to be attained by sentiments of gratitude, much
   less by systems of doctrine.

   This is a higher stage of Divine Grace, though not much higher. Yet, I
   would to God that more of us had even got here, for I fear there are
   many who have a name to live but who do not obey Christ. Many, perhaps,
   to whom the minis- ter's command would be more potent than Christ's
   command, and upon whom the law of the land would have far more
   influence than the Law of Christ. A Believer ought to be such a one
   that a mere word from Christ is enough for him. Or, as a Quaker was
   likely to express it, his heart should be like a cork upon the waters,
   which every undulation of the waves would affect. Thus should his heart
   float, as it were, in the Spirit's influences, till every motion of the
   Holy Spirit, every Law and wish of Christ should affect him instantly.

   I would be passively active--if you can comprehend such a
   contradiction--I would be passive, so as never to have will or wish of
   my own. And active, so as to have the will and wish of Christ impelling
   me always to keep His commands. When a man comes here, he begins to
   show real progress in knowing "the love of Christ which passes
   knowledge."

   IV. There is a fourth and higher stage, by far, than these. There is a
   way, not known to many moderns, but much practiced by the ancients, of
   knowing the love of Christ by contemplation. Do you know that in the
   early ages of the Church they spoke more of Christ and of His Person,
   and thought more of Him than we do? When I have sometimes read the
   fathers, and some of the devotional books of Believers who are not much
   known, I have frequently had to say, "Well, I do not see much here
   about justification by faith, but I see a great deal about the efficacy
   of the precious blood."

   I do not read, perhaps, about the pardon of sin, but I read about the
   blood-shedding, and about being washed therein. The early preachers
   preached not so much of the Atonement--though they preached it--it was
   the five wounds, the bloody sweat, the Cross, and the passion. We talk
   of the fruits and the effects. They seem to speak of the first great
   cause--the Man, the Christ, the Cross, the vinegar, the nails, the
   spear, the cry of, "It is finished," the "Lama Sabac-thani," the burial
   and the Resurrection. And in those times, whether or not it was that
   men had not so much to do as they have now, I cannot tell, but they
   found time to have long seasons of contemplation. And they would sit
   alone and worship and draw near to Christ and steadily fix their gaze
   upon His Person.

   To them He was a real Person, whom the eye of their faith could see as
   clearly as the eye of sense can see outward objects. They looked, and
   looked, and looked again, till the love of Christ grew brighter to them
   than the sun at his meridian, and for very dimness of mortal sight they
   veiled their faces and paused their speech--while their souls were
   bathed in inward joy and peace unspeakable. There have been some such
   in these later times but not many. There was Isaac Ambrose, author of
   that book, "Looking Unto Jesus." He was pastor of a Church at Preston,
   in Lancashire, and, "it was his usual custom once a year," says Dr.
   Calumy, "for the space of a month to retire into a little hut in a
   wood. And avoiding all human converse, to devote himself to
   contemplation."

   It was true he then only had eleven months in the year to preach, but
   those eleven were a great deal better than the twelve would otherwise
   have been. For there, alone with his Master, he received such riches
   from Him, that when he came back, he threw about jewels with both his
   hands and scattered glorious thoughts and words broadcast in his
   ministry. That book, "Looking Unto Jesus," is a blessed memorial of his
   quiet hours and his secret communion with Jesus.

   Then there was Rutherford, the man who has expounded the whole of
   Solomon's Song without knowing it, in his celebrated letters. When he
   was in the dungeon at Aberdeen, he exclaimed, first of all, "I had only
   one eye and they put that out." It was the preaching of the Gospel, and
   before long he has got both his eyes back again. Hear him writing in
   his letters, "My foes thought to punish me by casting me into a prison
   but lo! they have blessed me by taking me into Christ's withdrawing
   room, where I sit with Him and am with Him both night and day without
   disturbance."

   The expressions he sometimes uses are so rapturous that I would not
   quote them here. Love letters are not to be read in the streets, and
   the words which souls inflamed with heavenly fire sometimes use towards
   Christ are not fit for public repetition. For there are passages of
   love, there are street embraces of affection which we must not tell,
   for this were to commit a treason such as Paul might have done if he
   had told on earth those words which he had heard in Heaven, and which
   it would not be lawful for a man to utter here.

   Do you know anything about this, dear Friends? Oh, I pray you do not
   think I dream! These things are realities. I pray you think not that I
   am enthusiastic or fanatical. There are many Believers who could tell
   you that it is their daily delight to be much with Christ. Oh, perhaps
   some of you know what it is to have Christ with you in your shop. Your
   hands are busy weighing your goods or measuring out your wares, but
   Christ is with you, and your hearts are content. Or, as I remember
   hearing an old saint say one Sunday, when he was preaching from that
   text he pronounced so strangely, "When I saw Him I fell at His feet as
   dead."

   "Ah," he said, "you do not know where I live. You think I live at
   so-and-so, in such-and-such a street, but I do not, for I am dead, and
   my life is hid with Christ in God." Now there are some saints who,
   though they are in the world, are dead to it. It has no attractions for
   them. It cannot get their hearts. Their hearts are with Jesus. They are
   not here. And they have sent their souls onward to that place where
   their bodies are one day to go, to the Throne where Jesus sits and
   reigns.

   I remember hearing these expressions once used at a Prayer Meeting.
   They struck my mind and they still abide in my memory. A Brother had
   been praying and had asked a very great benefit. "O Lord," he said,
   "give me Mary's place--

   'Oh, that I might forever sit With Mary at the Master's feet, Be this
   my happy choice.'

   Lord, I would sit at Your feet and hear what You have to say and
   receive it as a willing scholar receives his master's words." I thought
   he would stop there but he said, "No, Lord, I have not asked enough. I
   have not asked according to the royalty of Your nature. Lift me higher!
   Lift me higher! Not at Your feet would I sit, but I would lean upon
   Your breast. Oh, put me where John was, so I may lean my head upon Your
   bosom. Let me not merely learn the Truth You teach, but may I feel Your
   heart beat and know Your love to me--

   'Oh that I might with holy John
   Forever lean my head upon
   The bosom of my Lord.' "

   Well now, I thought that second prayer was a noble one. But he had yet
   a third one to offer and he said, "No, Lord, no. That is not enough. I
   have not asked yet according to the tenor of Your promise. You have
   lifted me from Your feet to your breast, now lift me higher, to your
   lips." And then he quoted the words of the song--"Let Him kiss me with
   the kisses of His mouth, for His love is better than wine." And he very
   beautifully paraphrased it like this--"Lord, let me give to You the
   tokens of my love, and receive from You the present tokens of Your love
   to me. And not only know it, and feel Your heart beat, but receive the
   token of it as my lips of prayer meet Your lips of blessing, and my
   lips of thanksgiving touch Your lips of benediction."

   Oh, there are heights and depths in this blessed contemplative life
   which I must not tell you here! And I thank God that there are some men
   who, though they go very far wrong in doctrine, are very right on this
   point. And if they are right here, verily, they are right in the
   essentials. When a man can come right up to Christ and throw his arms
   around Him. When he can say, "That blood is mine. That Christ is my
   joy. His love is my love. His Presence is my Heaven, His Character is
   my great example. I trust in Him, and I love Him"--that man may say
   fifty things that are not right, but he has said the things that are
   essentially right--and his soul is safe.

   "Well," says one, "I shall never get to know Christ's love by
   contemplation. I have no time." Ah, you had better have an hour's less
   sleep than lose this blessed contemplation of Christ. "Oh but I have so
   much to do." Dear Friends, we can sometimes do more in one half an hour
   than we can do at other times in hours, according to the tenor of our
   minds. Now, I think that contemplating Christ winds up the soul and
   puts it into a right frame, so that when we come back we can do more
   for the Master than we ever did before.

   Perhaps you have seen them driving piles in the marshes. There is a
   large piece of timber that has to be driven deep into the ground, and
   you have seen those pile-driving machines. There is an immense weight
   and they pull it up, and up and up, before they let it fall. Now, if
   they only pull it up a little way and then let it drop--well it comes
   down with some force--but not a great deal. But when they lift it as
   high as ever they can draw it up and then let it come down at once, why
   what a drive it gives the pile! It is the going up that gives it such
   force in coming down.

   And I believe that those are the best sermons for driving the Truth of
   God into the sinner's heart that come from ministers who have been
   wound up very high before they come down in the sermon. And I think
   your usefulness will be sure to be powerful and mighty, if in private
   you are wound up to the very summit of contemplative delight by
   thinking of the work, the sufferings, and the triumphs of Christ.
   Certainly the sweetness of it alone is reward, and then the benefit
   which follows will be a sevenfold recompense for a most pleasant
   exercise.

   V. Well now, we have taken you up some height but we must prepare for a
   flight which is higher, still. To know the love of Christ which passes
   knowledge by contemplation is very high--but there is a higher stage
   than this. There are times when I almost fear to speak of these things,
   but there are some here, surely, who will understand me, some here who
   have passed through the same state, and will not think that I am
   dreaming. There are times when the soul has long contemplated Christ,
   and there are some who know not only to contemplate but to enjoy. Even
   on earth, faith sometimes gives place to a present and conscious
   enjoyment.

   There are times with the Believer when whether he is in the body, or
   out of the body, he can scarcely tell. God knows, and though not caught
   up to the third Heaven, he is brought to the very gates, and if not
   permitted to see Christ on His Throne, he does so see Him on His Cross,
   that if an infidel should say to him, "There is no Christ," he could
   say, "I have seen Him. My eyes have looked upon Him, and my hands have
   touched Him after a spiritual sort." There are many such rapturous
   seasons as this on record in the biographies of good men. I shall quote
   but one or two, and I hope there are some here who have known them in
   their own experience.

   In the life of Mr. Flavel, who was one of the most temperate of the
   Puritans, and one not at all given to anything like fanaticism, there
   is an event mentioned which once occurred to him. He said that being
   once on a journey alone on horseback, the thought of the love of Christ
   came upon him with great power. And as he rode gently along the road,
   the thought seemed to increase in force and strength, till at last he
   forgot all about earth, and even where he was. Somehow or other his
   horse stood still but he did not notice it. And when he came to
   himself, through some passerby observing him, he found that he had bled
   very copiously during the time. Getting off his horse he washed his
   face at the brook and he said, "I did verily think as I stood there,
   that if I was not in Heaven, I could hardly hope to be more blessed in
   Heaven than I was then."

   He mounted his horse and rode on to a place of lodging where he was to
   pass the night. Supper was brought in but left untasted on the table.
   He sat all night long without sleep, enjoying the presence of Christ,
   and he says, "I was more rested that night than with any sleep I ever
   had, and I heard and saw in my soul, by faith, such things as I had
   never known before." The like occurred to Mr. Tennant, who was a man
   who spent many hours in private, and sometimes, when it was time to
   preach, he was quite unable to stand unless first carried into his
   pulpit. Then he would put his hands out and lean there and say such
   glorious things of Christ, that those who looked upon him verily
   thought that they looked upon the face of an angel.

   Rutherford, too, is another specimen. When he preached about Christ, he
   preached so wonderfully, that on any other subject he was not at all
   like himself. And the Duke of Argyle was once so warmed when Rutherford
   got upon that subject, that he cried out in Church--"Now, Man, you are
   on the right strain! Keep to it." And he did keep to it, and the little
   man's thin voice seemed to swell with supernatural grandeur when he
   began to talk of his precious, precious Lord Jesus, and to extol and
   exalt Him who was the Bridegroom of his soul, his Brother and his
   blessed Companion.

   "Oh, these are flights of the imagination," you say. Yes, they may be,
   indeed, Beloved. But if you could get them some times, you would come
   back to the world's cares and troubles like giants refreshed with new
   wine, caring nothing for anything that might happen. Christ would be so
   sweetly and blessedly within you, that you could bear the burden and
   think nothing of it. And though the grasshopper was a burden before,
   you could now carry it right readily.

   Well, I have taken you up to where not many go in these times, but I
   hope there are some who will yet ascend there till they shall even
   embrace Christ, and who will sit down at His table till they shall know
   Ralph Erskine's blessed sickness of love and, in the conscious
   enjoyment of a precious Savior, shall say in the words of the spouse,
   "Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am sick of love.
   His left hand is under my head and His right hand does embrace me."

   VI. But I want to take you higher than this. Not higher in some senses,
   but higher, really, for these raptures are, of course, only like
   angels' visits, few and far between. But here is something which may be
   more lasting and which, certainly, is a higher state of mind as to the
   knowledge of Christ. To know Christ sympathetically, is a yet higher
   stage than any to which we have attained before. What do I mean by
   this? I will show you, first of all, what I do not mean. We will
   suppose ourselves standing on the brow of the hill with Jerusalem in
   the alley below. Jerusalem is to be destroyed by the Romans. The decree
   has gone forth that its sin must be punished.

   Now, here is a Brother who holds very high doctrines in his head, but
   who has not much sympathy in his heart. Come up here, Brother. Do you
   see that city there? That is all to be destroyed! Do you see its
   streets? They are all to be crimsoned with blood! Do you see its
   temple? Not one stone of it is to be left upon another! What do you
   think of it? "Well," he says, "if they are to be saved, they will be
   saved. If it is in the purpose and the decree it will be so. I am sure
   I am very sorry if they should not be, but I do not see that it is any
   particular business of mine. The Lord will have His own and it will all
   be well."

   Get down, Sir! What do you know about the love of Christ? Nothing! Give
   such a man as you that text, "He beheld the city and wept over it," and
   you would not know how to preach from it, for you do not know the
   Savior's heart, and have not known His love.

   But bring here another man. He holds the same doctrinal truths, but he
   looks down on the city and what does he say?--

   "Oh, gladly my pity would reclaim
   And snatch the firebrands from the flame."

   "Lord, what must I do? Give me anything to do for them! My heart's
   desire and prayer for them is that they may be saved." And the tears
   begin to flow, and when he turns to the Book and reads that Jesus
   beheld the city and wept over it and said, "If you at least in this,
   your day, had known the things which belong unto your peace," he says,
   "Well, I do not know how to explain that to my doctrinal friend. I do
   not know how to make these feelings quite square and tally with the
   doctrine. But somehow or other I know there is no disagreement, for I
   feel the one is true, and I also feel the sympathy in my heart. I know
   that God will have His own, but I hope He will have them through my
   instrumentality. I believe that His chosen will be brought in, but, O
   that it may be my happy lot to bring in some of them to the praise and
   the glory of

   His Grace!"

   "Why," some professors say, "I am not my Brother's keeper." No, but if
   you are not, I tell you what you are--you are your Brother's killer!
   You are one of the two. If you say are not your Brother's keeper, rest
   assured that you are a Cain, and that you will be your Brother's
   murderer--for we either do good or hate. It is impossible for us to be
   devoid of influence. If the rill runs through the marshes it makes them
   fertile. If you dam it up and make it stagnant, you have not destroyed
   its influence. Ah, no, you have only changed it into a fetid pool and
   its influence shall curse the valley with disease.

   So with a good man. If he serves his Master, he is scattering mercy
   abroad. But let him, if it were possible for him to do so, let him
   cease to serve the Lord, and become idle, and then he scatters plague
   and death. Oh, do we know the love of Christ by feeling it in our own
   hearts? There are some of us who can say that we have felt that we
   could do anything for souls. When we have heard it said of the Master,
   "He saved others, Himself He cannot save," we have felt that we would
   not spare ourselves if God would only spare them. And when Paul said he
   could wish himself accursed from Christ for his Brethren, while
   commentators have been thinking that over, and cannot make it out, we
   have had sympathy with it and have been able to say, "We have felt the
   same."

   We have felt that we could even be lost to save others and we have
   said, "Let my name perish. Let me be forgotten if my congregation may
   only be saved. If my children may be blessed. If my hearers may be
   converted to God." Men in this state know Christ's love after a
   wonderful and marvelous sort. May God teach you each this way. May He
   help you to weep like Christ, to work like Christ--yes, and to be ready
   to die like Christ--if it were necessary by such means to bring sinners
   to their Savior and their Lord. O that we could get here!

   I know my dear Brother, the pastor of this Church, would desire nothing
   more for you than that you might know Christ's love by feeling it in
   your hearts. O that Christ would come and look out of these eyes and
   weep down these cheeks! O that He would speak through these lips, till
   it should not be the old self, man, that thought, and spoke, and
   acted--but the new-born Spirit of the Lord Jesus that had come into us
   and possessed us with a higher and a nobler life--that we might spend
   and be spent for Him!

   I think I shall have but one step further to take you, though there are
   some which are higher still. Before I do so I must tell you one
   anecdote to guard you against a possible mistake. There is a tendency,
   in the contemplative knowledge of Christ's love, to self-indulgence. I
   know at the present moment a dear servant of Christ. I shall always
   regard him as such. He may be known to some of you, though I would not
   like to mention his name. He was once a notable minister in this city
   and was exceedingly useful. He began the contemplative life.

   He lived very near to Christ and his preaching was exceedingly sweet to
   his hearers. There were many converts. He had a large Church and it
   exceedingly prospered. But so sweet were his private enjoyments that he
   began to relax in his public duties. He did preach, but he seldom
   allowed himself to see his hearers, and at last arrived at such a pitch
   of re- tirement, that he could walk into his pulpit without even
   speaking to his deacons, and then deliver himself. But the man's
   usefulness ceased. Though still a gracious soul, yet he has missed his
   way, and ceased to be one of the honored leaders of Christ's Church.

   Now, there is a tendency, a wrong tendency, mark you, of getting so
   high and not wanting to get any higher. Even the contemplative life,
   itself, ought only to be considered as a steppingstone to something
   beyond. And when we get to the very highest point, we are still to say
   with Paul, as we sit down upon the milestone, "Not as though I had
   already attained, either were already perfect: but this one thing I do,
   forgetting the things which are behind, press forward to those which
   are before."

   It is related of a certain monk, who, having been long in his cell
   alone, thought while in his devotions that he saw the Lord Jesus. Of
   course the tale is a fable, but I relate it for the sake of its moral.
   He thought he saw the Lord before him as crucified, and he heard His
   voice speaking sweet and comfortable words to him. Just at that moment,
   when his soul was in a very flood of delight, he heard the convent bell
   ring, and he remembered it was his turn to go out to the gate and give
   away bread to the beggars who stood there.

   Oh, he had never heard that bell ring so dolefully before! It seemed to
   him like the knell of all his joys. The impulse of duty, however, was
   stronger than that of delight, and he went his way with a heavy heart
   to distribute the bread. As he came back to his cell, he thought, "Ah,
   I shall never see that again! Christ is gone from me, and I shall never
   know these enjoyments again!" When, to his surprise, there was the
   vision still. As he bowed before it with delight, he heard a voice
   which said, "If you had stayed I would have gone. But since you did My
   work I tarried to give you your reward."

   Now, there is a tendency, when we have been alone and in private, and
   have had sweet fellowship with Christ, for us to feel--"I do not want
   to go out from this. I do not want to be disturbed just now. I would
   rather not do anything just now." I do not suppose there are very many
   of you who get into this state, but there may be some who think at such
   times, "I do not want to preach today. I would rather not do anything.
   It is best that I should be alone."

   Ah, it is a strong temptation, and you must strive against it and say,
   "No, I have enjoyments in my religion, but I did not seek my religion
   for the enjoyment it would give me. I must look higher than that, to
   the God I serve, and to the Lord and Master whose I am. I love the
   jewels He gives me to wear upon my fingers, but I love His Person
   better. I am not to look upon these rings and forget to look into His
   eyes. I love the sweet couch that He makes for me at night, but I am
   not to lie there and forget the fields that are to be plowed and the
   battles that are to be fought. I must be up and doing. The
   contemplative life must lead me to duty and then shall I know Christ
   even as I am known.

   VII. And now, the last and highest step of all, upon which we can only
   say a few words, is that which is called by deep writers and
   experienced Believers on this point, the absorbing love of Christ. How
   shall I tell you what this is? I cannot, except I quote Wesley's
   words--

   "Oh, love Divine, how sweet you are! When shall I find my willing heart
   All taken up with you?"

   "I thirst"--can you get as far as that? "I faint"--that is a high
   state, indeed! "/die"--that is the top--

   "I thirst, I faint, I die to prove The fullness of redeeming love, The
   love of Christ to me."

   "I live. Yet not I, but Christ lives in me," said the Apostle Paul, and
   that is where we must get--when the man ceases to feel himself, the
   "I"--and only recognizes himself as part of Christ. It is our
   individuality that we really have to get rid of in this matter. It is
   our selfish separateness, I mean. We need to feel that we are a part of
   Christ, a member of His body, flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone.

   We have to get to where we have no more desire to act, or think, or
   feel according to anything that is here--but to send our hearts up to
   the great heart of Christ in Heaven--only tarrying here while our souls
   are walking the golden streets with Christ. I do not know if I might be
   bold enough to say, "Blessed is the man who shall be able to attain to
   the state when that which thinks is the head of Christ, and that which
   feels is the heart of Christ--when the great seat of all the
   sensations, spiritually, is in Christ, and not in himself and he
   himself is--

   "Plunged into the Godhead's sea And lost in its immensity."

   "The Brahmins believe that the highest perfection is to be absorbed
   into God, and there is a certain truth in it, though not as they mean
   it. When we are lost in God we are highest. When it is not we, but
   Christ--and we have come to be with Him and His heart is ours, and His
   love and soul, and wish are ours--then it is that we comprehend the
   height and depth and length and breadth and know the love of Christ
   which passes knowledge.

   Now, I have not said much tonight to the ungodly. But if I could make
   any of you feel your mouths a-watering after Christ by what I have
   said, I should be pleased, indeed. Oh, if you did but know the
   sweetness of the love of Christ, you would not be careless about it--

   "His worth, if all the nations knew, Surely the whole world would love
   Him, too." Blind bat's eyes are those that cannot see beauty in Christ!
   Hard, stony hearts, that cannot feel any love to Him! What do you say,
   Sinner? Do you say, "O that I knew Christ's love! O that I knew His
   love to me!" Sinner, He has sent me to you tonight to preach His
   Gospel. And it is His Gospel, though not the Gospel which some preach,
   for I have heard some finish their sermons thus--"Go home and pray. Go
   home and do your best to find Christ."

   All this is good enough advice but it is not the Gospel. The Gospel
   is--"Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." Believe
   in the Lord Jesus Christ. To believe in Christ is to trust in Him. That
   is all it is--to trust in Him. "But I must repent," one says.
   Repentance is a change of mind, and is a blessed fruit of faith and
   comes with faith. That repentance which comes before faith is not true
   repentance, for it is a repentance that needs to be repented of. Where
   there is no faith, it is impossible to please God.

   That repentance which has no faith in it must be displeasing to God,
   and needs to be repented of. The first business you have, Sinner, is
   not to feel anything, but to put your trust in Christ. Your business is
   not to try to make yourselves fit to come to Christ, but to come to Him
   just as you are. You are to trust Christ and to trust Him now. "Oh but
   I am a black with sin!" Come and be washed. "Oh but I am a naked
   sinner." Come and be clothed. "But I am lost." Oh, Sirs, the Master has
   come to seek and to save that which is lost. You are not to find
   yourselves first, and then think He will come and find you. He is come
   to seek you.

   Hark! While the trumpet sounds in the street without meaning, I would
   sound the Gospel trumpet here. Come and welcome! Come just as you are!
   To come is to trust and simply to fall flat at the foot of the Cross
   and say, "Jesus, I trust You to save me." That done, you are saved, and
   your sin is gone. He took it and was punished for it. You are righteous
   in God's sight, for His righteousness is yours, and you are saved.
   Christ, the Head, is your Representative. You are delivered. Christ has
   broken the neck of your foe, and you are emancipated the very moment
   when you believe.

   Some persons dislike instantaneous conversions. Let them read the Bible
   and see what sorts of conversion are there. There is Saul of Tarsus,
   there is the Philippian jailer. There are the three thousand on the day
   of Pentecost--these are all instantaneous conversions. There is a man
   over there, near the door, who came in here. Perhaps he did not know
   what for, or to listen to some strange, out-of-the-way matter. That
   man, if Christ shall meet with him tonight, and lead him in the way of
   His Grace, may go out of this Chapel as much saved as if it were seven
   years ago when he first believed on Jesus, for--

   "The moment a sinner believes And trusts in a crucified God," he is
   saved, it is all done! The work is finished and there is no need that
   anything else should be done. The robe of righteousness has been
   completed. There is not a stitch to be added to it.

   Sinner, this is the glory of the Gospel. Trust Jesus and you are saved
   and saved forever, beyond the reach of destruction. May God meet with
   some soul here tonight, and especially may He now stir up you, His
   people, to grow in Divine Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ. Amen and Amen.

                            The Stony Heart Removed

   A Sermon

   (No. 456)

   Delivered on Sunday Evening, May 25th, 1862, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give
   you an heart of flesh."--Ezekiel 36:26.

   THE FALL of man was utter and entire. Some things when they have become
   dilapidated may be repaired; but the old house of mankind is so
   thoroughly decayed that it must be pulled down even to its foundation,
   and a new house must be erected. To attempt mere improvement is to
   anticipate a certain failure. Manhood is like an old garment that is
   rent and rotten; he that would mend it with new cloth doth but make the
   rent worse. Manhood is like one of the old skin bottles of the
   Orientals; he who would put the new wine into it shall find that the
   bottles will burst, and his wine will be lost. Old shoes and clouted
   might be good enough for Gibeonites; but we are so thoroughly outworn
   that we must be made new, or thrown upon the dunghill. It is a wonder
   of wonders that such a thing is possible. If a tree loses its branch, a
   new branch may spring out; if you cut into the bark and mark the
   letters of your name, in process of time the bark may heal its own
   wound, and the mark may be erased. But who could give a new heart to
   the tree? Who could put new sap into it? By what possibility could you
   change its inner structure? If the core were smitten with death, what
   power but the divine could ever restore it to life? If a man has
   injured his bones, the fractured parts soon send forth a healing
   liquid, and the bone is by-and-bye restored to its former strength, if
   a man hath youth on his side. But if a man's heart were rotten, how
   could that be cured? If the heart were a putrid ulcer, if the very
   vitals of the man were rotten, what human surgery, what marvellous
   medicine could touch a defect so radical as this? Well did our hymn
   say:

   "Can aught beneath a power divine

   The stubborn will subdue?

   'Tis thine, eternal Spirit, thine,

   To form the heart anew.

   To chase the shades of death away

   And bid the sinner live!

   A beam of heaven, a vital ray,

   'Tis thine alone to give."

   But while such a thing would be impossible apart from God, it is
   certain that God can do it. Oh, how the Master delighteth to undertake
   impossibilities! To do what others can do were but like unto man; but
   to accomplish that which is impossible to the creature is a mighty and
   noble proof of the dignity of the Creator. He delighteth to undertake
   strange things; to bring light out of darkness; order out of confusion;
   to send life into the dead; to heal the leprosy; to work marvels of
   grace and mercy, and wisdom, and peace--these, I say, God delighteth to
   do; and so, while the thing is impossible to us, it is possible to him.
   And more, its impossibility to us commends it to him, and makes him the
   more willing to undertake it, that he may thus glorify his great name.

   According to the Word of God, man's heart is by nature like a stone;
   but God, through his grace, removes the stony heart and gives a heart
   of flesh. It is this prodigy of love, this miracle of grace, which is
   to engage our attention to-night. I trust we shall speak now, not of
   something that has happened to others only, but of a great wonder which
   has been wrought in ourselves. I trust we shall talk experimentally,
   and hear personally, and feel that we have an interest in these
   splendid deeds of divine love.

   Two things we shall talk of to-night. First, the stony heart and its
   dangers; secondly, the heart of flesh and its privileges.

   I. Some few words upon THE STONY HEART AND ITS DANGERS. Why is the
   heart of man compared to a stone at all?

   1. First, because, like a stone it is cold. Few persons like to be
   always treading upon cold stones in their houses, and hence we floor
   our habitations; and it is thought to be a part, of the hardship of the
   prisoner if he has nothing to sit down or rest upon but the cold, cold
   stone. You may heat a stone for a little season if you thrust it into
   the fire, but for how short a time will it retain its heat; and though
   it glowed just now, how very soon it loses all its warmth and returns
   again to its native coldness. Such is the heart of man. It is warm
   enough towards sin; it it grows hot as coals of juniper, towards its
   own lusts; but naturally the heart is as cold as ice towards the things
   of God. You may think you have heated it for a little season under a
   powerful exhortation, or in presence of a solemn judgment, but how soon
   it returns to its natural state! We have heard of one who, seeing a
   large congregation all weeping under a sermon, said, "What a wonderful
   thing to see so many weeping under the truth!" and another added, "But
   there is a greater wonder than that--to see how they leave off weeping
   as soon as the sermon is over, concerning those things which ought to
   make them weep always and constantly." Ah, dear friends, no warmth of
   eloquence can ever warn the stony heart of man into a glow of love to
   Jesus; nay, no force of entreaty can get so much as a spark of
   gratitude out of the flinty heart of man. Though your hearts renewed by
   grace should be like a flaming furnace, yet you cannot warm your
   neighbour's heart with the divine heat; he will think you a fool for
   being so enthusiastic; he will turn upon his heel and think you a
   madman to be so concerned about matters that seem so trivial to him:
   the warmth that is in your heart you cannot communicate to him, for he
   is not, while unconverted, capable of receiving it. The heart of man,
   like marble, is stone-cold.

   2. Then, again, like a stone, it is hard. You get the hard stone,
   especially some sorts of stone which have been hewn from granite-beds,
   and you may hammer as you will, but you shall make no impression. The
   heart of man is compared in Scripture to the nether millstone, and in
   another place it is even compared to the adamant stone; it is harder
   than the diamond; it cannot be cut; it cannot be broken; it cannot be
   moved. I have seen the great hammer of the law, which is ten times more
   ponderous than Nasmyth's great steam hammer, come down upon a man's
   heart, and the heart has never shown the slightest signs of shrinking.
   We have seen a hundred powerful shots sent against it, we have marked
   the great battery of the law with its ten great pieces of ordnance all
   fired against the heart of man, but man's heart has been harder even
   than the sheathing of the iron-clad ships, and the great shots of the
   law have dropped harmlessly against a man's conscience-- he did not, he
   would not feel. What razor-edged sentence can cut your hearts? What
   needle-warning can prick your consciences? Alas, all means are
   unavailing! No arguments have power to move a soul so steeled, so
   thoroughly stony, hard, and impenetrable. Some of you now present, have
   given more than enough evidence of the hardness of your hearts.
   Sickness has befallen you, death has come in at your windows,
   affliction has come up against you, but like Pharaoh, you have said,
   "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice? I will not bow my neck,
   neither will I do his will. I am my own master, and I will have my own
   pleasure and my own way. I will not yield to God." O rocks of iron and
   hills of brass, ye are softer than the proud heart of man!

   3. Again, a stone is dead. You can find no feeling in it. Talk to it;
   it will shed no tears of pity, though you recount to it the saddest
   tales; no smiles will gladden it, though you should tell it the most
   happy story. It is dead; there is no consciousness in it; prick it and
   it will not bleed; stab it and it cannot die, for it is dead already.
   You cannot make it wince, or start, or show any signs of sensibility.
   Now, though man's heart is not like this as to natural things, yet
   spiritually this is just its condition. You cannot make it show one
   spiritual emotion. "Ye are dead in trespasses and sins ," powerless,
   lifeless, without feeling, without emotion. Transient emotions towards
   good men have, even as the surface of a slab is wet after a shower, but
   real vital emotions of good they cannot know, for the showers of heaven
   reach not the interior of the stone. Melancthon may preach, but old
   Adam is too dead for him to quicken him. Ye may go down into the grave
   where the long sleep has fallen on humanity, and ye may seek to revive
   it, but there is no power in human tongue to revive the dead. Man is
   like the deaf adder which will not be charmed, charm we never so
   wisely. Tears are lost on him; threatenings are but as the whistlings
   of the wind, the preachings of the law, and even of Christ
   crucified--all these are null and void and fall hopelessly to the
   ground, so long as the man's heart continues what is by nature--dead,
   and hard, and cold.

   4. Those three adjectives might be sufficient to give a full
   description, for if we add two more we shall but in some degree repeat
   ourselves. Man's heart is like a stone because it is not easily to be
   softened. Lay a stone in water as long as you will and you shall not
   find it readly subdued. There are some sorts of stone that yield to the
   stress of weather, especially in the smoky atmosphere and the
   sulphurous vapours of London; certain stones crumble to decay, but the
   stone of a man's heart no climate can affect, no weathers can subdue;
   it grows harder whether it be the soft sunshine of love or the harsh
   tempest of judgment that falls upon it. Mercy and love alike make it
   more solid, and knit its particles closer together; and surely until
   the Omnipotent himself speak the word, the heart of man grows harder,
   and harder, and harder, and refuses to be broken. There is an
   invention, I believe, for liquifying flints, and then afterwards they
   may be poured out in a solution which is supposed to have the virtue of
   resisting the action of the atmosphere when put upon certain
   limestones; but you never can liquify, except by a divine power, the
   flinty heart of man. Granite may be ground, may be broken into pieces,
   but unless God gets the hammer in his hand, and even he must put both
   hands to it, the great granitic heart of man will not yield in any way.
   Certain stones have their veins, and certain crystallic stones may be
   so dexterously struck, that they will frequently break even with a
   slight blow; but you can never find a vein in man's heart by which the
   attempt to conquer it will be assisted from within. You may smite right
   and left with death, with judgment, with mercy, with privileges with
   tears, with entreaties, with threatenings, and it will not break; nay,
   even tthe fires of hell, do not melt man's heart, for the damned in
   hell grow more hard by their agonies, and they hate God, and blaspheme
   him all the more because of the suffering they endure. Only Omnipotence
   itself, I say, can ever soften this hard heart of man.

   5. So, then, man's heart is cold, and dead, and hard, and cannot be
   softened; and then, again--and this is but an enlargement of a former
   thought--it is utterly senseless, incapable of receiving impressions.
   Remember, again, I am not speaking of the heart of man physically, I am
   not speaking of it even as I would if I were teaching mental science;
   we are only now regarding it from a spiritual point of view. Men do
   receive mental impressions under the preaching of the Word; they often
   get so uneasy that they cannot shake off their thoughts; but alas!
   their goodness is as the early cloud, and as the morning dew, and it
   vanishes as a dream. But, spiritually, you can no more impress the
   heart of man than you might leave a bruise upon a stone. Wax receives
   an impression from a seal, but not the stern, unyielding stone; if you
   have hot running wax you may make what mark you please upon it, but
   when you have the cold, cold stone, though you bear never so hard upon
   the stamp, there is no impression, the surface shows no trace of your
   labour. So is man's heart by nature. I know some who say it is not so,
   they do not like to hear human nature slandered, so they say. Well,
   friend, if though hast not this hard heart, why is it thou art not
   saved? I remember an anecdote of Dr. Gill which hits this nail on the
   head. It is said that a man came to him in the vestry of his chapel and
   said, "Dr. Gill, you have been preaching the doctrine of human
   inability, I don't believe you. I believe that man can repent and can
   believe, and is not without spiritual power." "Well," said the doctor,
   "have you repented and believed?" "No," said the other. "Very well,
   then." said he, "you deserve double damnation." And so I say to the man
   who boats that he has not such a hard heart as this--have you laid hold
   of Christ? have you come to him? if you have not, then out of your own
   heart be you condemned, for you deserve double destruction from the
   presence of God, for having resisted the influences of God's Spirit and
   rejected his grace. I need not say more abut the hardness of the human
   heart, as that will come up incidentally by-and-bye, when we are
   speaking of the heart of flesh.

   But now, let us notice the danger to which this hard heart is exposed.
   A hard heart is exposed to the danger of final impenitence. If all
   these years the processes of nature have been at work with your heart,
   and have not softened it, have you not reason to conclude that it may
   be so even to the end? And then you will certainly perish. Many of you
   are no strangers to the means of grace. I speak to some of you who have
   been hearing the gospel preached ever since you were little ones: you
   went to the Sabbath school; mayhap, you were wont in your boy hood to
   listen to old Mr. So-and-so, who often brought tears to your eyes, and
   of late you have been here, and there have been times with this
   congregation when the word seemed enough to melt the very rocks and
   make the hard hearts of steel flow down in repentance, and yet you are
   still the same as ever. What does reason tell you to expect? Surely
   this should be the natural inference from the logic of facts you will
   continue as you are now, means will be useless to you, privileges will
   but become accumulated judgments, and you will go on till time is over,
   and eternity approaches, unblest, unsaved, and you will go down to the
   doom of the lost soul. "Oh!" saith one, "I hope not;" and I add, I hope
   not too; but I am solemnly afraid of it, especially with some of you.
   Some of you are growing old under the gospel, and you are getting so
   used to my voice that you could almost go to sleep under it. As Rowland
   Hill says of the blacksmith's dog, that at first he used to be afraid
   of the sparks, but afterwards got so used to it, that he could lie and
   sleep under the anvil; and there are some of you who can sleep under
   the anvil, with the sparks of God's wrath flying about your nostrils,
   asleep under the most solemn discourse. I do not mean with your eyes
   shut, for I might then point to you, but asleep in your hearts, your
   souls being given to slumber while your eyes may regard the preacher,
   and your ears may be listening to his voice.

   And further, there is another danger, hearts that are not softened grow
   harder and harder; what little sensibility they seemed to have, at last
   departs. Perhaps there are some of you that can recollect what you were
   when you were boys. There is a picture in the Royal Academy at this
   hour, which teaches a good moral: there is a mother putting her
   children to bed, the father happens to be in just when they are going
   to their slumbers; the little ones are kneeling down saying their
   prayers; there is only a curtain between them and the room where the
   father is, and he is sitting down; he is putting his hand to his head,
   and the tears are flowing very freely, for somehow he cannot stand it;
   he recollects when he too was taught to pray at his mother's knee, and
   though he has grown up forgetful of God and the things of God, he
   remembers the time when it was not so with him. Take care, my dear
   hearers, that you do not grow worse and worse; for it will be so; we
   either grow ripe or rotten, one of the two, as years pass over us.
   Which is it with you?

   Then further, a man who has a hard heart is Satan's throne. There is a
   stone they tell us, in Scotland, at Scone, where they were wont to
   crown their old kings: the stone on which they crown the old king of
   hell is a hard heart; it is his choicest throne; he reigns in hell, but
   he counts hard hearts to be his choicest dominions.

   Then again, the hard heart is ready for anything. When Satan sits upon
   it and makes it is throne, there is no wonder that from the seat of the
   scorner flow all manner of evil. And besides that, the hard heart is
   impervious to all instrumentality. John Bunyan, in his history of the
   "Holy War," represents old Diabolus, the devil, as providing for the
   people of Mansoul a coat of armour, of which the breastplate was a hard
   heart. Oh! that is a strong breastplate. Sometimes when we preach the
   gospel, we wonder that there is not more good done. I wonder that there
   is so much. When men sit in the house of God, armed up to their very
   chins in a coat of mail, it is not much wonder that the arrows do not
   pierce their hearts. If a man has an umbrella, it is no marvel if he
   does not get wet; and so when the showers of grace are falling, there
   are many of you who put up the umbrella of a hard heart, and it is no
   marvel if the dew of grace and the rain of grace do not drop into your
   souls. Hard hearts are the devil's life-guards. When he once gets a man
   in an armour of proof--that of a hard heart--"Now," says he, "you may
   go anywhere." So he sends them to hear the minister, and they make fun
   of him; he lets them read religious books, and they can find something
   to mock at there; he will then turn them even to the Bible, and with
   their hard heart they may read the Bible pretty safely, for even the
   Word of God the hard heart can turn to mischief, and find something to
   find fault with even in the person of Christ, and in the glorious
   attributes of God himself. I shall not stay longer upon this very
   painful subject; but if you feel that your hearts are hard, may your
   prayer go up to God, "Lord, melt my heart. None but a bath of blood
   divine can take the flint away; but do it Lord, and thou shalt have the
   praise."

   II. Secondly, and briefly, A HEART OF FLESH AND ITS PRIVILEGES. "I will
   take away the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh." In
   many--very many who are present to-night my text has been fulfilled.
   Let us join in praying for others whose hearts are still stony, that
   God would work this miracle in them, and turn their hearts to flesh.

   What is meant by a heart of flesh? I means a heart that can feel on
   account of sin--a heart that can bleed when the arrows of God stick
   fast in it; it means a heart that can yield when the gospel makes its
   attacks--a heart that can be impressed when the seal of God's word
   comes upon it; it means a heart that is warm, for life is warm--a heart
   that can think, a heart that can aspire, a heart that can love--putting
   all in one--a heart of flesh means that new heart and right spirit
   which God giveth to the regenerate. But wherein does this heart of
   flesh consist; wherein does its tenderness consist? Well, its
   tenderness consists in three things. There is a tenderness of
   conscience. Men who have lost their stony hearts are afraid of sin,
   even before sin they are afraid of it. The very shadow of evil across
   their path frightens them. The temptation is enough for them, they flee
   from it as from a serpent; they would not dally and toy with it, lest
   they should be betrayed. Their conscience is alarmed even at the
   approach of evil, and away they fly; and in sin, for even tender hearts
   do sin, they are uneasy.; As well might a man seek to obtain quiet rest
   on a pillow stuffed with thorns, as the tender conscience get any peace
   while a man in sinning. And then, after sin--here comes the pinch--the
   heart of flesh bleeds as though it were wounded to its very core. It
   hates and loathes and detests itself that ever it should have gone
   astray. Ah, stony heart, you can think of sin with pleasure, you can
   live in sin and not care about it; and after sin you can roll the sweet
   morsel under your tongue and say, "Who is my master? I care for none;
   my conscience does not accuse me." But not so the tender broken heart.
   Before sin, and in sin, and after sin, it smarts and cries out to God.
   So also in duty as well as in sin, the new heart is tender. Hard hearts
   care nothing for God's commandment; hearts of flesh wish to be obedient
   to every statute. "Only let me know my Master's will and I will do it."
   The hearts of flesh when they feel that the commandment has been
   omitted, or that the command has been broken, mourn and lament before
   God. Oh! there are some hearts of flesh that cannot forgive themselves,
   if they have been lax in prayer, if they have not enjoyed the
   Sabbath-day, if they feel that they have not given their hearts to
   God's praise as they should. These duties which hearts of stone trifle
   with and despise, hearts of flesh value and esteem. If the heart of
   flesh could have its way, it would never sin, it would be as perfect as
   its Father who is in heaven, and it would keep God's command without
   flaw of omission or of commission. Have you, dear friends, such a heart
   of flesh as this?

   I believe a heart of flesh, again, is tender, not only with regard to
   sin and duty, but with regard to suffering. A heart of stone can hear
   God blasphemed and laugh at it; but our blood runs cold to hear God
   dishonoured when we have a heart of flesh. A heart of stone can bear to
   see its fellow creatures perish and despise their destruction; but the
   heart of flesh is very tender over others. "Faith its pity would
   reclaim, and snatch the firebrand from the flame." A heart of flesh
   would give its very life-blood if it might but snatch others from going
   down to the pit, for its bowels yearn and its soul moves toward its
   fellow sinners who are on the broad road to destruction. Have you, oh,
   have you such a heart of flesh as this?

   Then to put it in another light, the heart of flesh is tender in three
   ways. It is tender in conscience. Hearts of stone make no bones, as we
   say, about great mischiefs; but hearts of flesh repent even at the very
   thought of sin. To have indulged a foul imagination, to have flattered
   a lustful thought, and to have allowed it to tarry even for a minute is
   quite enough to make a heart of flesh grieved and rent before God with
   pain. The heart of stone says, when it has done great iniquity, "Oh, it
   is nothing, it is nothing! Who am I that I should be afraid of God's
   law?" But not so the heart of flesh. Great sins are little to the stony
   heart, little sins are great to the heart of flesh--if little sins
   there be. Conscience in the heart of stone is seared as with a hot
   iron; conscience in the heart of flesh is raw and very tender; like the
   sensitive plant, it coils up it's leaves at the slightest touch, it
   cannot bear the presence of evil; it is like a delicate consumptive,
   who feels every wind and is affected by every change of atmosphere. God
   give us such a blessedly tender conscience as that. Then again, the
   heart of flesh grows tender of God's will. My Lord Will-be-will is a
   great blusterer, and it is hard to bring him down to subject himself to
   God's will. When you have a man's conscience on God's side, you have
   only half the battle if you cannot get his will. The old maxim--

   "Convince a man against his will

   He's of the same opinion still."

   is true with regard to this as well as regard to anything else. Oh!
   there are some of you that know the right, but you will do the wrong.
   You know what is evil, but you will to pursue it. Now, when the heart
   of flesh is given, the will bends like a willow, quivers like an aspen
   leaf in every breath of heaven, and bows like an osier in every breeze
   of God's Spirit. The natural will is stern and stubborn, and you must
   rend it up by the roots; but the renewed will is gentle and pliable,
   feels the divine influence, and sweetly yields to it. To complete the
   picture, in the tender heart there is a tenderness of the affections.
   The hard heart does not love God, but the renewed heart does. The hard
   heart is selfish, cold, stolid. "Why should I weep for sin? Why should
   I love the Lord? Why should I give my heart to Christ?" The heart of
   flesh says--

   "Thou know'st I love thee, dearest Lord,

   But oh! I long to soar

   Far from this world of sin and woe,

   And learn to love thee more."

   O may God give us a tenderness of affection, that we may love God with
   all our heart, and our neighbour as ourselves.

   Now, the privileges of this renewed heart are these. "'Tis here the
   Spirit dwells, 'tis here that Jesus rests." The soft heart is ready now
   to receive every spiritual blessing. It is fitted to yield every
   heavenly fruit to the honour and praise of God. Oh! if we had none but
   tender hearts to preach to, what blessed work our ministry would be.
   What happy success! What sowings on earth! What harvests in heaven! We
   may indeed pray that God may work this change if it were only that our
   ministry might be more often a saviour of life unto life, and not of
   death unto death. A soft heart is the best defence against sin, while
   it is the best preparative for heaven. A tender heart is the best means
   of watchfulness against evil, while it is also the best means of
   preparing us for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall shortly
   descend from heaven.

   Now, my voice fails me, and in your hearts I certainly shall not be
   heard for my much speaking. Great complaints have been brought against
   somebody's sermons for being too long, though I hardly think they could
   have been mine. So let us be brief, and let us conclude; only we must
   press this enquiry home--Has God taken away the heart of stone and has
   he given you the heart of flesh. Dear friend, you cannot change your
   own heart. Your outward works will not change it; you may rub as long
   as ever you like outside of a bottle, but you could not turn
   ditch-water into wine; you may polish the exterior of your lanthorn,
   but it will not give you light until the candle burns within. The
   gardener may prune a crab tree, but all the pruning in the world won't
   into an apricot; so you may attend to all the moralities in the world,
   but these won't change your heart. Polish your shilling, but it will
   not change into gold; nor will your heart alter its own nature. What,
   then, is to be done? Christ is the great heart changer. "Believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be be saved." The Holy Spirit gives
   faith, and then through faith the mature is renewed. What sayest thou,
   sinner? Dost thou believe that Christ is able to save thee? Oh, trust
   him then to save thee, and if thou doest that thou art saved; thy
   nature is renewed, and the work of sanctification which shall begin
   to-night, shall go on until it shall come to its perfection, and thou,
   borne on angel's wings to heaven, "glad the summons to obey," shalt
   enter into felicity and holiness, and be redeemed with the saints in
   white, made spotless through the righteousness of Jesus Christ.

                              Religion--a Reality

   A Sermon

   (No. 457)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, June 22nd, 1862, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "For it is not a vain thing for you, because it is your
   life."--Deuteronomy 32:47.

   IT APPEARS from this closing remark of Moses, that there were men in
   his time who thought religion to be vain, although, under the system
   which then existed, there were many plain proofs of its usefulness: for
   they who served God in those days prospered, and national advantages
   always followed nation obedience to God. Under the theocratic
   government of the Israelites in the wilderness, and in their early
   history when established in Canaan, their offences against God's law
   brought upon them famine, plague, or the scourge of marauding hosts;
   while repentance and a return to allegiance always brought them a
   deliverer, and a restoration of peace and plenty. They had visibly
   before their eyes proofs that God did reward virtue; and yet,
   notwithstanding this, there were some so besotted against God, that
   they said, "It is a vain thing to serve the Lord." Do you wonder,
   therefore, that there should be many such under the gospel? It would,
   indeed, be marvellous if there were not many more, for the gospel is a
   far more spiritual system than the Jewish dispensation, and its
   blessings are not of a carnal order. No blessing apparent to carnal
   eyes rests upon the godly, but sometimes the case appears to be
   reversed: we see the wicked prosper, and the righteous are trodden
   under foot. The Christian dispensation is one which requires much faith
   to receive it. We walk not by sight, but by faith alone; and it is
   little marvel that when ungodly men see the righteous afflicted, and
   discover that their comfort lies in matters which only faith can
   apprehend, they should cry out, "It is a vain thing," and should turn
   aside from the ordinances of God. Besides, to confess the truth, there
   have been so many counterfeits of true religion, that it is not
   remarkable that unconverted men should consider even the genuine
   article to be but a vain thing. Men have made pretences of wondrous
   sanctity, whilst inwardly full of rottenness; and sinners have learned
   to argue with terrible logic: "They are none of them good; they are all
   deceivers; the best of them are hypocrites, and religion itself is a
   vain thing." However false may be the conclusion here--and we believe
   it to be utterly so--yet we do not wonder that men, desiring to believe
   religion to be a falsehood, have found some support for their unbelief
   in the hypocrisy of professors.

   Now we will grant you this morning that much of the religion which is
   abroad in the world is a vain thing. The religion of ceremonies is
   vain. If a man shall trust in the gorgeous pomp of uncommanded
   mysteries, if he shall consider that there resides some mystic efficacy
   in a priest, and that by uttering certain words a blessing is
   infallibly received, we tell him that his religion is a vain thing. You
   might as well go to the Witch of Endor for grace as to a priest; and if
   you rely upon words, the "Abracadabra" of a magician will as certainly
   raise you to heaven, or rather sink you to hell, as the performances of
   the best ordained minister under heaven. Ceremonies in themselves are
   vain, futile, empty. There are but two of God's ordaining, they are
   most simple, and neither of them pretend to have any efficacy in
   themselves. They only set forth an inward and spiritual grace, not
   necessarily tied to them, but only given to those who by faith perceive
   their teachings. All ceremonial religion, no matter how sincere, if it
   consist in relying upon forms and observances, is a vain thing. So with
   creed-religion--by which I mean not to speak against creeds, for I love
   "the form of sound words," but that religion which lies in believing
   with the intellect a set of dogmas, without partaking of the life of
   God; all this is a vain thing. Again, that religion which only lies in
   making a profession of what one does not posses, in wearing the
   Christian name, and observing the ritual of the Church, but which does
   not so affect the character as to make a man holy, nor so touch the
   heart as to make a man God's true servant--such a religion is vain
   throughout. O my dear hearers, how much worthless religion may you see
   everywhere! So long as men get the name, they seem content without the
   substance. Everywhere, it matters not to what Church you turn your eye,
   you see a vast host of hypocrites, numerous as flies about a dead
   carcase. On all sides there are deceivers, and deceived; who write
   "Heaven" upon their brows, but have hell in their hearts; who hang out
   the sign of an angel over their doors, but have the devil for a host
   within. Take heed to yourselves; be not deceived, for he who tries the
   heart and searches the reins of the children of men is not mocked, and
   he will surely discern between him that feareth God, and him that
   feareth him not.

   But with all these allowances, we still this morning assert most
   positively that the religion of Christ Jesus, that which has been
   revealed to us of the Holy Ghost by the apostles and prophets, and
   specially by the Messiah himself, when truly received into the heart,
   is no vain thing. We shall handle the text four ways, taking the word
   "vain" in different shades of meaning. It is no fiction it is no
   trifle; it is no folly; it is no speculation. In each case we will
   prove our assertion by the second sentence--"Because it is your life."

   I. First, then, the true religion of Christ, which consists in a vital
   faith in his person, his blood, and his righteousness, and which
   produces obedience to his commands, and a love to God, IS NOT A
   FICTION.

   I am not going to argue this morning. I was never sent to argue, but to
   teach and speak dogmatically. I assert in the name of all those who
   have tried it, that true religion is not a fiction to us. It is to us
   the grandest of all realities, and we hope that our testimony and
   witness, if we be honest men, may prevail with others who may be
   sceptical upon this point. We say, then, that the objects of true
   religion are, to those who believe in Jesus, no fiction. God the Father
   to whom we look with the spirit of adoption, is no fiction to us. I
   know that to some men the Divine Being is a mere abstraction. As to
   communing with him, as to speaking to him, they think such wonders may
   have occurred to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, but to them such
   things are impossible. Now we do solemnly assure you, as men who would
   not lie in this matter, that God the Father is to us as real a person
   as the man from whose loins we sprang, and that we have as surely
   talked unto him, and he has as truly spoken to our hearts as ever we
   have spoken with our friend, and have been answered by him. We tell you
   that to us the being of God is a fact which influences our whole life,
   checks us when we would sin, forbids our weaker passions to rebel, and
   nerves our nobler powers to do or suffer. Our consciousness, our
   experience, our emotions, and our whole being, tell us that there is a
   God. We have had personal dealings with him; he has been with us in our
   chamber; we have seen his face in the sanctuary; we have cast our cares
   upon him; and therefore to us the Eternal and indwelling Father is no
   fiction. So is it with Christ Jesus. To mere professors Christ Jesus is
   never anything but a myth. They believe there was such a man, but he is
   only an historical personage to them. To true believers in Christ,
   however, he is a real person, now existing, and now dwelling in the
   hearts of his people. And oh! I bear my witness that if there be
   anything which has ever been certified to my consciousness it is the
   existence of Jesus, the man, the Son of God. Oh friends, have we not,
   when our soul has been in a rapture, thrust our finger into the prints
   of the nails? Have we not been so drawn away from the outward world,
   that in spiritual communings we could say, He was to us as our brother
   that sucked the breasts of our mother, and when we found him without we
   did embrace him, and we would not let him go? His left hand has been
   under our head, and his right hand has embraced us. I know this will
   sound like a legend even to men who profess to be Christ's followers,
   but I question the reality of your piety if Christ be not one for whom
   you live, and in whom you dwell; with whom you walk, and in whom you
   hope soon to sleep that you may wake up in his likeness. A real Christ
   and a real God--no man has real religion till he knows these. So again
   the Holy Spirit, who is, with the Father and the Son, the one God of
   Israel; the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, indivisibly One and
   yet everlastingly Three--the Holy Spirit is also real, for

   "He, in our hearts of sin and woe

   Makes living streams of grace arise,

   Which into boundless glory flow."

   Tell us there is no Spirit? Why, about this we can speak positively. A
   fool may say that there is no magnetic influence, and that no electric
   streams can flow along the wires, but they who have once been touched
   by that mysterious power know it; and the Holy Spirit's influence on
   men is quite as much within the sphere of our recognition, if we have
   ever felt it, as is the influence of galvanism or magnetism. Those who
   have once felt the spiritual life know when it is flowing in; when its
   strength is withdrawn, and when it returns anew. They know that at
   times they can do all things; their heaviest trial is a joy, and their
   weightiest burden a delight; and that at other times they can do
   nothing, being bowed down to the very dust with weakness. They know
   that at times they enjoy peace with God through Jesus Christ, and that
   at other times they are disturbed in spirit. They have discovered, too,
   that these changes do not depend upon the weather, nor upon
   circumstances, nor upon any relation of one thought to another, but
   upon certain secret, mystic, and divine impulses which come forth from
   the Spirit of God, which make a man more than man, for he is filled
   with Deity from head to foot, and whose withdrawal makes him feel
   himself less than man, for he is filled with sin and drenched with
   iniquity, till he loatheth his own being. Tell us there is no Holy
   Spirit! We have seen his goings in the sanctuary, but as we shall have
   to mention these by-and-bye, we pass on, and only now affirm that the
   Father, Son, and Spirit, are to true Christians no fiction, no dream,
   no fancy, but as real and as true as persons whom we can see, things
   which we can handle, or viands which we can taste.

   But further, we can also say that the experience which true religion
   brings is no fiction. Believe me, sirs, it is no fiction to repent; for
   there is a bitterness in it which makes it all too real. Oh, the agony
   of sin lying on an awakened conscience! If you have ever felt it, it
   will seem to you as the ravings of a madman when any shall tell you
   that religion is not real! When the great hammer of the law broke our
   hearts in pieces, it was a stern reality. These eyes have sometimes,
   before I knew the Saviour, been ready to start from my head with
   horror, and my soul has often been bowed down with a grief far too
   terrible ever to be told to my fellow-man, when I felt that I was
   guilty before God, that my Maker was angry with me, that he must punish
   me, and that I deserved and must suffer his eternal wrath. I do assure
   you there was no fiction there! And when the Spirit of God comes into
   the heart and takes all our grief away, and gives us joy and peace in
   believing in Christ, there is no fiction then. Of course, to other men
   this is no evidence, except they will believe our honesty; but to us it
   is the very best of evidence. We were bidden to believe on Christ; it
   was all we were to do: to look to his cross, to believe him to be the
   propitiation for sin, and to trust in him to save us; we did so, and
   oh, the joy of that moment! In one instant we leaped from the depths of
   hell to the very heights of heaven in experience; dragged up out of the
   horrible pit, and out of the miry clay, our feet were set upon a rock,
   and we could sing for very joy. Oh, the mirth! oh, the bliss! oh, the
   ecstacy of the soul that can say--

   "Happy, happy, happy day,

   When Jesus washed my sins away,

   Happy, happy, happy day."

   That was no fiction, surely. If it be so, I will continue to cry,
   "Blessed fiction! blessed dream! may I contrive to believe thee; may I
   always be so deluded if this is to be deluded and misled!" Since then,
   look at the believer's experience. He has had as many troubles as other
   men have, but oh, what comforts he has had! He lost his wife, and as he
   stood there and thought his heart would break, he could still say, "The
   Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the
   Lord." Child after child sickened before his loving gaze, and as they
   went one after the other to the tomb where he often wished he could
   have slept instead of them--while he mourned and wept as Jesus did, yet
   still he could say, "Though he slay me yet will I trust in him." When
   the house was burned--when the property vanished--when trade ran
   ill--when character was slandered--when the soul was desponding and all
   but despairing, yet there came in that one ray of light, "Christ is
   all, and all things work together for good to them that love God, to
   them that are called according to his purpose." I can tell you, that
   Christians have often had their brightest days when other people
   thought they were in their darkest nights; and they have often had the
   best of dainties when there was a famine abroad. Is this a fiction? O
   sirs, we challenge you to find so blessed a fiction as this elsewhere!
   I saw last Friday a sight, enough to make one weep indeed: there in the
   back-room of the house, lay a fine youth, a member of this Church,
   sickening and near to death of consumption, and he talked to me
   joyously of his prospect of entering into the rest which remaineth for
   the people of God; there in the front-room, on the same floor, lay his
   sister, I suppose but some two years younger, withering under the same
   disease; and there sat the tender mother with her two children,
   thinking to lose them both within a few days, and though she said, it
   was natural to weep, yet she could say even under this sharp trial,
   "The Lord's name be magnified in it all." I say there was no fiction
   there. If you who think there is a fiction in such things could live
   among Christians--if you could see the poor cheerfully suffering --if
   you could mark the sick and how joyously they bear their pains-if you
   could see the dying and hear their shouts of triumph, you would say,
   "There is a reality here; there is something in true religion; let me
   die the death of the righteous; let my last end be like his!"

   But yet further; as we are sure there is a reality in the objects and
   in the experience of true godliness, so are we quite clear that there
   is a reality in its privileges. One of the privileges of the Christian
   is prayer. It is the believer's privilege, to go to God an ask for what
   he wants, and have it. Now, sirs, I am absolutely certain that prayer
   is a reality. I shall not tell here my own experience. One reads not
   his love-letters in the streets, one tells not his own personal
   dealings with God in public; but if there be a fact that can be proved
   by ten thousand instances, and which therefore no reasonable man has
   any right to doubt --if there be anything that is true under heaven, it
   is true that God hears prayer when it cometh not out of feigned lips,
   and is offered through Jesus Christ. I know when we tell the story out,
   men smile and say, "Ah, these were singular coincidences!" Why, I have
   seen in my life, answers to prayer so remarkable, that if God had rent
   the curtain of the heavens and thrust out his arm to work a
   deliverance, it could not have been more decidedly and distinctly a
   divine interposition than when he listened to my feeble cry for help. I
   speak not of myself as though I were different from other men in this,
   for it is so with all who have real godliness. They know that God hears
   them; they prove it to-day; they intend to prove it at this very hour.

   Communion with Christ is another reality. The shadow of his cross is
   too refreshing to be a dream, and the sunlight of his face is too
   bright to be a delusion. Precious Jesus! thou art a storehouse of
   substantial delights and solid joy. Then, the privileges of Christian
   Love towards one another are real. I know they are not with some men.
   Why, look you at some of your fashionable Churches; if the poor people
   were to speak to the richer ones, what would the rich ones think of
   them? Why, snap their heads half off, and send them about their
   business! But where there is true Christianity, we feel that the only
   place in the world where there can ever be liberty, equality, and
   fraternity, is in the Church of Christ. To attempt this politically, is
   but to attempt an impossibility; but to foster it in the Church of God,
   where we are all allied to God, is but to nourish the very spirit of
   the gospel. I say there is a reality in Christian love, for I have seen
   it among my flock; and though some do not show it as they should, yet
   my heart rejoices that there is so much hearty brotherly love among
   you, and thus your religion is not a vain thing.

   Once more upon this point, for I am spending all my time here while I
   need it for other points. The religion of Christ is evidently not a
   vain thing if you look at its effects. We will not take you abroad now
   to tell you of the effects of the gospel of Christ in the South Sea. We
   need not remind you of what it has done for the heathen, but let me
   tell you what it has done for men here. Ah! brethren, you will not mind
   my telling out some of the secrets, secrets that bring the tears to my
   eyes as I reflect upon them. When I speak of the thief, the harlot, the
   drunkard, the sabbath-breaker, the swearer, I may say "Such were some
   of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye rejoice in the
   name of our Lord Jesus Christ." How many a man has been going by the
   door there, and has said "I'll go in and hear Old Spurgeon." He came in
   to make merriment of the preacher, and very little that troubles him.
   But the man has stood there until the Word has gone home to him, and he
   who was wont to beat his wife, and to make his home a hell, has before
   long been to see me, and given me a grip of the hand and said, "God
   Almighty bless you, sir; there is something in true religion!" "Well,
   let us hear your tale," We have heard it, and delightful it has been in
   hundreds of instances. "Very well, send your wife, and let us hear what
   she says about you." The woman has come, and we have said "Well, what
   think you of your husband now, ma'am?" "Oh, sir, such a change I never
   saw in my life! He is so kind to us; he is like an angel now, and he
   seemed like a fiend before; Oh! that cursed drink, sir! everything went
   to the public-house; and then if I went up to the house of God, he did
   nothing but abuse me. Oh! to think that now he comes with me on Sunday;
   and the shop is shut up, sir; and the children who used to be running
   about without a bit of shoe or stocking, he takes them on his knee, and
   prays with them so sweetly. Oh! there is such a change!" Surly people
   say "Will it last? Will it last?" Well, I have seen it last the eight
   years of my pastorate, in many cases, and I know it will last for ever,
   for I am persuaded that it is God's work. We will put it to all the
   Social Science Societies; we will put it to all the different religions
   under heaven, whether they know the art of turning sinners into saints;
   whether they can make lions into lambs, and ravens into doves. Why I
   know a man who was as stingy a soul as could be, once, and now he is as
   generous a man as walks God's earth. There is another, he was not
   immoral, but he was passionate, and now he is as quiet as a lamb. It is
   grace that has altered these characters, and yet you tell me that this
   is a fiction! I have not patience to answer you. A fiction! If religion
   does not prove itself to be true by these facts, then do not believe
   it; if it does not, when it comes into a neighborhood, turn it upside
   down, sweep the cobwebs out of its sky, clean the houses, take the men
   out of the public-houses; if it does not make swearers pray, and
   hard-hearted men tender and compassionate, then it is not worth a
   button. But our religion does do all this, and therefore we boldly say,
   it is not a vain thing.

   Besides, to the man who really possesses it, it is his life. He is not
   a man and a Christian, but he is all a Christian. He is not as some
   are, men and Members of Parliament, who have many things to attend to,
   and attend Parliament also; but the man who is thoroughly a Christian
   is a Christian every bit of him. He lives Christianity; he eats it; he
   drinks it; he sleeps it; he walks it. Wherever you see him, he has his
   religion. His religion is not like a man's regimentals which he can
   take off an go in undress; it is inside of him; it is woven right
   through and through him. When the shuttle of his religion was thrown,
   it went right through the core of his heart, and you must kill that man
   to get his religion out of him. Racks may tear his nerves and sinews,
   but they cannot tear away his hope, for it is essentially and vitally
   part and parcel of himself. Ah! my ladies and gentlemen, you who think
   religion is no more real than the life of a butterfly, it is you who
   are unreal in your fancies, and your follies; religion is the
   substance, and your life is only the shadow! Oh! you workingmen, who
   think that to be godly is but to indulge a dream, you know not what you
   say. All else is fiction but this; all else is but a moon-beam phantom,
   but this is sun-lit reality. God give you grace to get it, and then you
   will feel we have not spoken too strongly, but rather have spoken too
   little of that which is essentially and really true.

   II. Secondly, "It is not a vain thing"--that is, IT IS NO TRIFLE.

   If religion be false, it is the basest imposition under heaven; but if
   the religion of Christ be true, it is the most solemn truth that ever
   was known! It is not a thing that a man dares to trifle with if it be
   true, for it is at his soul's peril to make a jest of it. If it be not
   true it is detestable, but if it be true it deserves all a man's
   faculties to consider it, and all his powers to obey it. It is not a
   trifle. Briefly consider why it is not. It deals with your soul. If it
   dealt with your body it were no trifle, for it is well to have the
   limbs of the body sound, but it has to do with your soul. As much as a
   man is better than the garments that he wears, so much is the soul
   better than the body. It is your immortal soul it deals with. Your soul
   has to live for ever, and the religion of Christ deals with its
   destiny. Can you laugh at such words as heaven and hell, at glory and
   at damnation? If you can, if you think these trifles, then is the faith
   of Christ to be trifled with. Consider also with whom it connects
   you--with God; before whom angels bow themselves and veil their faces.
   Is HE to be trifled with? Trifle with your monarch if you will, but not
   with the King of kings, the Lord of lords. Recollect that those who
   have ever known anything of it tell you it is no child's play. The
   saints will tell you it is no trifle to be converted. They will never
   forget the pangs of conviction, nor the joys of faith. They tell you it
   is no trifle to have religion, for it carries them through all their
   conflicts, bears them up under all distresses, cheers them under every
   gloom, and sustains them in all labour. They find it no mockery. The
   Christian life to them is something so solemn, that when they think of
   it they fall down before God, and say, "Hold thou me up and I shall be
   safe." And sinners, too, when they are in their senses, find it no
   trifle. When they come to die they find it no little thing to die
   without Christ. When conscience gets the grip of them, and shakes them,
   they find it no small thing to be without a hope of pardon--with guilt
   upon the conscience, and no means of getting rid of it. And, sirs, true
   ministers of God feel it to be no trifle. I do myself feel it to be
   such an awful thing to preach God's gospel, that if it were not "Woe
   unto me if I do not preach the gospel," I would resign my charge this
   moment. I would not for the proudest consideration under heaven know
   the agony of mind I felt but this one morning before I ventured upon
   this platform! Nothing but the hope of winning souls from death and
   hell, and a stern conviction that we have to deal with the grandest of
   all realities, would bring me here.

   A pastor's office is no sinecure. A man that has the destinies of a
   kingdom under his control, may well feel his responsibility; but he who
   has the destiny of souls laid instrumentally at his door, must travail
   in birth, and know a mother's pangs; he must strive with God, and know
   an agony and yet a joy which no other man can meddle with. It is no
   trifle to us, we do assure you; oh! make it no trifle to yourselves. I
   know I speak to some triflers this morning, and perhaps to some
   trifling professors. Oh! professors, do not live so as to make
   worldlings think that your religion is a trifling thing! Be cheerful,
   but oh! be holy! Be happy, for that is your privilege; but oh! he
   heavenly-minded, for that is your duty. Let men see that you are not
   flirting with Christ, but that you are married to him. Let them see
   that you are not dabbling in this as in a little speculation, but that
   it is the business of your life, the stern business of all your powers
   to live to Christ, Christ also living in you.

   III. But next, and very briefly, for time will fly; the religion of
   Christ is no vain thing--that is, IT IS NO FOLLY.

   Thinking men! Yes, by the way, we have had thinking men who have been
   able to think in so circuitous a manner that they have thought it
   consistent with their consciences to profess to hold the doctrines of
   the Church of England, and to be Romanists or infidels! God deliver us
   from ever being able to think in their way! I always dislike the
   presence of man who carries a gun with him which will discharge shot in
   a circle. Surely he is a very ill companion, and if he should turn your
   enemy how are you to escape from him? Give me a straightforward,
   downright man, who says what he means, and means what he says, and I
   would sooner have the grossest reprobate who will speak plainly what he
   means, than I would have the most dandy of gentlemen who would not hurt
   your feelings, but who will profess to believe as you do, while in his
   heart he rejects every sentiment, and abhors every thought which you
   entertain. I trust I do not speak to any persons here who can think so
   circuitously as this. Still, you say, "Well, but the religion of
   Christ, why, you see, it is the poor that receive it." Bless God it is!
   "Well, but not many thinking people receive it." Now that is not true,
   but at the same time, if they did not we would not particularly mind,
   because all thinking people do not think aright, and very many of them
   think very wrongly indeed; but such a man as Newton could think and yet
   receive the gospel, and master-minds, whom it is not mine just now to
   mention, have bowed down before the sublimity of the simple revelation
   of Christ, and have felt it to be their honour to lay their wealth of
   intellect at the feet of Christ. But, sirs, where is the folly of true
   religion! Is it a folly to be providing for the world to come? "Oh,
   no." Is it altogether a folly to believe that there is such a thing as
   justice? I trow not. And that if there be such a thing as justice it
   involves punishment? There is no great folly there. Well, then, is it
   any folly to perceive that there is no way of escaping from the effects
   of our offences except justice be satisfied? Is that folly? And if it
   be the fact that Christ has satisfied justice for all who trust in him,
   is it folly to trust him? If it be a folly to escape from the flames of
   hell, then let us be fools. If it be folly to lay hold of him who
   giveth us eternal life--oh, blessed folly! let us be more foolish
   still. Let us take deep dives into the depths of this foolishness. God
   forbid that we should do anything else but glory in being such fools as
   this for Christ's sake! What, sirs, is your wisdom? your wisdom dwells
   in denying what your eyes can see--a God; in denying what your
   consciences tell you--that you are guilty; in denying what should be
   your best hope, what your spirit really craves after-redemption in
   Christ Jesus. Your folly lies in following a perverted nature, instead
   of obeying the dictates of one who points you to the right path. You
   are wise and you drink poison; we are fools and we take the antidote.
   You are wise and you hunt the shadow; we are fools and we grasp the
   substance. You are wise, and you labour and put your money into a bag
   which is full of holes, and spend it for that which is not bread, and
   which never gives you satisfaction; and we are fools enough to be
   satisfied, to be happy, to be perfectly content with heaven and God--

   "I would not change my bless'd estate

   For all the world calls good or great;

   And while my faith can keep her hold,

   I envy not the sinner's gold."

   Blessed folly! Oh, blessed folly! But it is not a foolish thing; for it
   is your life. Ah, sirs, if you would have philosophy it is in Christ.
   If you would accomplish the proudest feat of human intellect, it is to
   attain to the knowledge of Christ crucified. Here the man whose mind
   makes him elephantine, may find depths in which he may swim. Here the
   most recondite learning shall find itself exhausted. Here the most
   brilliant imagination shall find its highest flights exceeded. Here the
   critic shall have enough to criticise throughout eternity; here the
   reviewer may review, and review again, and never cease. Here the man
   who understands history may crown his knowledge by the history of God
   in the world; here men who would know the secret, the greatest secret
   which heaven, and earth, and hell can tell, may find it out, for the
   secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will show them
   his covenant. All the learning of man is doubtless folly to the angels,
   but the foolishness of God in the gospel is wisdom to cherubim and
   seraphim, and by the Church shall be made known to them in ages to come
   the manifold wisdom of God.

   IV. And now for the last point, hurriedly again: "It is not a vain
   thing,"--that is, IT IS NO SPECULATION, no hap-hazard.

   People sometimes ask us what we think about the heathen, whether they
   will be saved or not. Well, sirs, there is room for difference of
   opinion there; but I should like to know what you think about
   yourselves--will you be saved or not?--for after all that is a question
   of a deal more importance to you. Now the religion of Christ is not a
   thing that puts a man into a salvable state, but it saves him. It is
   not a religion which offers him something which perhaps may save him;
   no it saves him out and out, on the spot. It is not a thing which says
   to a man "Now I have set you a-going, you must keep on yourself." No,
   it goes the whole way through, and saves him from beginning to end. He
   that says "Alpha" never stops till he can say "Omega" over every soul.
   I say the religion of Christ: I know there are certain shadows of it
   which do not carry such a reality as this with them, but I say that the
   religion of the Bible, the religion of Jesus Christ, is an absolute
   certainty. "Whosoever believeth on him hath eternal life, and he shall
   never perish, neither shall he come into condemnation." "I give unto my
   sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any
   pluck them out of my hand." "There is therefore now no condemnation to
   them which are in Christ Jesus." "Well," says one, "I should like to
   know what this very sure religion is." Well, it is this--"Believe on
   the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." Trust Christ with all
   that you have and you shall be saved. "Well," says one, "but when?"
   Why, now, here, this morning, on the spot: you shall be saved now. It
   is not a vain thing; it is not a speculation, for it is true to you
   now. The word is nigh thee; on thy lip and in thy heart. If thou wilt
   with thy heart believe on the Lord Jesus Christ thou shalt be saved,
   and saved now. "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which
   are Christ Jesus." This is a great and glorious truth, and it is true
   to-day--"Whosoever believeth in him hath everlasting life." "But is it
   true to me?" saith one. My text says "It is not a vain thing for you."
   "Oh, it will suit other people; it will not do for me." It will suit
   you, sir--"It is not a vain thing for you because it is your life." If
   you have come up from the country, it is no vain thing for you, my dear
   friends; if you reside in town, amidst its noise and occupations, it is
   not a vain thing for you, my dear hearers. It is not a vain thing for
   any; if you do but lay hold of it, and it lays hold of you--if you
   receive the reality and vitality of it into your soul, be you who you
   may, it will not be a vain thing to you; not a "perhaps" and an "if," a
   "but" and a "peradventure," but a "shall" and a "will," a divine, an
   eternal, an everlasting and immutable certainty. Whosoever believeth in
   Christ--let the earth shake; let the mountains rock; let the sun grow
   old with age, and the moon quench her light--shall be saved. Unless God
   can change his mind--and that is impossible; unless God can break his
   word--and to say so is blasphemy; unless Christ's blood can lose its
   efficacy--and that can never be; unless the Spirit can be anything but
   Eternal and Omnipotent--and to suppose so were ridiculous--he that
   believeth on Christ, must at last, before the eternal throne, sing
   hallelujah to God and the Lamb. "Well," says one. " 'tis a vain thing,
   I'm sure, to me, for I'm only a poor working-man; religion no doubt, is
   a very fine thing for gentlefolk, but it doesn't do for a man as has to
   work hard, for he's something else to think on." Well, you are just the
   man that I should think it would do for. Why, it is little enough you
   have here, my dear friend, and that is the very reason why you should
   have eternal joys hereafter. If there be one man that religion can
   bless more than another--and I do not know that there is--it is the
   poor man in his humble cot. Why, this will put sweets into your cup;
   this will make your little into enough, and sometimes into more than
   enough; you shall be rich while you are poor, and happy when others
   think you are miserable. "Well," says the rich man, "It is nothing to
   me; I do not see that it will suit me." Why, it is the very thing for
   you, sir; in fact, you are the man who ought to have it, because, see
   what you have to lose when you die, unless you have religion to make up
   for it! What a loss it will be for you when you have to lose all your
   grandeur and substance! What a loss it will be for you to go from the
   table of Dives to the hell of Dives! Surely it is not a vain thing for
   you. "Well," says another, "but I am a moral and upright person;
   indeed, I do not think anybody can pull my character to pieces." I hope
   nobody wants to; but this is not a vain thing for you, because, let me
   tell you, that fine righteousness of yours is only fine in your own
   esteem. If you could only see it as God sees it, you would see it to be
   as full of holes as ever beggars' rags were when at last they were
   consigned to the dust-heap. I say your fine righteousness, my lady, and
   yours, Sir Squire from the country, no matter though you have given to
   the poor, and fed the hungry, and done a thousand good things; if you
   are relying on them, you are relying on rotten rags, in which God can
   no more accept you than he can accept the thief in his dishonesties.
   "All our righteousness are as filthy rags, and we are all as an unclean
   thing." It is not a vain thing for you, then. "Oh, but I am a young man
   just in my teens, and growing up to manhood; I think I ought to have a
   little pleasure." So I think, friend, and if you want a great deal of
   it, be a Christian. "Oh, but I think young people should enjoy
   themselves." So do I. I never was an advocate for making sheep without
   their first being lambs, and I would let the lambs skip as much as they
   like; but if you want to lead a happy and a joyous life, give you young
   days to Jesus. Who says that a Christian is miserable? Sir, you lie; I
   tell you to your teeth that you know not what Christianity is, or else
   you would know that the Christians are the most joyous people under
   heaven. Young man, I would like you to have a glorious youth; I would
   like you to have all the sparkle and the brilliance which your young
   life can give you. What have you better than to live and to enjoy
   yourself? But how are you to do it? Give your Creator your heart, and
   the thing is done. It is not a vain thing for you. "Ah!" says the old
   man, "but it is a vain thing for me; my time is over; if I had begun
   when I was a lad it might have done; but I am settled in my habits now;
   I feel sure, sir, it is too late for me; when I hear my grand-children
   say their prayers as they are going to bed, pretty dears, when they are
   singing their evening hymn, I wish I was a child again; but my heart
   has got hard, and I cannot say "Our Father' now; and when I do get to
   "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against
   us,' I get stuck there, I do not know how to get over that, for I have
   not forgiven old Jones yet who robbed me in that lawsuit; and then you
   know I am infirm, and have these rheumatics, and a hundred other pains;
   I do not think religion will suit me." Well, it is just the very thing
   that will suit you, because it will make you young again. What, "Can a
   man be born again when he is old?" That is what Nicodemus asked. Yes, a
   man can be born again, so that the babe shall die a hundred years old.
   Oh! to make the autumn of your life and the coming winter of your last
   days into a new spring and a blessed summer-this is to be done by
   laying hold of Christ now; and then you shall feel in your old veins
   the young blood of the new spiritual life, and you will say, "I count
   the years I lived before a death, but now I begin to live."

   I do not know whether I have picked out every character; I am afraid I
   have not; but this thing I know, though you may be under there, or up
   in the corner yonder where my eye cannot reach you, yet you may hear
   this voice and I hope you may hear it when you are gone from this house
   back to your country-towns and to your houses--

   "'Tis religion that can give

   Sweetest pleasures while we live!

   'Tis religion must supply

   Solid comfort when we die.

   After death its joys will be

   Lasting as eternity!

   Be the living God my friend,

   Then my bliss shall never end."

   And this is the gospel which is preached unto you. "Believe in the Lord
   Jesus Christ"--that is trust him--"and thou shalt be saved." May God
   bless you for Christ's sake. Amen.

                             The Friend of Sinners

   A Sermon

   (No. 458)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, June 29th, 1862, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "He was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many,
   and made intercession for the transgressors."--Isaiah 53:12.

   A VAGUE notion is abroad in the world that the benefit of Christ's
   passion is intended only for good people. The preaching of some
   ministers, and the talk of some professors, would lead the uninstructed
   to imagine that Christ came into the world to save the righteous, to
   call the godly to repentance, and to heal those who never were sick.
   There is in most sinners' consciences, when they are aroused, a
   frightful fear that Christ could not have come to bless such as they
   are, but that he must have intended the merit of his blood and the
   efficacy of his passion for those who possess good works or feelings to
   recommend them to him. Dear friends, you will clearly see, if you will
   but open one eye, how inconsistent such a supposition is with the whole
   teaching of Scripture. Consider the plan itself. It was a plan of
   salvation and of necessity it was intended to bless sinners. Wherefore
   salvation if men be not lost, and for whom salvation but for the
   ruined? The plan was based in grace, but how "grace" unless it was
   meant for persons who deserve nothing? If you have to deal with
   creatures who have not sinned, and have been obedient, what need of
   grace? Build then on justice; let merit have its way. But as the whole
   covenant is a covenant of grace, and as in the whole matter it was
   ordained that grace should reign through righteousness unto eternal
   life, it is plain enough from the very plan itself that it must have to
   do with sinners and not with the righteous. Moreover, think of the work
   itself. The work of Christ was to bring in a perfect righteousness. For
   whom, think you? For those who had a righteousness? That were a
   superfluity. Why should he weave a garment for those who were already
   clothed in scarlet and fine linen? He had, moreover, to shed his blood.
   For whom his blood? Wherefore the agony in the garden? Wherefore the
   cry upon the cross? For the perfect? Surely not, beloved. What need had
   they of an atonement? Verily, brethren, the fact that Jesus Christ bled
   for sin upon the cross bears, on its very surface, evidence that he
   came into the world to save sinners. And then look at God's end in the
   whole work. It was to glorify himself, but how could God be glorified
   by washing spotless souls, and by bringing to everlasting glory by
   grace those who could have entered heaven by merit? Inasmuch as the
   plan and design both aim at laying the greatness of human nature in the
   dust, and exalting God, and making his love and his mercy to be
   magnified, it is implied as a matter of necessity, that it came to deal
   with undeserving, ill-deserving sinners, or else that end and aim never
   could be accomplished. Salvation needs a sinner as the raw material
   upon which to exercise its workmanship; the precious blood that
   cleanses needs a filthy sinner upon whom to show its power to purge;
   the atonement of Christ needs guilt upon which to exercise itself in
   the taking of it away; and it is absurd, it is ridiculous, it is
   unworthy of God, to suppose a scheme of salvation, a work so tremendous
   as the atonement of Christ, and an aim so splendid as the glorification
   of God, unless there be sinners to be the instruments of God's glory
   through being the partakers of God's grace. A moment's thought will be
   enough to convince us that the whole plan is made for sinners, and that
   "Jesus Christ died for the ungodly." Indeed, dear friends, it is only
   when we get this view very clearly before us that we see Jesus in his
   glory. When does the shepherd appear most lovely? It is a fair picture
   to pourtray him in the midst of his flock, feeding them in the green
   pastures, and leading them beside the still waters; but if my heart is
   to leap for joy, give me the shepherd pursuing his stray sheep over the
   mountains; let me see him bringing home that sheep upon his shoulders
   rejoicing; let me hear his song of mirth when he calleth upon his
   friends and neighbours to rejoice with him because he has found the
   sheep which was lost. When looks our God most like a loving and tender
   father? Truly he looketh blessed when he divideth his inheritance among
   his sons, but I never saw him so resplendent in his fatherhood as when
   he runneth out to meet the prodigal, throweth his arms about his neck,
   and kisseth him, crying-- "My son that was dead is alive again."
   Indeed, for some offices of Christ, it is absolutely necessary that
   there should be a sinner for us to see any meaning in them at all. He
   is a priest. What need of a priest except for the sins of the people?
   Why, I dare to say it, Christ's priesthood is a mockery and Christ's
   sacrifice is ridiculous unless there be sin in the world, and sinners
   whom Jesus came to save. Brethren, how is he a Saviour except to the
   lost? How is he a physician but to the sick? How is he like the brazen
   serpent if he doth not save the sin-bitten, or how the scapegoat if he
   doth not bear the sin of transgressors?

   Our text, in its threefold character, shows the intimate connection
   which exists between Jesus and sinners, for in none of its sentences is
   there meaning unless there be a sinner, and unless Christ has come into
   connection with him. It is this one point which I want to work out this
   morning, and may God bless it to many a sinner's troubled conscience.
   "He was numbered with the transgressors; he bare the sin of many, and
   he made intercession for the transgressors." It is for transgressors
   all the way through. Bring in a company of righteous people who think
   they have no sin and they cannot appreciate the text; in fact it can
   have no meaning to them.

   I. We shall begin then, by taking the first sentence. To the sinner,
   troubled and alarmed on account of guilt, there will be much comfort in
   the thought that CHRIST IS ENROLLED AMONG SINNERS. "He was numbered
   with the transgressors."

   In what sense are we to understand this? "He was numbered with the
   transgressors."

   He was numbered with them, first, in the census of the Roman empire.
   There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should
   be taxed, and the espoused wife of Joseph, being great with child, must
   travel to Bethlehem that Christ may be born there, and that he may be
   numbered with the transgressing people who, for their sins, were
   subject to the Roman yoke.

   Years rolled on, and that child who had been early numbered with
   transgressors, and had received the seal of transgression in the
   circumcision, which represents the putting away of the flesh--that
   child, having come to manhood, goes forth into the world and is
   numbered with transgressors in the scroll of fame. Ask public rumour
   "What is the character of Jesus of Nazareth?" and it cannot find a word
   in its vocabulary foul enough for him. "This------" they sometimes
   said; and our translators have inserted the word "fellow" because in
   the original there is an ellipsis, the evangelists, I suppose, hardly
   liking to write the word which had been cast upon Christ Jesus. Fame,
   with her lying tongue, said he was a drunken man and a wine-bibber,
   because he would not yield to the asceticism of the age. He would not,
   since he came to be a man among men, do other than eat and drink as
   other men did. He came not to set an example of asceticism but of
   temperance; he came both eating and drinking, and they said at once,
   "Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber." They called him mad. His
   warm enthusiasm, his stern and unflinching rebukes of wickedness in
   high places, brought upon him the accusation that he had a devil. "Thou
   has a devil and art mad," said they. They called the Master of the
   house Beelzebub! Even the drunkards made him their song, and the vilest
   thought him viler than themselves, for he was, by current rumour,
   numbered with the transgressors.

   But to make the matter still more forcible, "he was numbered with
   transgressors in the courts of law." The ecclesiastical court of
   Judaism, the Sanhedrim, said of him, "Thou blasphemest;" and they smote
   him on the cheek. Written down among the offenders against the dignity
   of God against the security of the Jewish Church, you find the name of
   Jesus of Nazareth which was crucified. The courts civil also asserted
   the same. Pilate may wash his hands in water, and say, "I find no fault
   in him," but still, driven by the infernal clamours of an angry people,
   he is compelled to write, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews;" and he
   gives him up to die as a malefactor who has rebelled against the
   sovereign law of the land. Herod, too, the Jewish tetrarch, confirms
   the sentence, and so, with two pens at once, Jesus Christ is written
   down by the civil leaders among transgressors.

   Then, the whole Jewish people numbered him with transgressors; nay,
   they reprobated him as a more abominable transgressor than a thief and
   a murderer who had excited sedition. Barabbas is put in competition
   with Christ, and they say, "Not this man, but Barabbas." See, brethren,
   his being numbered with transgressors is no fiction. Lo, he bears the
   transgressor's scourging! He is tied to the whipping-post, his back is
   marred and scarred; the ploughers make deep furrows, and the blood
   flows in streams. He is numbered with transgressors, for he bears the
   felon's cross; he comes into the street bowed down with the weight of
   his own gibbet, which he must carry upon his raw and bleeding
   shoulders; he goes along to the place of doom; he comes to Calvary--the
   place of a skull--and there, hoisted upon the cross, hanging in
   mid-air, as if earth rejected him and heaven refused him shelter, he
   dies the ignominious death of the cross, and is thus numbered with
   transgressors. But will there be none to enter a protest? Will no eye
   pity? Will no man declare his innocence? None; they are all silent!
   Silent, did I say? 'Tis worse! All earth holds up its hands for his
   death; it is carried unanimously. Jew and Gentile, bond and free, they
   are all there. They thrust out the tongue; they hoot; they laugh; they
   cry, "Let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him." His name is
   written in the calendar of crime by the whole universe; for he is
   despised and rejected of men; of all men is he accounted to be the
   off-scouring of all things, and is put to grief. But will not heaven
   interfere? O God, upon thy throne, wilt thou let the innocent suffer?
   He is fast nailed to the tree, and cries in agony, "I thirst." Wilt
   thou permit this man to be numbered with transgressors? Is it rightly
   done? It is; heaven confirms it. He has no sin of his own, but he has
   the sin of his people upon his shoulders; and God, the Eternal Judge,
   shows that he too considers him to be in the roll of transgressors, for
   he veils his face; and the Eternal Father betakes him to his
   hiding-place, and Christ can neither see a smile nor a glance of his
   Father's face, till he shrieks in agony so unutterable, that the words
   cannot express the meaning of the Redeemer's soul, "My God, my God, why
   hast thou forsaken me?" The only answer from heaven being, "I must
   forsake transgressors; thou art numbered with them, and therefore, I
   must forsake thee." But surely the doom will not be fulfilled?
   Certainly, he will be taken down ere he dies? Death is the curse for
   sin; it cannot come on any but transgressors; it is impossible for the
   innocent to die, as impossible as for immortality to be annihilated.
   Surely, then, the Lord will deliver his Son at the last moment, and
   having tried him in the furnace, he will bring him out? Nay, not so; he
   must become obedient to death, even the death of the cross. He dies
   without a protest on the part of earth, or heaven, or hell; he that was
   numbered with the transgressors, having worn the transgressor's crown
   of thorns, lies in the transgressor's grave. "He made his grave with
   the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no
   violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth." It is a marvellous
   thing, brethren, a marvellous thing! Who ever heard of an angel being
   numbered with devils? Who ever heard of Gabriel being numbered with
   fiends? But this is more marvellous than that would be. Here is the Son
   of God numbered, not with the sons of men (that were a gracious act)
   but numbered with transgressors; numbered, not with the faithful who
   struggle after purity; numbered, not with those who repel temptation
   and resist sin; numbered, not with those who earn unto themselves a
   good degree and much boldness in the faith--that were a marvellous
   condescension; but here it is written, "He was numbered with the
   transgressors."

   I must pause here a moment, and get you to think this matter over a
   little. It is a strange and wonderful thing, and ought not to be passed
   by in silence. Why, think you, was Christ numbered with transgressors?
   First, surely, because he could the better become their advocate. I
   believe, in legal phraseology, in civil cases, the advocate considers
   himself to be part and partner with the person for whom he pleads. You
   hear the counsellor continually using the word "we;" he is considered
   by the judge to represent the person for whom he is an advocate. In
   some suits of law, there is on the part of the bar and the bench, a
   perfect identification of the counsellor with the client; nor can they
   be looked upon in the eye of the law as apart from one another. Now,
   Christ, when the sinner is brought to the bar, appears there himself.
   The trumpet sounds; the great assize is set. Come, come, ye sinners,
   come to the bar to be tried. There stands the man whose hands are
   pierced; he standeth numbered with transgressors. Let the trial
   proceed. What is the accusation? He stands to answer it; he points to
   his side, his hands, his feet, and challenges Justice to bring anything
   against the sinners whom he represents; he pleads his blood, and pleads
   so triumphantly, being numbered with them and having a part with them,
   that the Judge proclaims, "Let them go their way; deliver them from
   going down into the pit, for he at their head hath found a ransom."

   But there is another reason why Christ was numbered with transgressors,
   namely, that he might plead with them. Suppose a number of prisoners
   confined in one of our old jails, and there is a person desirous to do
   them good, imagine that he cannot be admitted unless his name is put
   down in the calendar. Well, out his abundant love to these prisoners he
   consents to it, and when he enters to talk with them, they perhaps
   think that he will come in with cold dignity; but he says, "Now, let me
   say to you first of all that I am one of yourselves." "Well," they say,
   "but have you done aught that is wrong?" "I will not answer you that,"
   saith he; "but if you will just refer to the calendar you will find my
   name there; I am written down there among you as a criminal." Oh, how
   they open their hearts now! They opened their eyes with wonder first,
   but now they open their hearts, and they say, "Art thou become like one
   of us? Then we will talk with thee." And he begins to plead with them.
   Sinner, dost thou see this? Christ puts himself as near on a level with
   thee as he can. He cannot be sinful as thou art, for he is God and
   perfect man; but he so puts his name down in the list that when the
   roll is called his name is called over with thine. Oh, how near doth he
   come to thee in thy ruined state!

   Then he does this that sinners may feel their hearts drawn to him. What
   dost thou become poor as I am that I may be made rich? Jesu, Son of
   God, dost thou allow thyself to be numbered among lost ones that thou
   mightest find me? Oh, then my soul shall open itself to give thee a
   hearty reception. Come in, thou loving Saviour, abide with me, and go
   no more out for ever. There is a tendency in awakened sinners to be
   afraid of Christ; but who will be afraid of a man that is numbered with
   us, and put down in the same list with us? Surely now we may come
   boldly to him, and confess our guilt. He that is numbered with us
   cannot condemn us. He whose name is down in the same indictment with
   ourselves, cometh not to condemn, but to absolve; not to curse, but to
   bless.

   He was put down in the transgressors' list that we might be written in
   the red roll of the saints. He was holy, and written among the holy; we
   were guilty, and numbered among the guilty; he transfers his name from
   yonder list to this black indictment, and ours are taken from the
   indictment, foul and filthy, and written in the roll which is fair and
   glorious, for there is a transfer made between Christ and his people.
   All that we have goes to Christ, sin and all; and all that Christ has
   comes to us. His righteousness, his blood, and everything that he hath
   belongeth unto us.

   Dear hearers, before I leave this point I want to put this to you. Is
   this yours by faith? Remember, faith is wanted here; nothing else. "He
   was numbered with transgressors." Oh, soul, can thy heart say, "Then if
   he was numbered with me, if he put his name down where mine stands in
   that terrific roll, then I will believe in him that he is able and
   willing to save me, and I will trust my soul in his hands?" I conjure
   thee by the living God do it, man, and thy soul is saved. Oh, by him
   who from the highest throne in glory stooped to the cross of deepest
   ignominy, trust thy soul with him. It is all he asks of thee, and this
   he gives thee. Blessed Master, would that thou couldst stand here, and
   say, "Sinners, full of iniquity, I stood with you; God accounted me as
   if I had committed your sin, and visited me as if I had been a
   transgressor; trust me; cast your souls upon my perfect righteousness;
   wash in my cleansing blood, and I will make you whole, and present you
   faultless before my Father's face."

   II. We are taught in the next sentence, that Christ "BARE THE SINS OF
   MANY."

   Here it is as clear as noon-day, that Christ dealt with sinners. Do not
   say Christ died for those who have done no wrong. That is not the
   description given. It is clear, I say, to everyone that chooses to
   look, that Christ could not bear the sins of those who had no sins, but
   could only bear the sins of men who were sinful and guilty. Briefly,
   then, but very plainly, to recount the old, old story over again: man
   stood with a load of sin upon his shoulders, so heavy that it would
   have crushed him lower than the lowest hell; Christ Jesus came into the
   world, stood in the room, place, and stead of his people; and he did,
   in the expressive words of the text, bear their sins--that is to say,
   their sins were really, not in a legal fiction, but really transferred
   from them to him. You see, a man cannot bear a thing which is not on
   his back; it is impossible that he can bear it unless it is actually
   there. The word "bear," implies weight, and weight is the sure
   indicator of reality. Christ did bear sin in its fulness, vileness, and
   condemnation upon his own shoulders. Comprehend this, then, and you
   have the marrow of the subject. Christ did really, literally, and
   truly, take the sins that belonged to all who do believe on him, and
   those sins did actually and in very deed become his sins; (not that he
   had committed them, nor that he had any part or lot in them, except
   through the imputation to which he had consented, and for which he came
   in to the world,) and there lay the sins of all his people upon
   Christ's shoulders.

   Then notice, that as he did bear them, so other texts tell us that he
   did bear them away. "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
   of the world." Sin being on his head, the scape-goat took it away,
   away, away. Where? Into the wilderness of forgetfulness. If it be
   sought for it shall not be found; the Everlasting God seeth it no more,
   it hath ceased to be, for he hath finished iniquity and made an end of
   sin; and when there is an end of it what more can be said? Christ took
   our debts, but he was not long before he paid them all. Where, then,
   are the debts? There are no debts now; there is not one in God's book
   against his chosen, for Jesus died. If Christ hath paid the debt, then
   there is no debt left; it is gone. I can rejoice in its discharge; I
   can mourn that ever I cast myself into such a position, but the debt
   itself I gone. "I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day."
   "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our
   transgressions from us." "I will cast their sins into the midst of the
   sea." And yet again, "I will put away thy sin like a cloud, and thine
   iniquity like a thick cloud." Now, there were some clouds during the
   last week, but where are they now? They have turned to rain; they are
   gone; no strong-winged angel could find those clouds again; there are
   no such things; they are gone. And so with believers' sins, they were
   black, thick, thick clouds; full of tempests; big with lightnings and
   with thunder; but they are gone. The drops have fallen upon Christ; the
   thunder and the lightning have spent their fury upon him, and the
   clouds are gone, for Christ has taken them away. "He bare the sins of
   many," and he bore them away for ever.

   And then, beloved, you must understand that if it be so, if Christ did
   really bear his people's sins, and did bear them away--and since a
   thing cannot be in two places at one time, there is now no sin abiding
   upon those for whom Jesus died. "And who are they?" you say. Why, all
   those who trust him. Any man whatsoever, the wide world over, who shall
   ever trust Christ, may know that no sin can be with him because his sin
   was laid on Christ. Oh, I do delight in this precious doctrine! If
   anything could unloose my poor stammering tongue, this might, to see
   sin literally transferred so that there is none left! I cannot express
   the delight and joy of my soul at this moment, in contemplation of the
   blessed deliverance and release which Christ has given. I can only sing
   out again with Kent--

   "Sons of God, redeemed by blood,

   Raise your songs to Zion's God--

   Made from condemnation free,

   Grace triumphant sing with me."

   Now, do you not see that his must be for sinners? See, you black ones,
   you filthy ones, you lost ones, you ruined ones, this is for sinners.
   You see it does not say it was for sensible sinners; no, no, but
   sinners. It does not say, "He was numbered with awakened
   transgressors;" no, it is "transgressors." It does not say that he bare
   the sins of tender-hearted sinners; no, but "he bare the sin of many."
   This is the only description I can find in my text. Jesus Christ came
   into the world to save sinners, and if in very deed and truth I know
   myself to be this day a sinner, I may trust Christ, and trusting Christ
   I may know, as surely as there is a God in heaven, that Jesus Christ
   took my sins and carried them all away. Now, I want to know whether you
   have got this by an act of faith this morning. "Oh," says one, "I am a
   sinner, but, but--." Well, what but? If you be a sinner, you are
   commanded to trust Christ this morning. "Oh, but--." I will have no
   "buts," sir, no "but" whatever. Are you a sinner? Yes or no. If you say
   "No," then I have nothing to say to you; Jesus Christ came not to call
   the righteous, but sinners to repentance. If you are a sinner, to you
   is the Word of this salvation sent. "But I have been a thief!" I
   suppose a thief is a sinner? "But I have been a drunkard!" A drunkard
   is a sinner. "But I have been an unclean liver!" You are a sinner,
   then. "But I have such a hard heart!" Well, to have a hard heart is one
   of the greatest sins in the world. "But I am unbelieving!" Well, that
   is a sin too. You come in under the list of sinners, and I say that
   such Christ contemplated, and the two sentences we have already
   considered prove this to a demonstration. He contemplated such as you
   are when he came to save, for "he was numbered with transgressors," and
   "he bare"--not the virtues of many, not the merits of many, not the
   good works of many, but "the sin of many." So, if you have any sin,
   here is Christ the sin-bearer; and if you are a sinner, here is Christ,
   numbered with you. "Oh!" says one, "but what is faith? I want to know
   at once." Faith, sinner, is to believe in Jesus, and to trust in Jesus
   now. Saving faith can sing this verse--

   "Just as I am, and waiting not

   To rid my soul of one foul blot,

   To thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,

   O Lamb of God, I come, I come."

   It is as sinners, not as sensible sinners, not as repenting sinners,
   that Jesus died for us. Sinners as sinners, Jesus Christ has chosen,
   redeemed, and called; in fact, for them, and for only such, Jesus
   Christ came into the world.

   III. Our third sentence tells us that JESUS INTERCEDES FOR SINNERS.
   "And made intercession for the transgressors."

   He prays for his saints, but, dear friends, remember that by nature
   they are transgressors, and nothing more.

   What does our text say? He intercedes for transgressors! There is a
   transgressor here this morning. He has been hearing the gospel for many
   years--for many years; and he has heard it preached faithfully too. He
   is growing grey now; but while his head is getting white his heart is
   black; he is an old hard-hearted reprobate, and by-and-bye, unless
   grace prevents--but I need not tell that story. What is that I hear?
   The feet of justice, slowly but surely coming. I hear a voice
   saying--"Lo, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree
   and find none; cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?" The woodman
   feels his axe; it is sharp and keen. "Now," says he, "I will lay to at
   this barren tree, and cut it down." But hark! There is one that maketh
   intercession for transgressors, hear him, hear him, "Spare it yet a
   little while, till I dig about it and dung it, and if it bear fruit
   well; but if not, after that thou shalt cut it down." You see there was
   nothing in that tree why he should plead for it, and there is nothing
   in you why he should plead for you, yet he does it. This very morning,
   perhaps, he is crying "Spare him yet a little while; let him hear the
   gospel again; let him be entreated once more; oh! let him have another
   sickness that it may make his conscience feel; let me have another
   endeavour with his hard heart; it may be, it may be that he will
   yield." O sinner, bless God that Jesus Christ pleads for you in that
   way.

   But that done, he pleads for their forgiveness. They are nailing him to
   the cross; the wretches are driving iron through his hands; but even
   while they fasten him to the tree hear him--"Father, forgive them, for
   they know not what they do." Oh, I spoke to a brother this week, whose
   heart all-conquering love touched. He had been a great blasphemer, and
   when we were talking together about the fact that Jesus Christ loved
   him even when he was cursing, I saw how it broke his heart; and it
   broke mine too, to think that I could rebel against Christ whilst he
   was loving me; that I could despise him while he was putting himself in
   my way in order to do me good. Oh! it is this that breaks a man's
   heart; to think that Christ should have been loving me, with the whole
   force of his soul, while I was despising him, and would have nothing to
   do with him. There is a man there who has been cursing, and swearing,
   and blaspheming, and the very man whom he has cursed has been crying
   "Father, forgive him, for he knows not what he does." O sinner, I would
   this might break thy heart, and bring thee to the Saviour.

   Nor does he end there. He next prays that those for whom he intercedes
   may be saved, and may have a new life given them. "I will pray the
   Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with
   you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive."
   Every soul that is quickened by the Holy Spirit is so quickened as the
   result of his intercession for transgressors. His prayer brings down
   the life, and dead sinners live. When they live he does not cease to
   pray for them, for by his intercession they are preserved. They are
   tempted and tried, but hear what he says. "Satan hath desired to have
   thee that he may sift thee as wheat, but I have prayed for thee that
   thy strength fail not." Yes, brethren, beloved, and this is the reason
   why we are not condemned, for our Apostle puts it--"Who is he that
   condemneth?" and the answer he gives is, "Christ hath died, yea,
   rather, hath risen again, who ever maketh intercession for us;" as if
   that intercession choked at once the advocate of hell, and delivered us
   from condemnation. And more, our coming to glory is the result of the
   pleading of Christ for transgressors. "Father, I will that they also
   whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my
   glory."

   There are a great many sermons preached that have not the gospel in
   them, especially those sermons the drift of which is to tell the
   sinners "Go home and pray; go home and pray." That is very good advice,
   but it is not the gospel. The sinner might answer me, "How can I come
   before God as I am; I cannot plead before him, for I am a wretch
   undone; if I should stand in his presence he would drive me from him."
   Behold Jesus Christ maketh intercession for transgressors. It is a
   common saying in the world, that a man who pleads his own cause has a
   fool for his client, certainly it is so in heaven. But when Christ
   comes in, the Wonderful, the Counsellor, he takes up the brief, and now
   the adversary trembles, for no sooner does he find that the suit is put
   into the hands of him who is the advocate of his people than he knows
   that his case is lost, and that the sinner will go free. So, sinner,
   you are safe if he pleads for you. "Ah," say you, "but if he asks me
   what he should plead I have nothing to tell him." You know the
   counsellor goes into the cell, and he says to the prisoner--"Now, just
   tell me the case; what can I say in your favour?" The criminal replies,
   "Well, there is so-and-so, and so-and-so," and perhaps he is able to
   say "Why, sir, I am as innocent as a new-born babe of the whole affair,
   and I can prove an alibi, or I can do this or that." Very well; the
   advocate having ground to go upon, pleads the case in the court right
   confidently. But now I hear you say, "Ah, I cannot tell the Lord Jesus
   Christ what he is to plead, for I have nothing to plead; the fact is I
   am guilty, and thoroughly guilty too, and I deserve to be punished, and
   must be; I have nothing to plead." Now what does our blessed Advocate
   say? "Oh," saith he, "but I have the plea in myself;" and up he rises
   in the court of law, and when the accusation is read he puts in this to
   that accusation--"In the name of the sinner for whom I intercede, and
   with whom I am numbered, I plead absolution and forgiveness through
   punishment already borne." "How?" saith Justice. And he shows the
   nail-prints in his hands, and lays bare his side, and says, "I suffered
   for that sinner; I was punished with the sinner's punishment, and
   therefore I claim, as the reward of my passion and my agony, that the
   sinner should go his way." Do you not see that Christ is a precious
   pleader because he can appear for us, and what is more, he can find a
   plea for us. "Ah!" I hear you say, "but I have no means of getting such
   an advocate as that; I wish I had, but I have nothing to give him; if
   he asks any fees I have nothing; I do not deserve the love of Christ; I
   do not know why he should take up my cause; if he would I should be
   saved, but I cannot think he will, for I cannot hope to pay him."
   "Nay," says he, "but I will take up your cause freely, willingly,
   cheerfully, and I will make intercession for you, not because you
   deserve it, but because you need it; not because you are not a
   transgressor, but because you are." That very thing, sinner, that makes
   you think Christ will not look at you, is the very reason why he will.
   You are full of disease. "Ah!" say you, "the physician will never look
   at such an arm as that;" but because the ulcer is reeking, that is why
   he stops and says, "I will cure that." Your qualification is your
   disqualification, and what you think to be the reason why he never will
   look at you, is certainly the only reason you can plead why he should.
   You are nothing; you are utterly lost; you have no merit; you have
   nothing unless the Lord Jesus Christ make prevalent, acceptable, and
   perpetual intercession for transgressors.

   I come to a conclusion reluctantly; but I must say these few words.
   There are some of you that make very light of sinning. I pray you be
   reasonable, and think this matter over. It was no light thing for God
   to save a sinner, for the Son of God himself must be numbered with
   sinners, and smart and die for sinners, or else they could not be
   saved. Touch not the unclean thing; hate it. If it is deadly to a holy
   Christ, it must be damnable to you. Oh! pass it by, and loathe it as
   the Egyptians loathed the water of the river when it was turned to
   blood in their sight.

   To you who make but little of Christ, there is this word: you know what
   sin means; I do not think you can ever make too much of sin, but I pray
   you do not make too little of Christ. To you who think you have no
   qualifications for Christ, I say this closing sentence: I do beseech
   you get rid of that foul, that legal, that soul-destroying idea that
   Christ wants any preparation by you or in you before you come to him.
   You may come to him now; nay, more, you are commanded to come to him
   now, just as you are. And to every man among you to-day, and to every
   woman and child, I preach this gospel in the name of Jesus Christ:
   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Trust him
   now--in your seat--standing in the aisles--crowded in these galleries--
   trust him now; God commands you. "This is the commandment, that ye
   believe on Jesus Christ whom he hath sent." As Peter said, so say I,
   "Repent and be converted, every one of you;" and as Paul said to the
   Philippian jailer, so say I, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   thou shalt be saved, and thy house." If you do not, this shall condemn
   you; not your sin, but your unbelief; for they that believe not are
   condemned already, Why, why are such condemned? Because they believe
   not. That is the accusation; that is the damning crime and curse.
   "Well," says one, "then if God commands me to trust Christ, though I
   certainly have no reason why I should, then I'll do it." Ah! soul, do
   it then. Can you do it? Can you trust him now? Is it a full trust? Are
   you leaning on your feelings? Give them up. Are you depending a little
   on what you mean to do? Give that up. Do you trust him wholly? Can you
   say, "His blessed wounds, his flowing blood, his perfect righteousness,
   on these I rest. I do trust him, wholly?" Are you half afraid to say
   you do? Do you think it is such a bold thing? Do it then; do a bold
   thing for once! Say, "Lord, I'll trust thee, and if thou cast me away,
   I'll still trust thee; I bless thee that thou canst save me, and that
   thou wilt save me." Can you say that? I say, have you believed in him?
   You are saved, then; you are not in a salvable state, but you are
   saved; not partly, but wholly saved; not some of your sins blotted out,
   but all; behold the whole list, and it is written at the bottom of them
   all: "The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin." But I hear
   one say, "It is too good to be true!" Soul, wilt thou be lost through
   thinking little things of Christ? "Ah!" says another, "it is too
   simple; if this be the gospel, we shall have all the ragamuffins in the
   streets believing in Christ and being saved." And glory be to God if it
   be so! For my part I am never afraid of big sinners being saved. I
   would have every harlot, I would have every whoremonger and adulterer
   to be saved. I would not be afraid that they would go on in their sins
   if they believed in Christ. Oh! no; faith in Christ would change their
   nature; and it will change yours too; for this is salvation: to have
   the nature changed, to be made a new creature in Christ, and to be made
   holy. Come, soul, wilt thou trust him? I do not like you all to go away
   after crowding in here without getting that blessing. Some of you have
   come up to the Handel Festival; but here is better music if you trust
   Christ, for you shall hear the bells of heaven ringing, and all the
   music of the angels as they rejoice over you as a brother redeemed.
   Many of you have come up to see the Great Exhibition; but here is a
   greater wonder than that, if you came into this place this morning in a
   state of nature, and go out in a state of grace, only to wait a little
   while, and then to reach a state of glory! Some of you have come up to
   see the great Cattle Show; but here is something better to see than
   ever was reared on English pasture; here is food for your souls; here
   is that whereof if a man eateth he shall live for ever; and here it is
   held out to you. Nothing can be plainer. Trust Christ and you are
   saved. Outside in the street there is a drinking-fountain. When you get
   there, if you are thirsty go to it; you will find no policeman there to
   send you away. No one will cry, "You must not drink because you do not
   wear a satin dress." "You must not drink because you wear a fustian
   jacket." No, no, go and drink; and when you have hold of the ladle and
   are putting it to your lips, if there should come a doubt--"I do not
   feel my thirst enough," still take a drink whether you do or not. So I
   say to you, Jesus Christ stands like a great flowing fountain in the
   corners of the street, and he inviteth every thirsty soul to come and
   drink. You need not stop and say, "Am I thirsty enough? Am I black
   enough?" You do want it whether you think you do or not. Come as you
   are; come as you are. Every fitness is legality; every preparation is a
   lie; every getting ready for Chrst is coming the wrong way. You are
   only making yourselves worse while you think you are making yourselves
   better. You are like a boy at school who has made a little blot, and he
   gets out his knife to scratch it out, and makes it ten times worse than
   before. Leave the blots alone. Come as you are. If you are the blackest
   soul out of hell, trust Christ, and that act of trust shall make you
   clean. This seems a simple thing, and yet it is the hardest thing in
   the world to bring you to it; so hard a thing that all the preachers
   that ever preached cannot make a man believe in Christ. Though we put
   it as plainly as we can, and plead with you, you only go away and say,
   "It is too good to be true;" or else you despise it because it is so
   simple; for the gospel, like Christ, is despised and rejected of men,
   because it has no form and comeliness, and no beauty in it that they
   should desire it. Oh! may the Holy Ghost lay this home to you; may he
   make you willing in the day of his power. I hope he has; I trust he
   has, so that ere we go we may all join in singing this one verse, and
   then separate;--

   "A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,

   On Christ's kind arms I fall;

   He is my strength; my righteousness,

   My Jesus, and my all."

                           A Sermon For Men Of Taste

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 6, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Therefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies, and
   envies and all evil speaking, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk
   of the Word, that you may grow thereby. If, indeed, you have tasted
   that the Lord is gracious." 1 Peter 2:1-3.

   "IF, indeed, you have tasted that the Lord is gracious." "If" If, then,
   is not a thing to be taken for granted concerning all of the human
   race. "IP--then there is a possibility, and a probability, that some
   may not have tasted that the Lord is gracious. "If, if--then this is
   not a general but a special mercy. And it becomes our business to
   enquire whether we are in that company, who know the Grace of God by
   inward experience.

   There is no spiritual favor which may not be a matter for
   heart-searching. At the very summit of holy delight, we meet the
   challenge of sentinel "IP--"Ifyou, then, are risen with Christ," and at
   the very bottom, even at Repentance Gate itself, he meets us with a
   warrant of arrest until he sees whether our sorrow is the godly sorrow
   that needs not to be repented of. "Ifyou are the Son of God," is not
   always a temptation of the devil but often a very healthy enquiry most
   fittingly suggested by holy anxiety to men who would build securely
   upon the Rock of Ages.

   If at the Lord's Table, itself, it is proper for us to say, "Lord, is
   it I?" when there is a Judas in the company, and if after the most
   intimate fellowship, Christ exclaimed, "Simon, son of Jonas, do you
   love me?"--let no enjoyment of ordinances, let no high and rapt
   fellowship which we may have known, exempt us from the great duty of
   proving ourselves whether we are in the faith.

   But, Beloved, albeit this should be a matter of heart-searching, I take
   it that no man ought to be content while there is any such thing as an
   "if about his having tasted that the Lord is gracious. I can understand
   Believers saying--

   "It is a point I long to know, Often it causes anxious thought.
   Do I love the Lord or no? Am I His, or am I not?"

   But I do not understand their being comfortable while their souls are
   under such suspense. I can comprehend the doubts which arise from
   jealousy and holy distrust, but I cannot understand the continuance of
   those doubts, without a desperate struggle to clasp the Savior with the
   hands of faith, and say, "I know whom I have believed and I am
   persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed to Him."

   Do not rest, O Believer, till you have a full assurance of your
   interest in Christ. Let nothing satisfy you till, by the infallible
   witness of the Holy Spirit bearing witness with your spirit, you are
   certified that you are a child of God. Oh, trifle not here. Let no
   "perhaps," and "if," and "maybe," satisfy your soul. Build on eternal
   verities and verily build upon them. Get the sure mercies of David and
   surely get them. Let your anchor be cast into that which is within the
   vein and see to it that your soul is linked to the anchor by a cable
   that will not break.

   Dear Brothers and Sisters in Jesus, I exhort and stir you up to get
   beyond these dreary "ifs." Abide no more in the howling wilderness of
   doubts and fears. Cross the Jordan of distrust and enter the Canaan of
   peace, where the Canaanite still lingers but which ceases not to flow
   with milk and honey.

   Our text mentions a taste--"If, indeed, you have tasted that the Lord
   is gracious." And the Apostle speaks of the duty of those men of taste
   who have received this special favor. These two things shall take up
   our time this morning--the taste and the duties arising out of it And
   before we conclude, we shall go back to the Psalm with which we
   commenced this morning, and address those who as yet have never tasted
   that the Lord is gracious, in the words of David--"O taste and see that
   the Lord is good!"

   I. First, then, TASTE is prominent in the text. I scarcely need
   observe, that in Scripture, the Holy Spirit uses natural things as
   figures by which to set forth spiritual mysteries. Inasmuch as our
   language was ordained to speak the thoughts of the mind and to describe
   the things of the body, it is not fitted, in itself, for the utterance
   of the things of the spirit. As much as the soul is higher than the
   body, so much superior is the spirit (that is, the new principle
   implanted in regeneration) to the mere soul which every man possesses.
   And, as you will clearly see, if our speech had only been made for the
   body and had not been adapted for a being that had a soul, we should
   have been strangely embarrassed for the expression of our mental
   emotions.

   And now, as our speech only reaches unto the natural soul, if we would
   speak of the higher thoughts and impulses of the inner and newborn
   spirit, we can only do so by using the words we employ concerning
   natural objects. In this way we do not so much describe spiritual
   things as they are in themselves, but bring them down to our
   comprehension. When we shall become pure spirits, we may have a
   spiritual language. When we are caught up to the third Heaven, we shall
   use those words which now are not lawful for a man to
   utter--spiritualwords fitted for spiritual'things.

   1. The taste here meant is doubtless faith. Faith, in the Scripture, is
   all the senses. It is sight. "Look unto Me and be you saved, all you
   ends of the earth." "They looked unto Him and were lightened and their
   faces were not ashamed." It is hearing--"Hear and your soul shall live.
   And I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you, even the sure mercies
   of David." Faith hears the voice of the Spirit in effectual
   calling--for the dead hear the voice of God, and "they that hear shall
   live." Faith is also smelling. "All your garments smell of myrrh and
   aloes and cassia." "Your name is as ointment poured forth." "A bundle
   of myrrh is my well-beloved unto Me."

   Faith is also touch. By this faith the woman came behind and touched
   the hem of Christ's garment and by this we handle the things of the
   good word of life. Faith is equally the spirit's taste. "How sweet are
   Your Words to my taste! Yes, sweeter than honey to my lips." "Except a
   man eat My flesh," says Christ, "and drink My blood, there is no life
   in him." We shall have an inward and spiritual apprehension of the
   sweetness and preciousness of Christ, as the result of living faith.

   2. The taste here meant is faith in one of its highest operations. One
   of the first performances of faith is hearing. We hear the voice of
   God, not with the outward ear alone but with the inward ear. We hear it
   as God's Word, and we believe it to be so. That is the hearing of
   faith. Then our mind looks upon the Truth of God as it is presented to
   us. That is to say, we understand it, we see what it means--that is the
   seeingof faith. Then we perceive its preciousness to others, if not to
   ourselves. We begin to admire it and find how fragrant it is. That is
   faith in its smell. Then comes the appropriating act by which we lay
   hold of the mercies that are offered us in Christ. That is faith in its
   touch.

   Then come enjoyments, peace, delight, communion--which are faith in its
   taste. Any one of these acts of faith is saving. To hear Christ's voice
   as the very voice of God in the soul will save us. But that which gives
   the true enjoyment is the aspect of faith wherein Christ, by holy
   taste, becomes assimilated to us. We feed on Him. He comes into us and
   becomes part of us. His living word sustains us and His precious blood
   cheers us as generous wine. Do you ask, "In what respect does faith
   taste that the Lord is gracious?" It is faith operating by experience.

   Dear Christian Friends, you remember the time, when laden with guilt
   and full of fears, you looked to Jesus Christ--it was the eye of faith
   which looked. After a while Christ's sweet love assured you that your
   sins were forgiven and you felt a calm in your soul, such as you had
   never known before. That was tasting Christ. You knew His sweetness,
   you knew the power there was in Him to take the bitterness out of your
   mouth and to put in sweetness instead. Since that time you have been in
   trouble but you have tasted Christ, for He has comforted you and lifted
   up the light of His countenance upon you.

   You have been often greatly tried but He has sustained you and you have
   experienced that He is a very present help in time of trouble.
   Temptation has assailed you but you have been able to meet it by,
   "Christ in you, the hope of glory." And perhaps even today your soul is
   as full as it can be, of delightful contemplations of the loveliness,
   the faithfulness, the affection, the power and the glory of your
   precious Lord Jesus Christ. Now, this is what is meant by tasting. It
   is enjoying Christ by an act of faith and finding Him to be the
   altogether lovely, sweet, and precious One.

   It is something more than believing Christ to be precious. It is
   perceiving His worth, appreciating His sweetness, enjoying His
   loveliness. It is lying with His left hand under our head, while His
   right hand does embrace us. Thrice happy is the man who has thus tasted
   that the Lord is gracious. Follow me, while by a figure I make this
   point clear as noonday.

   There is a rumor running through the camp of Israel, that God on the
   morrow, at the rising of the sun, will feed His people. The rumor is
   believed. That is faith as hearing. Israel has heard that God will feed
   and Israel believes. See now-- before daybreak the hosts of Israel
   hasten to the borders of the camp and they see lying upon the ground
   certain grains like coriander seed.

   "This, this," they say, "is the food that God has sent to us." That is
   faith as seeing. They take it up in their hands. They examine it, and
   feel of what sort it is. That is faith as the touch. They put it to
   their nostrils. They ascertain somewhat of its character by the very
   smell. This is faith judging and discerning as smell. But lo! They
   place it in their mouths, and one of them says, "It tastes like wafers
   made with honey." And another says "It is as fresh oil." This is faith
   enjoying, for now they have come, not to hear of, nor see, nor smell,
   nor touch, alone, but as men to eat angel's food and are fed even to
   the full. Here you see faith in its progressive works ending by the
   high degree of tasting.

   3. Faith as exhibited to us under the aspect of tasting, is a sure and
   certain mark of Divine Grace in the heart It is a sure sign of
   vitality. Man, by nature, is dead in trespasses and sins. See if the
   dead can taste. Bring the most pungent drugs--do these arouse the
   palate? Give them a foul draught and see if nausea can be produced.
   Now, put sweets to the dead man's tongue--do the eyes glisten? It is
   long since that corpse has fed--does it show any satisfaction in the
   presence of food? No. It is dead and taste has fled with the once
   sentient soul. Verily, Brethren, no man can taste of Christ in his
   natural estate, and if you or I know Christ to be precious, we may be
   sure that we are alive through the Holy Spirit.

   We may not be able to say when the Spirit of God came into us--perhaps
   this may be a trouble to us--that we do not know the day when we were
   quickened from our death in sin. But dear Friend, the life itself is
   there. Do you enjoy Christ? Is His name sweet music to you? Oh, can you
   roll the doctrine of His atonement under your tongue as a sweet morsel?
   Say, is His flesh food to you? Do you rejoice in His redemption? Then
   you are alive, for no dead soul ever could taste heavenly things. To
   taste that the Lord is good is a certain evidence that the quickening
   Spirit abides in you. Or, to put it in another light. If men have a
   taste of Christ, it is certain evidence of a Divine change, for men by
   nature find no delight in Jesus.

   Books of surgery tell us of a few persons without taste but the cure
   for such unfortunates is unknown. Their infirmity is beyond the reach
   of drugs or surgery. If a man should be without hearing, the surgeon
   might, perhaps, effectually operate. Or if blind, the film might be
   removed from the visual orb. But if without taste, the defect is beyond
   the range of mortal power. So, if any man has a taste for Christ,
   inasmuch as he had it not by nature, and he could not have obtained it
   of himself, his is a case out of the pale of human ability. That same
   Christ who raised the dead, must have given this holy taste to the
   tasteless palate and tongue of the sinner.

   I do not enquire what your experience may have been, or may not have
   been. If Christ is precious to you, there has been a work of Divine
   Grace in your heart. If you love Him, if His Presence is your joy, if
   His blood is your hope, if His glory is your object and aim, and if His
   Person is the constant love of your soul, you could not have had this
   taste by nature--for you were dead. You could not have acquired this
   taste by learning--for this is a miracle which none but the God who is
   supreme over nature could have worked in you. Let every tried and
   troubled Christian, who nevertheless does taste that the Lord is good,
   take consolation from this simple remark.

   4. In the next place. This taste, where it has been bestowed by Divine
   Grace, is a discerning faculty. There have been instances of persons
   who could not discern between the various flavors. A man was well known
   to a certain surgeon, who could just detect the distinction between the
   smell of garlic and the fragrance of a rose, but was quite incapable of
   knowing any difference between the perfume of a rose and of a lily. And
   the same person in feeding could never distinguish between different
   meats or drinks, except between the more pungent and rancid and the
   more exquisitely sweet.

   Now, there are some Christians of that kind, who have some taste for
   Christ, but their taste is not very discerning. You may preach to them
   a doctrine of "ifs," and "ands," and "buts," and if it is warmly
   delivered and well disguised, they will hardly know what they are
   taking. Then, on another occasion, you may give them the sure mercies
   of David-- "shalls," and "wills," and everlasting verities, and oaths,
   and covenants, and they like that, too. For they have not yet, by
   reason of use, become able to discern between the Truth of God and
   error.

   Yet, mark you, there was never yet a Christian who did not know the
   difference between the Rose of Sharon and the garlic of Egypt. There
   was never yet a man renewed by Divine Grace who did not soon discover
   the difference between works and Gospel, between Law and Grace. Between
   the dead efforts of the flesh and the living power of the quickening

   Spirit of the living God. I have noticed that some Christians in these
   modern times have but little taste, and do you know to what I have
   ascribed it? I think they have taken a cold and have thus lost very
   much of their power of taste. Oh, how many Believers there are who sit
   in the draught of worldliness till they get stiff-necks of carnal pride
   and lose their taste for heavenly things! Besides, if a man will ruin
   his palate with the high-spiced food of earth, it is little marvel that
   when he comes back to his natural food, Christ Jesus, he should have
   lost some of his delight in Divine things!

   Now, I know there are some professors who have such a taste for worldly
   joys, that it is no marvel that they cannot so well discern the Divine
   and exquisite pleasure that is in Christ Jesus, when they are fed upon
   by the Holy Spirit. Yet again, I say, though the degree of discernment
   may vary, there is a discerning power in faith as taste. If you can
   feed on a religion which gives you ceremonies to trust to, you have
   never tasted that the Lord is gracious. If, my Hearer, you can live
   upon a Gospel which leads you to depend upon yourself, you have no
   spiritual taste, or else you would loathe, as much as any Egyptian
   loathed to drink of the waters of the Nile when turned into blood.

   You would only drink of the cool stream of the river of life which
   rises at the foot of the Throne of God and flows around the base of
   Calvary, where Jesus shed His blood. Say, Soul, do you love Jesus only?
   Is He all your salvation and all your desire, and do you trust and
   repose wholly and solely in Him? For if not, then you have no spiritual
   taste--and you have no reason to believe that you belong to Jesus
   Christ at all.

   5. But, again, to pass on, having sufficiently enlarged upon that
   point. Faith as a taste is not simply a discerning but a delighting
   faculty Men derive much satisfaction from the organs of taste. We ought
   not to be as the glutton, whose only reason for living is that he may
   eat. But everyone of us may be thankful that God has not made the
   repairing of our frame to be an obnoxious operation and that He has
   given us a capacity for enjoying the flavors of food. Certain critics
   have a faith which is very good for discerning but never for enjoying.

   They have a fine nose for heresy. The moment it comes anywhere near
   them they discover it. And if there is half a word in a sermon they do
   not like, how sure they will be to take it home. One bad fish in our
   basket and it will be cried all round the town before tomorrow. But let
   us offer ever so much that is good, we can scarce win a notice. Dear
   Friends, I would have God's people discern, but the discerning
   propensity ought not to destroy the enjoyingfaculty. I bless God I love
   the Doctrines of Grace but I never considered the Doctrines of Grace to
   be like drawn swords with which to fight every man living.

   I know it is a good thing to be like the armed men about the bed of
   Solomon, each with his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the
   night. But for my part, to recline upon that royal bed and sleep with
   Jesus' bosom for a pillow, is better still. I pray you, dear Friends,
   delight yourselves in Christ! Let your faith so taste Jesus as to make
   you glad. Let your joy be as the joy of harvest and sing with
   Zechariah, "How great is His goodness and how great is His beauty! Corn
   shall make the young men cheerful and new wine the maids." Better is
   Christ to you than all earth's harvests. He is the cluster of Eshcol,
   so heavy that one man can never carry all of Christ! He is not one
   grape. But a cluster of sweetness is our Beloved unto us!

   Feed to the full! Eat, yes, drink abundantly, O Beloved! Be satiated
   with delight, and let your soul rejoice as with marrow and fatness--so
   shall you understand in the fullest degree what this taste is which so
   delights the soul of man! King Solomon, during his lifetime, sat at a
   feast. The first rich course was one which he had asked for himself. It
   was wisdom. He tasted all its dainty morsels and he cried, "In much
   wisdom is much grief: and he that increases knowledge increases
   sorrow." Then an attendant, all bedecked with gold and silver, brought
   in the lordly dish of riches and Solomon ate thereof till he cried out,
   "All is vanity and vexation of spirit, there is no profit under the
   sun."

   Then there came in one who looked most bewitching, bearing the dish of
   carnal and fleshly pleasure and Solomon greedily sat down to eat--for
   this time, he thought--he had full sure obtained the honey that would
   enlighten his eyes. So Solomon feasted to the very full, and at the
   last he said, "vanity of vanities. All is vanity!" But he never would
   have said this concerning the true wisdom. For at the last, when the
   old man ceased to be a hunter of pleasure, he bore his willing
   testimony to the perfection of that love which is better than wine.

   Dearly Beloved, you who know what it is to taste Christ can witness
   that Immanuel's love makes you like Jonathan in the woods, who did but
   dip the end of his spear into the honey and his eyes were enlightened.
   Oh, what enlightenment, what joy, what consolation, what leaping of
   heart is there to that man who has learned to feed on Jesus, and on
   Jesus Christ alone!

   6. We must remark, dear Friends, that this taste of ours is in this
   life imperfect. As old master Durham says, "It is but a taste!" You
   have tasted that the Lord is gracious, but you do not know how good and
   how gracious He is. I am sure my soul was hot within me when you were
   singing that verse just now--

   "But when I see You as You are, I'll praise You as I ought"

   There is another verse, too, which I may aptly quote--

   "When I have tasted of the grapes, I sometimes long to go Where my dear
   Lord the vineyard keeps, And all the clusters grow."

   We have not yet rested beneath the vines of Canaan. We have only
   enjoyed the first fruits of the Spirit and they have set us hungering
   and thirsting for the fullness of the heavenly heritage. We groan
   within ourselves, waiting for the adoption. We are like David. We have
   had a draught of water from the well of Bethlehem that is within the
   gate, brought to us through the valor of Christ Jesus. But we have not
   yet drank the clear, cool stream, in all its perfection, at the
   fountain head.

   We are but beginners in spiritual education. We have learned the first
   letters of the alphabet. We cannot read words yet, much less can we
   read sentences--we are but infants. We have not come to the stature of
   perfect men in Christ Jesus. As one says, "He that has been in Heaven
   but five minutes, knows more than all the general assembly on earth,
   though they were all learned divines." We shall know more of Christ by
   one glimpse of Him in Heaven, than we shall know by all our learning
   here. It is but a taste here, and if a taste is so ravishing, what must
   it be to sit at the table and eat bread in the kingdom of God?

   And here I must again remark that this imperfection of taste is in some
   Christians far more conspicuous than in others. There are some
   Believers who seem to have no appreciating taste for Christ--they
   hardly know the savor of His blessed name. I declare to you all, if
   Christ were not better than the visible Church, we might be weary of
   Him. His Church, alas, is but the blurred and blotted portrait of
   Himself--lovely she is. But sometimes those blots and blurs are so
   conspicuous to our anxious eyes that we rather mourn her uncomeliness
   than rejoice over her beauty. Oh, how many there are among you,
   professors of Christ, that are none of His!

   What said the Apostle? "For many walk, of whom I have told you often
   and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cross
   of Christ: whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly and whose
   glory is in their shame." Dear Brethren, let us purge ourselves from
   the corruptions of these pretenders. Frivolity, pleasure, gain,
   worldliness, covetousness--what have these things to do with us? Get
   away from us! Get away from us! Be gone, you Fiends! But how many open
   their hearts and say, "Come, hide here, you unclean spirits. Come and
   dwell with us!"

   Surely, surely, surely, you have but little taste, if any, for the
   manna of Christ, or you would never eat the dust which is the serpent's
   meat. God quicken His people! Wash their mouths out, if necessary, even
   with bitter medicine, till they desire Christ anew and cleave to Him
   with full purpose of heart.

   7. Though ours is an imperfect, we thank God it is a growing taste. Old
   Barzillai told David that he was too old a man to enjoy dainties. Said
   he, "Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink?" We know that
   sometimes in the decline of life, the taste, like the other powers of
   manhood, decays. But glory be to God, a taste for Christ will never
   decay. The good bishop, when he was dying, was asked by his wife
   whether he knew her. But he shook his head, for memory had failed. His
   dearest friends and children, after repeating their names, asked
   whether their dear friend and father had not some recollection of them.
   But again he shook his head. "Do you remember Jesus?" said one. And oh,
   how he clasped his hands together, for that was a name he never could
   forget!

   Our venerable friends who are present with us this morning, find--I
   hope they do--that they have a loosened grip for the world and a
   tighter grasp for Christ. While your eyes grow dim and you need your
   glasses, I hope you can see Christ more clearly than ever. God grant
   that some of you may be called up to the top of Pisgah and may have a
   view of the landscape. And there may you see your Master's love in all
   the length and breadth of its fullness and richness, before yet you are
   raised up to Heaven by the kiss of the Most High. In dying moments, the
   Christian's taste gets quickened.

   And whereas before he thought Christ sweet, now he knows He is! Where
   he once compared Him to honey, now He declares that honey from the
   honeycomb is sour compared with Christ.

   And he can cry out with Rutherford, "Black heavens, black moon, black
   sun! But fair, fair, incomparably fair Lord Jesus!" He can now tread
   everything beneath his feet as he would a dead and corrupt thing. But
   his soul cries, "Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! You are brighter, fairer and more
   lovely to me than ever You were before!" God give us Grace that we may
   understand and know--experimentally---what it is to taste that the Lord
   is gracious.

   II. MEN WHO HAVE THUS TASTED OF CHRIST HAVE SPECIAL SINS TO AVOID AND
   OBJECTS TO DESIRE.

   We first dwell upon evils to be avoided. Malice. "Revenge is sweet," is
   the proverb of the Italians and many an Englishman has half learned it,
   if not wholly. "Revenge is sweet." But not to the man who has tasted
   Christ, for he says, "How can I have vengeance upon my fellow, when
   Christ has put away my sin?" Now, forgiveness is sweet and he loathes
   malice and turns aside from it as from venom itself.

   Guile--that is craftiness whereby men rob their fellow creatures. Some
   men think guile a very fine thing. "That's a sharp fellow," says one.
   And sage fathers pat their boys on the back and say, "If you become a
   sharp fellow you will be an alderman yet." See yonder trader, you must
   keep all your eyes open or he will take you in. He does not exactly
   tell lies but--well, he shaves very closely to the truth. It is
   guile--low craftiness and cunning. A man of God hates that thing.
   "What? I, I the servant of the God of Truth, crouch, bend, fawn, do
   anything but what is upright, to gain wealth?" As surely as the Lord
   says concerning the Laodicean Church, "I will spew you out of My
   mouth," so the Believer says concerning anything that is not true and
   straightforward, "I am sick of it. I loathe it, I abhor it. I turn from
   it."

   The next thing is hypocrisy, whereby men are not so much robbed and
   injured as deceived. A Christian can be no hypocrite. Hypocrisy, like
   all other sins, lurks in man till the very last. But a Believer hates
   to pretend to be what he is not. A man who has once tasted that the
   Lord is gracious, is a true and transparent man in his profession. If
   any suppose him to be better than he is, he does not wish to wear
   feathers that are not his own. He would not be glorified by another
   man's labors, nor build upon another man's foundation. Hypocrisy he
   utterly detests and would sooner die a pauper than live a pretender.
   Any man among you who has tasted that the Lord is gracious, will, I am
   sure, without my exhortation this morning, loathe all malice, guile and
   hypocrisy.

   Once more, put away all evil speaking. I am sorry to say that there are
   some, who I hope are Christians, who do not hate evil speaking. "Have
   you heard about Mrs. So-and-So?" I shall not mention names but there
   are fifty, perhaps a hundred, here, to whom it will apply. There is a
   little mischief in the village about Miss A, or Mr. B. And Mrs.
   Tittle-Tattle is up as early as possible and calls on Mrs. Scandal and
   says, "Have you heard the sad news? I hope it is not true." "No, I have
   not heard it." "Well, don't mention it to anybody else, I hope it is
   not correct. But I have heard such-and-such."

   And the two sit down and they make such a breakfast over it. And they
   both say they hope it is not true, while all the time they are as glad
   of it in their hearts as ever they can be. They go on telling others
   they hope it is not true--and telling them not to mention it to anybody
   else--until they do all the mischief before they have stopped to
   enquire whether or not they are telling lies. Then there are the men.
   They like a bit of scandal in the newspapers every now and then. Public
   men have often to feel that evil speaking must be very sweet to the
   people, or surely it would never pay to print such barefaced lies.

   A Christian should have nothing to do with scandal but should say in a
   company, "Stop! I cannot sit by and hear you say that of an absent
   person. If he were here, you might say what you liked, but as he is
   not, please hold your tongue, for I am here as a defender of those who
   are back-bitten." Every absent man should have an advocate in a
   Christian. More especially should this be true when the rumor injures a
   Brother or Sister in Christ. "It is an ill bird that fouls its own
   nest." And he is an ill Believer who tells tales about his fellow
   Christians.

   If you, as a Church member, have anything against a Brother, tell him
   alone. And then, if it should be some public and crying sin, tell it in
   an orderly manner to the Church officers. But for you to go chattering
   about things you do not know to be true is such an offense against
   Church order, that if you are expelled from Church communion for it,
   the ejection will be justifiable. You certainly cannot expect to have
   fellowship with Christ if you mar the fellowship of Christ's Church by
   talking the one against the other.

   See, now, among our different denominations, how pleased some ministers
   are if they can get a bone to pick against a Brother in another
   denomination. If there is a fresh hitch in the machinery of the Church
   of England, how often the Dissenter feels devoutly glad that there is
   likely to be an upsetting of the Episcopal communion. And I know that
   some Episcopalians, when they hear that in a Dissenting Church there is
   something wrong, say, "Well, it is a great pity." But they think to
   themselves, "Well, they will eat one another up and will be all the
   less trouble to us." Rinse your mouths! Rinse your mouths, all of you,
   who have said anything against your Brethren up to now and from this
   time forth. "If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious,"
   eschew all evil speaking against your fellow men.

   The Apostle, having told us what to avoid, tells us what to eat and
   drink. "As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word." A most
   unfortunate translation, for who ever heard of "sincere milk?"
   "Unadulterated milk" is a more sensible translation. The Christian man
   should desire pure doctrine. He should desire to hear the Gospel
   plainly and truthfully preached. Not in the words which man's wisdom
   teaches, but in the words which the Holy Spirit teaches. It is a sign
   of declining health in a Christian when he does not love the means of
   Divine Grace. "But how, Sir, if I cannot get on with my minister?"
   Well, it may be your sin that makes him such a poor minister as you
   think him to be.

   No doubt, while the pew is to be supplied by the pulpit, the pulpit is
   acted upon very greatly by the chilliness and hardness of the pew. If
   you prayed more for your minister you would feed better under him. But
   in London you have not this excuse, for there is such a choice of
   preachers of the Word here, that if you had a desire for the pure milk,
   you might obtain it somewhere or other. Oh, what a good thing it is to
   have spiritual hunger and thirst! When people are not hungry, you may
   set a fine meal before them, but they will turn up their noses at it.
   But let a man come fresh from the field, hungry--down he sits--no
   matter how rough the fare. He only wants it to be sweet, wholesome and
   nutritious, and he cuts huge slices for himself and feeds to the full.

   Give me a congregation of hungry hearers, such as I usually see here on
   Sunday, with eyes that seldom turn from the preacher and with ears that
   catch every word! I think any man could preach to my congregation, for
   you come up here hungry. A minister would wish to be like the mother
   bird which comes back with the worm to the nest and finds all the
   mouths open, everyone desiring to be fed. Now, this is just, I think,
   what the Apostle meant--"As newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
   the Word." You know babes do not have set times for desiring their
   food. When they want it they will have it and will cry till they get
   it.

   So should it be with Believers. They should have such unceremonious
   longings to be fed from the breasts of Heaven's consolation, that they
   will cry till they get the heavenly food from God their Father--that
   living food by which they grow and are made strong in Christ. I have
   thus enlarged upon the first part of the text. And now, two or three
   minutes only, upon the next. "O taste and see that the Lord is good!"

   Dear Christian Friends, I have spoken to you of this taste. But among
   us this morning, in the galleries and down below here, there is a
   goodly sprinkle of men who do not know Christ. They have come up to
   this House of Prayer, not that they might know Christ, but that they
   might see a vast congregation and amuse themselves by novelty. Ah, how
   many come with this miserable object. Well, let them come for whatever
   they like, we are glad to see them, for being in the way, God may meet
   with them.

   Now, to such of you who are not Believers in Christ and have never
   tasted that He is gracious, we say this-- "O taste and see." By which
   we mean, experience is necessary. Taste and see. You cannot see without
   tasting. If you would know whether religion is a good and happy thing,
   try it. It is not rubbing the bread upon the cheek. It is tasting. You
   must have an inward sense of the things of God. "My son, give Me your
   heart." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." Let
   your heart believe in Jesus. Be not content with ceremonies. Rest not
   satisfied with outward morality. Only that which reaches the core will
   really affect the fruit of the tree. We must make the fountain pure, or
   else our filtering the stream is all in vain. "Taste and see."

   Dear Hearers, I cannot insist too earnestly upon this. Get an inward
   religion--vital godliness--which goes into the secret parts of the
   heart and dwells in the inner man. Nothing but tasting can save your
   souls. And then we say, "Taste and see." We are quite sure that if you
   will taste you shall see that the Lord is good. I bear my willing
   witness that Christ makes a man blessed, that religion is a happy
   thing, and that "her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths
   are peace." But you do not believe me. Then taste and see for
   yourselves. "Seek the Lord while He may be found: call upon Him while
   He is near."

   May the Spirit of God lead you to give your heart to Jesus, and you
   will find that the true religion of Jesus is a good thing for you. A
   good thing for you, young woman. A good thing for you, young man. Good
   for the trader; good for the gentleman. Good for the artisan--good for
   everyone of you. We feel very earnest that you should do this and
   therefore we say, "O taste and see that the Lord is good!" Do not
   despise our invitation! We beseech you, by the mercies of God, to give
   your hearts to Jesus. From our very souls, as though we pleaded for our
   own lives, we would beseech you. Give the things of God a patient
   consideration. Believe in Jesus. This is to taste. Trust Christ. This
   is to "taste and see that the Lord is good."

   Yes, I know you will turn on your heels and say that religion is a good
   thing for Sundays but you do not see anything in it for everyday life.
   Ah, Sirs, it is for want of knowing better. If you would but taste and
   see, you would regret that you had not tasted before--and you would
   rejoice and bless the Lord that you were brought to taste at last. But
   you say, "May I taste?" Oh, yes! Divine Grace is free! Christ is free!
   If you will come, poor Sinner, there is none to push you back. If God
   has made you willing to take Christ, depend upon it, Christ was always
   willing to take you--for where God puts a renewed will into man, it is
   the image of His own eternal will. If you desire Christ, trust Him this
   morning. This is the way to escape from Hell and fly to Heaven.

   Are you black with sin? The fountain is open--wash. Are you hungry? The
   door is not shut. It stands open all day-- come, then, and eat. "Ho,
   everyone that thirsts, come you to the waters and he that has no money,
   come you, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and
   without price." If any of you should ever regret of trusting Christ,
   come and blame me. Find my Master in your hearts and if He is not a
   good and precious Savior to you, if He does not feed your soul with
   gladness, keep you from sin and bring you at last to Heaven--come and
   tell me I am found a false witness unto Christ! From the depths of my
   soul I say it, I would sooner be a Christian than an emperor; sooner
   have Christ than a crown. And sooner bear His Cross than sit upon the
   throne of a Caesar.

   Soul, taste and see that He is good. "But I am not fit to taste," says
   one. Well but who is fit to eat? A hungry man? Are you hungry? Eat. "Oh
   but my hands are black with sin." Never mind. It is not hand work here,
   it is mouth work. "Oh but I am afraid I have no taste and that if I did
   receive Christ into my heart, I should not taste His sweetness." Mark,
   the taste is in Him and not in your mouth. Come and take Him as he is.
   A little child, however weak, can be fed. Put up your mouth, you weak
   and foolish Sinner, weary and heavy laden as you are, and by receiving
   Christ into your soul's mouth, you shall find Him good, and you shall
   go your way rejoicing.

   Hearken diligently unto the Lord and eat that which is good and let
   your soul delight itself in fatness. It will be an awful thing to feed
   on the wind forever and roll the morsels of Hell beneath your tongue to
   all eternity--but this will be your portion unless you taste of Christ.
   May He add His own blessing to His own glory. Amen.

                        Faith and Repentance Inseparable

   A Sermon

   (No. 460)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, July 13th, 1862, by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Repent ye, and believe the gospel."--Mark 1:15

   Our Lord Jesus Christ commences his ministry by announcing its leading
   commands. He cometh up from the wilderness newly anointed, like the
   bridegroom from his chamber; his love notes are repentance and faith.
   He cometh forth fully prepared for his office, having been in the
   desert, "tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin"; his loins
   are girded like a strong man to run a race. He preacheth with all the
   earnestness of a new zeal, combined with all the wisdom of a long
   preparation; in the beauty of holiness from the womb of morning he
   glittereth with the dew of his youth. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O
   earth, for Messias speaketh in the greatness of his strength. He crieth
   unto the sons of men, "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." Let us give
   our ears to these words which, like their author, are full of grace and
   truth. Before us we have the sum and substance of Jesus Christ's whole
   teaching--the Alpha and Omega of his entire ministry; and coming from
   the lips of such an one, at such a time, with such peculiar power, let
   us give the most earnest heed, and may God help us to obey them from
   our inmost hearts.

   I. I shall commence my remarking that the gospel which Christ preached
   was, very plainly, a command. "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." Our
   Lord does condescend to reason. Often his ministry graciously acted out
   the old text, "Come, now, and let us reason together; though your sins
   be as scarlet, they shall be as wool." He does persuade men by telling
   and forcible arguments, which should lead them to seek the salvation of
   their souls. He does invite men, and oh, how lovingly he woos them to
   be wise. "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest." He does entreat men; he condescendeth to become,
   as it were, a beggar to his own sinful creatures, beseeching them to
   come to him. Indeed, he maketh this to be the duty of his ministers,
   "As though God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christ's stead,
   be ye reconciled to God." Yet, remember, though he condescendeth to
   reason, to persuade, to invite, and to beseech, still his gospel hath
   in it all the dignity and force of a command; and if we would preach it
   in these days as Christ did, we must proclaim it as a command from God,
   attended with a divine sanction, and not to be neglected save at the
   infinite peril of the soul. When the feast was spread upon the table
   for the marriage-supper, there was an invitation, but it had all the
   obligation of a command, since those who rejected it were utterly
   destroyed as despisers of their king. When the builders reject Christ,
   he becomes a stone of stumbling to "the disobedient"; but how could
   they disobey if there were no command? The gospel contemplates, I say,
   invitations, entreaties, and beseechings, but it also takes the higher
   ground of authority. "Repent ye" is as much a command of God as "Thou
   shalt not steal." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ" has as fully a
   divine authority as "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   heart, with all thy soul, with all thy strength." Think not, O men,
   that the gospel is a thing left to your option to choose it or not!
   Dream not, O sinners, that ye may despise the Word from heaven and
   incur no guilt! Think not that ye may neglect it and no ill
   consequences shall follow! It is just this neglect and despising of
   yours which shall fill up the measure of your iniquity. It is this
   concerning which we cry aloud, "How shall we escape if we neglect so
   great a salvation!" God commands you to repent. The same God before
   whom Sinai was moved and was altogether on a smoke--that same God who
   proclaimed the law with sound of trumpet, with lightnings and with
   thunders, speaketh to us more gently, but still as divinely, through
   his only begotten Son, when he saith to us, "Repent ye, and believe the
   gospel."

   Why is this, dear friends; why has the Lord made it a command to us to
   believe in Christ? There is a blessed reason. Many souls would never
   venture to believe at all if it were not made penal to refuse to do so.
   For this is the difficulty with many awakened sinners: may I believe?
   Have I a right to believe? Am I permitted to trust Christ? Now this
   question is put aside, once for all, and should never irritate a broken
   heart again. You are commanded by God to do it, therefore you may do
   it. Every creature under heaven is commanded to believe in the Lord
   Jesus, and bow the knee at his name; every creature, wherever the
   gospel comes, wherever the truth is preached, is commanded there and
   then to believe the gospel; and it is put in that shape, I say, least
   any conscience-stricken sinner should question whether he may do it.
   Surely, you may do what God commands you to do. You may know this in
   the devil's teeth--"I may do it; I am bidden to do it by him who hath
   authority, and I am threatened if I do not with eternal damnation from
   his presence, for 'he that believeth not shall be damned.'" This gives
   the sinner such a blessed permit, that whatever he may be or may not
   be, whatever he may have felt or may not have felt, he has a warrant
   which he may use whenever he is led to approach the cross. However
   benighted and darkened you may be, however hard-hearted and callous you
   may be, you have still a warrant to look to Jesus in the words, "Look
   unto me and be ye saved all ye ends of the earth." He that commanded
   thee to believe will justify thee in believing; he cannot condemn thee
   for that which he himself bids thee do. But while there is this blessed
   reason for the gospel's being a command, there is yet another solemn
   and an awful one. It is that men may be without excuse in the day of
   judgment; that no man may say at the last, "Lord, I did not know that I
   might believe in Christ; Lord, heaven's gate was shut in my face; I was
   told that I might not come, that I was not the man." "Nay," saith the
   Lord, with tones of thunder, "the times of man's ignorance I winked at,
   but in the gospel I commanded all men everywhere to repent; I sent my
   Son, and then I sent my apostles, and afterwards my ministers, and I
   bade them all make this the burden of their cry, 'Repent and be
   converted everyone of you'; and as Peter preached at Pentecost, so bade
   I them preach to thee. I bade them warn, exhort, and invite with all
   affection, but also to command with all authority, compelling you to
   come in, and inasmuch as you did not come at my command, you have added
   sin to sin; you have added the suicide of your own soul to all your
   other iniquities; and now, inasmuch as you did reject my Son, you shall
   have the portion of unbelievers, for 'he that believeth not shall be
   damned.'" To all the nations of the earth, then, let us sound forth
   this decree from God. O men, Jehovah that made you, he who gives you
   the breath of your nostrils, he against whom you have offended,
   commands you this day to repent and believe the gospel. He gives his
   promise--"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved"; and he
   adds the solemn threatening--"He that believeth not shall be damned." I
   know some brethren will not like this, but that I cannot help. The
   slave of systems I will never be, for the Lord has loosed this iron
   bondage from my neck, and now I am the joyful servant of the truth
   which maketh free. Offend or please, as God shall help me, I will
   preach every truth as I learn it from the Word; and I know if there be
   anything written in the Bible at all it is written as with a sunbeam,
   that God in Christ commandeth men to repent, and believe the gospel. It
   is one of the saddest proofs of man's utter depravity that he will not
   obey this command, but that he will despise Christ, and so make his
   doom worse than the doom of Sodom and Gomorrah. Without the
   regenerating work of God the Holy Ghost, no man ever will be obedient
   to this command, but still it must be published for a witness against
   them if they reject it; and while publishing God's command with all
   simplicity, we may expect that he will divinely enforce it in the souls
   of those whom he has ordained unto eternal life.

   II. While the gospel is a command, it is a two-fold command explaining
   itself. "Repent ye, and believe the gospel."

   I know some very excellent brethren--would God there were more like
   them in zeal and love--who, in their zeal to preach up simple faith in
   Christ have felt a little difficulty about the matter of repentance;
   and I have known some of them who have tried to get over the difficulty
   by softening down the apparent hardness of the word repentance, by
   expounding it according to its more usual Greek equivalent, a word
   which occurs in the original of my text, and signifies "to change one's
   mind." Apparently they interpret repentance to be a somewhat slighter
   thing than we usually conceive it to be, a mere change of mind, in
   fact. Now, allow me to suggest to those dear brethren, that the Holy
   Ghost never preaches repentance as a trifle; and the change of mind or
   understanding of which the gospel speaks is a very deep and solemn
   work, and must not on any account be depreciated. Moreover, there is
   another word which is also used in the original Greek for repentance,
   not so often I admit, but still is used, which signifies "an
   after-care," a word which has in it something more of sorrow and
   anxiety, than that which signifies changing one's mind. There must be
   sorrow for sin and hatred of it in true repentance, or else I have read
   my Bible to little purpose. In very truth, I think there is no
   necessity for any other definition than that of the children's hymn--

   "Repentance is to leave

   The sins we loved before,

   And show that we in earnest grieve,

   By doing so no more."

   To repent does mean a change of mind; but then it is a thorough change
   of the understanding and all that is in the mind, so that it includes
   an illumination, an illumination of the Holy Spirit; and I think it
   includes a discovery of iniquity and a hatred of it, without which
   there can hardly be a genuine repentance. We must not, I think,
   undervalue repentance. It is a blessed grace of God the Holy Spirit,
   and it is absolutely necessary unto salvation.

   The command explains itself. We will take, first of all, repentance. It
   is quite certain that whatever the repentance here mentioned may be, it
   is a repentance perfectly consistent with faith; and therefore we get
   the explanation of what repentance must be, from its being connected
   with the next command, "Believe the gospel." Then, dear friends, we may
   be sure that that unbelief which leads a man to think that his sin is
   too great for Christ to pardon it, is not the repentance meant here.
   Many who truly repent are tempted to believe that they are too great
   sinners for Christ to pardon. That, however, is not part of their
   repentance; it is a sin, a very great and grievous sin, for it is
   undervaluing the merit of Christ's blood; it is a denial of the
   truthfulness of God's promise; it is a detracting from the grace and
   favour of God who sent the gospel. Such a persuasion you must labour to
   get rid of, for it came from Satan, and not from the Holy Spirit. God
   the Holy Ghost never did teach a man that his sins were too great to be
   forgiven, for that would be to make God the Holy Spirit to teach a lie.
   If any of you have a thought of that kind this morning, be rid of it;
   it cometh from the powers of darkness, and not from the Holy Ghost; and
   if some of you are troubled because you never were haunted by that
   fear, be glad instead of being troubled. He can save you; be you as
   black as hell he can save you; and it is a wicked falsehood, and a high
   insult against the high majesty of divine love when you are tempted to
   believe that you are past the mercy of God. That is not repentance, but
   a foul sin against the infinite mercy of God.

   Then, there is another spurious repentance which makes the sinner dwell
   upon the consequences of his sin, rather than upon the sin itself, and
   so keeps him from believing. I have known some sinners so distressed
   with fears of hell, and thoughts of death and of eternal judgment, that
   to use the words of one terrible preacher, "They have been shaken over
   the mouth of hell by their collar," and have felt the torments of the
   pit before they went thither. Dear friends, this is not repentance.
   Many a man has felt all that and has yet been lost. Look at many a
   dying man, tormented with remorse, who has had all its pangs and
   convictions, and yet has gone down to the grave without Christ and
   without hope. These things may come with repentance, but, they are not
   an essential part of it. That which is called law-work, in which the
   sinner is terrified with horrible thoughts that God's mercy is gone for
   ever, may be permitted by God for some special purpose, but it is not
   repentance; in fact, it may often be devilish rather than heavenly,
   for, as John Bunyan tells us, Diabolus doth often beat the great
   hell-drum in the ears of the men of Mansoul, to prevent their hearing
   the sweet trumpet of the gospel which proclaimeth pardon to them. I
   tell thee, sinner, any repentance that keeps thee from believing in
   Christ is a repentance that needs to be repented of; any repentance
   that makes thee think Christ will not save thee, goes beyond the truth
   and against the truth, and the sooner thou are rid of it the better.
   God deliver thee from it, for the repentance that will save thee is
   quite consistent with faith in Christ.

   There is, again, a false repentance which leads men to hardness of
   heart and despair. We have known some seared as with a hot iron by
   burning remorse. They have said, "I have done much evil; there is no
   hope for me; I will not hear the Word any more." If they hear it it is
   nothing to them, their hearts are hard as adamant. If they could once
   get the thought that God would forgive them, their hearts would flow in
   rivers of repentance; but no; they feel a kind of regret that they did
   wrong, but yet they go on in it all the same, feeling that there is no
   hope, and that they may as well continue to live as they were wont to
   do, and get the pleasures of sin since they cannot, as they think, have
   the pleasures of grace. Now, that is no repentance. It is a fire which
   hardens, and not the Lord's fire which melts; it may be a hammer, but
   it is a hammer used to knit the particles of your soul together, and
   not to break the heart. If, dear friends, you have never been the
   subject of these terrors do not desire them. Thank God if you have been
   brought to Jesus any how, but long not for needless horrors. Jesus
   saves you, not by what you feel, but by that finished work, that blood
   and righteousness which God accepted on your behalf. Do remember that
   no repentance is worth having which is not perfectly consistent with
   faith in Christ. An old saint, on his sick-bed, once used this
   remarkable expression; "Lord, sink me low as hell in repentance;
   but"--and here is the beauty of it--"lift me high as heaven in faith."
   Now, the repentance that sinks a man low as hell is of no use except
   there is faith also that lifts him as high as heaven, and the two are
   perfectly consistent one with the other. A man may loathe and detest
   himself, and all the while he may know that Christ is able to save, and
   has saved him. In fact, this is how true Christians live; they repent
   as bitterly as for sin as if they knew they should be damned for it;
   but they rejoice as much in Christ as if sin were nothing at all. Oh,
   how blessed it is to know where these two lines meet, the stripping of
   repentance, and the clothing of faith! The repentance that ejects sin
   as an evil tenant, and the faith which admits Christ to be the sole
   master of the heart; the repentance which purges the soul from dead
   works, and the faith that fills the soul with living works; the
   repentance which pulls down, and the faith which builds up; the
   repentance that scatters stones, and the faith which puts stones
   together; the repentance which ordains a time to weep, and the faith
   that gives a time to dance-- these two things together make up the work
   of grace within, whereby men's souls are saved. Be it, then laid down
   as a great truth, most plainly written in our text, that the repentance
   we ought to preach is one connected with faith, and thus we may preach
   repentance and faith together without any difficulty whatever.

   Having shown you what this repentance is not, let us dwell for a moment
   on what it is. The repentance which is here commanded is the result of
   faith; it is born at the same time with faith--they are twins, and to
   say which is the elder-born passes my knowledge. It is a great mystery;
   faith is before repentance in some of its acts, and repentance before
   faith in another view of it; the fact being that they come into the
   soul together. Now, a repentance which makes me weep and abhor my past
   life because of the love of Christ which has pardoned it, is the right
   repentance. When I can say, "My sin is washed away by Jesu's blood,"
   and then repent because I so sinned as to make it necessary that Christ
   should die--that dove-eyed repentance which looks at his bleeding
   wounds, and feels that her heart must bleed because she wounded
   Christ--that broken heart that breaks because Christ was nailed to the
   cross for it--that is the repentance which bringeth us salvation.

   Again, the repentance which makes us avoid present sin because of the
   love of God who died for us, this also is saving repentance. If I avoid
   sin to-day because I am afraid of being lost if I commit it, I have not
   the repentance of a child of God; but when I avoid it and seek to lead
   a holy life because Christ loved me and gave himself up for me, and
   because I am not my own, but am bought with a price, this is the work
   of the Spirit of God.

   And again, that change of mind, that after-carefulness which leads me
   to resolve that in future I will live like Jesus, and will not live
   unto the lusts of the flesh, because he hath redeemed me, not with
   corruptible things as silver and gold, but with his own precious
   blood--that is the repentance which will save me, and the repentance he
   asks of me. O ye nations of the earth, he asks not the repentance of
   Mount Sinai, while ye do fear and shake because his lightnings are
   abroad; but he asks you to weep and wail because of him; to look on him
   whom you have pierced, and to mourn for him as a man mourneth for his
   only son; he bids you remember that you nailed the Saviour to the tree,
   and asks that this argument may make you hate the murderous sins which
   fastened the Saviour there, and put the Lord of glory to an ignominious
   and an accursed death. This is the only repentance we have to preach;
   not law and terrors; not despair; not driving men to self-murder--this
   is the terror of the world which worketh death; but godly sorrow is a
   sorrow unto salvation though Jesus Christ our Lord.

   This brings me to the second half of the command, which is, "Believe
   the gospel." Faith means trust in Christ. Now, I must again remark that
   some have preached this trust in Christ so well and so fully, that I
   can admire their faithfulness and bless God for them; yet there is a
   difficulty and a danger; it may be that in preaching simple trust in
   Christ as being the way of salvation, that they omit to remind the
   sinner that no faith can be genuine but such as is perfectly consistent
   with repentance for past sin; for my text seems to me to put it thus:
   no repentance is true but that which consorts with faith; no faith is
   true but that which is linked with a hearty and sincere repentance on
   account of past sin. So then, dear friends, those people who have a
   faith which allows them to think lightly of past sin, have the faith of
   devils, and not the faith of God's elect. Those who say, "Oh, as for
   the past, that is nothing; Jesus Christ has washed all that away"; and
   can talk about all the crimes of their youth, and the iniquitous of
   their riper years, as if they were mere trifles, and never think of
   shedding a tear; never feel their souls ready to burst because they
   should have been such great offenders--such men who can trifle with the
   past, and even fight their battles o'er again when their passions are
   too cold for new rebellions--I say that such who think sin a trifle and
   have never sorrowed on account of it, may know that their faith is not
   genuine. Such men as have a faith which allows them to live carelessly
   in the present who say, "Well, I am saved by a simple faith"; and then
   sit on the ale-bench with the drunkard, or stand at the bar with the
   spirit-drinker, or go into worldly company and enjoy the carnal
   pleasures and the lusts of the flesh, such men are liars; they have not
   the faith which will save the soul. They have a deceitful hypocrisy;
   they have not the faith which will bring them to heaven.

   And then, there be some other people who have a faith which leads them
   to no hatred of sin. They do not look upon sin in others with any kind
   of shame. It is true they would not do as others do, but then they can
   laugh at what others commit. They take pleasure in the vices of others;
   laugh at their profane jests, and smile at their loose speeches. They
   do not flee from sin as from a serpent, nor detest it as the murderer
   of their best friend. No, they dally with it; they make excuses for it;
   they commit in private what in public they condemn. They call grave
   offences slight faults and little defalcations; and in business they
   wink at departures from uprightness, and consider them to be mere
   matters of trade; the fact being that they have a faith which will sit
   down arm-in-arm with sin, and eat and drink at the same table with
   unrighteousness. Oh! if any of you have such a faith as this, I pray
   God to turn it out bag and baggage. It is of no good to you; the sooner
   you are cleaned out of it the better for you, for when this sandy
   foundation shall all be washed away, perhaps you may then begin to
   build upon the rock. My dear friends, I would be very faithful with
   your souls, and would lay the lancet at each man's heart. What is your
   repentance? Have you a repentance that leads you to look out of self to
   Christ, and to Christ only? On the other hand, have you that faith
   which leads you to true repentance; to hate the very thought of sin; so
   that the dearest idol you have known, whatever it may be, you desire to
   tear from its throne that you may worship Christ, and Christ only? Be
   assured of this, that nothing short of this will be of any use to you
   at the last. A repentance and a faith of any other sort may do to
   please you now, as children are pleased with fancies; but when you get
   on a death-bed, and see the reality of things, you will be compelled to
   say that they are a falsehood and a refuge of lies. You will find that
   you have been daubed with untempered mortar; that you have said,
   "Peace, peace," to yourselves, when there was no peace. Again, I say,
   in the words of Christ, "Repent and believe the gospel." Trust Christ
   to save you, and lament that you need to be saved, and mourn because
   this need of yours has put the Saviour to open shame, to frightful
   sufferings, and to a terrible death.

   III. But we must pass on to a third remark. These commands of Christ
   are of the most reasonable character.

   Is it an unreasonable thing to demand of a man that he should repent?
   You have a person who has offended you; you are ready to forgive him;
   do you think it is at all exacting or overbearing if you ask of him an
   apology; if you merely ask him, as the very least thing he can do, to
   acknowledge that he has done wrong? "No," say you, "I should think I
   showed my kindness in accepting rather than any harshness in demanding
   an apology from him." So God, against whom we have rebelled, who is our
   liege sovereign and monarch, seeth it to be inconsistent with the
   dignity of his kingship to absolve an offender who expresseth no
   contrition; and I say again, is this a harsh, exacting, unreasonable
   command? Doth God in this mode act like Solomon, who made the taxes of
   his people heavy? Rather doth he not ask of you that which your heart,
   if it were in a right state, would be but too willing to give, only too
   thankful that the Lord in his grace has said, "He that confesseth his
   sin shall find mercy"? Why, dear friends, do you expect to be saved
   while you are in your sins? Are you to be allowed to love your
   iniquities, and yet go to heaven? What, you think to have poison in
   your veins, and yet be healthy? What, man, keep the thief in doors, and
   yet be acquitted of dishonesty? Be stained, and yet be thought
   spotless? Harbour the disease and yet be in health? Ridiculous! Absurd!
   Repentance is founded on the necessity of things. The demand for a
   change of heart is absolutely necessary; it is but a reasonable
   service. O that men were reasonable, and they would repent; it is
   because they are not reasonable that it needs the Holy Spirit to teach
   their reason right reason before they will repent and believe the
   gospel.

   And then, again, believing; is that an unreasonable thing to ask of
   you? For a creature to believe its Creator is but a duty; altogether
   apart from the promise of salvation, I say, God has a right to demand
   of the creature that he has made, that he should believe what he tells
   him. And what is it he asks you to believe? Anything hideous,
   contradictory, irrational? It may be above reason, but it is not
   contrary to reason. He asks you to believe that through the blood of
   Jesus Christ, he can still be just, and yet the justifier of the
   ungodly. He asks you to trust in Christ to save you. Can you expect
   that he will save you if you will not trust him? Have you really the
   hardihood to think that he will carry you to heaven while all the while
   you declare he cannot do it? Do you think it consistent with the
   dignity of a Saviour to save you while you say, "I do not believe thou
   art a Saviour, and I will not trust thee"? Is it consistent with his
   dignity for him to save you, and suffer you to remain an unbelieving
   sinner, doubting his grace, mistrusting his love, slandering his
   character, doubting the efficacy of his blood, and of his plea? Why,
   man, it is the most reasonable thing in the world that he should demand
   of thee that thou shouldst believe in Christ. And this he doth demand
   of thee this morning. "Repent and believe the gospel." O friends, O
   friends, how sad, how sad is the state of man's soul when he will not
   do this! We may preach to you, but you never will repent and believe
   the gospel. We may lay God's command, like an axe, to the root of the
   tree, but, reasonable as these commands are, you will still refuse to
   give God his due; you will go on in your sins; you will not come unto
   him that you may have life; and it is here the Spirit of God must come
   in to work in the souls of the elect to make them willing in the day of
   his power. But oh! in God's name I warn you that, if, after hearing
   this command, you do, as I know you will do, without his Spirit,
   continue to refuse obedience to so reasonable a gospel, you shall find
   at the last it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah, than for
   you; for had the things which are preached in London been proclaimed in
   Sodom and Gomorrah, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
   in ashes. Woe unto you, inhabitants of London! Woe unto you, subjects
   of the British Empire! for if the truths which have been declared in
   your streets had been preached to Tyre and Sidon, they would have
   continued even unto this day.

   IV. But still, to pass on, I have yet a fourth remark to make, and that
   is, this is a command which demands immediate obedience. I do not know
   how it is, let us preach as we may, we cannot lead others to think that
   there is any great alarm, that there is any reason why they should
   think about their souls now. Last night there was a review on Wimbledon
   Common, and living not very far away from it, I could hear in one
   perpetual roll the cracks of the rifles and the thunder of cannon. One
   remarked to me, "Supposing there really were war there, we should not
   sit quite so comfortably in our room with our window open, listening to
   all this noise." No; and so when people come to chapel, they hear a
   sermon about repentance and faith; they listen to it. "What do you
   think of it?" "Oh--very well." But suppose it were real; suppose they
   believed it to be real, would they sit quite so comfortably? Would they
   be quite so easy? Ah, no! But you do not think it is real. You do not
   think that the God who made you actually asks of you this day that you
   should repent and believe. Yes, sirs, but it is real, and it is your
   procrastination, it is your self-confidence that is the sham, the
   bubble that is soon to burst. God's demand is the solemn reality, and
   if you could but hear it as it should be heard you would escape from
   your lives and flee for refuge to the hope that is set before you in
   the gospel, and you would do this to-day. This is the command of
   Christ, I say, to-day. To-day is God's time. "To-day if ye will hear
   his voice, harden not your heart, as in the provocation." "To-day," the
   gospel always cries, for if it tolerated sin a single day, it were an
   unholy gospel. If the gospel told men to repent of sin to-morrow, it
   would give them an allowance to continue in it to-day, and that would
   indeed be to pander to men's lusts. But the gospel maketh a clean sweep
   of sin, and demandeth of man that he should throw down the weapons of
   his rebellion now. Down with them, man! every one of them. Down, sir,
   down with them, and down with them now! You must not keep one of them;
   throw them down at once! The gospel challengeth him that he believe in
   Jesus now. So long as thou continuest in unbelief thou continuest in
   sin, and art increasing thy sin; and to give thee leave to be an
   unbeliever for an hour, were to pander to thy lusts; therefore it
   demandeth of thee faith, and faith now, for this is God's time, and the
   time which holiness must demand of a sinner. Besides, sinner, it is thy
   time. This is the only time thou canst call thine own. To-morrow! Is
   there such a thing? In what calendar is it written save in the almanack
   of the fool? To-morrow! Oh, how hast thou ruined multitudes!
   "To-morrow," say men; but like the hind-wheel of a chariot, they are
   always near to the front-wheel, always near to their duty; they still
   go on, and on, but never get one whit the nearer, for, travel as they
   may, to-morrow is still a little beyond them--but a little, and so they
   never come to Christ at all. This is how they speak, as an ancient poet
   said--

   "'I will to-morrow, that I will, I will be sure to do it';

   To-morrow comes, to-morrow goes, And still thou art 'to do it';

   Thus, then, repentance is deferred from one day to another,

   Until the day of death is one, And judgment is the other."

   O sons of men, always to be blessed, to be obedient, but never
   obedient, when will ye learn to be wise? This is your only time; it is
   God's time, and this is the best time. You will never find it easier to
   repent than now; you will never find it easier to believe than now. It
   is impossible now except the Spirit of God be with you; it will be as
   impossible to-morrow; but if now you would believe and repent, the
   Spirit of God is in the gospel which I preach; and while I cry out to
   thee in God's name, "Repent and believe," he that bade me command you
   thus to do gives power with the command, that even as Christ spake to
   the waves and said, "Be still," and they were still, and to the winds,
   "Be calm,", and they were quiet, so when we speak to your proud heart
   it yields because of the grace that accompanies the word, and you
   repent and believe the gospel. So may it be, and may the message of
   this morning gather out the elect, and make them willing in the day of
   God's power.

   But now, lastly, this command, while it has an immediate power, has
   also a continual force. "Repent ye, and believe the gospel," is advice
   to the young beginner, and it is advice to the old grey-headed
   Christian, for this is our life all the way through--"Repent ye, and
   believe the gospel." St. Anselm, who was a saint--and that is more than
   many of them were who were called so--St. Anselm once cried out "Oh!
   sinner that I have been, I will spend all the rest of my life in
   repenting of my whole life!" And Rowland Hill, whom I think I might
   call St. Rowland, when he was near death, said he had one regret, and
   that was that a dear friend who had lived with him for sixty years
   would have to leave him at the gate of heaven. "That dear friend," said
   he, "is repentance; repentance has been with me all my life, and I
   think I shall drop a tear," said the good man, "as I go through the
   gates, to think that I can repent no more." Repentance is the daily and
   hourly duty of a man who believes in Christ; and as we walk by faith
   from the wicket gate to the celestial city, so our right-hand companion
   all the journey through must be repentance. Why, dear friend, the
   Christian man, after he is saved, repents more than he ever did before,
   for now he repents not merely of overt deeds, but even of imaginations.
   He will take himself to task at night, and chide himself because he had
   tolerated one foul thought; because he has looked on vanity, though
   perhaps the heart had gone no further than the look of lust; because
   the thought of evil has flitted through the mind--for all this he will
   vex himself before God; and were it not that he still continues to
   believe the gospel, one foul imagination would be such a plague and
   sting to him, that he would have no peace and rest. When temptation
   comes to him the good man finds the use of repentance, for having hated
   sin and fled from it of old, he has ceased to be what he once was. One
   of the ancient fathers, we are told, had, before his conversion, lived
   with an ill woman, and some little time after, she accosted him as
   usual. Knowing how likely he was to fall into sin he ran away with all
   his might, and she ran after him, crying, "Wherefore runnest thou away?
   It is I." He answered, "I run away because I am not I; I am a new man."
   Now, it is just that, "I am not I," which keeps the Christian out of
   sin; that hating of the former "I," that repenting of the old sin that
   maketh him run from evil, abhor it, and look not upon it, lest by his
   eyes he should be led into sin. Dear friend, the more the Christian man
   knows of Christ's love, the more will he hate himself to think that he
   has sinned against such love. Every doctrine of the gospel will make a
   Christian man repent. Election, for instance. "How could I sin," saith
   he. "I that was God's favourite, chosen of him from before the
   foundation of the world?" Final perseverance will make him repent. "How
   can I sin," says he, "that am loved so much and kept so surely? How can
   I be so villainous as to sin against everlasting mercy?" Take any
   doctrine you please, the Christian will make it a fount for sacred woe;
   and there are times when his faith in Christ will be so strong that his
   repentance will burst its bonds, and will cry with George Herbert--

   "Oh, who will give me tears?

   Come, all ye springs,

   Ye clouds and rain dwell in my eyes,

   My grief hath need of all the wat'ry things

   That nature hath produc'd. Let ev'ry vein

   Suck up a river to supply mine eyes,

   My weary weeping eyes; too dry for me,

   Unless they set new conduits, new supplies

   To bear them out, and with my state agree."

   And all this is because he murdered Christ; because his sin nailed the
   Saviour to the tree; and therefore he weepeth and mourneth even to his
   life's end. Sinning, repenting, and believing--these are three things
   that will keep with us till we die. Sinning will stop at the river
   Jordan; repentance will die triumphing over the dead body of sin; and
   faith itself, though perhaps it may cross the stream, will cease to be
   so needful as it has been here, for there we shall see even as we are
   seen, and shall know even as we are known.

   I send you away when I have once again solemnly declared my Master's
   will to you this morning, "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." Here are
   some of you come from foreign countries, and many of you are from our
   provincial towns in England; you came here, perhaps, to hear the
   preacher of whom many a strange thing has been said. Well and good, and
   may stranger things still be said if they will but bring men under the
   sound of the Word that they may be blessed. Now, this I have to say to
   you this morning: In that great day when a congregation ten thousand
   times larger than this shall be assembled, and on the great white
   throne the Judge shall sit, there will be not a man, or woman, or
   child, who is here this morning, able to make excuse and say, "I did
   not hear the gospel; I did not know what I must do to be saved!" You
   have heard it: "Repent ye, and believe the gospel." That is, trust
   Christ; believe that he is able and willing to save you. But there is
   something better. In that great day, I say, there will be some of you
   present--oh! let us hope all of us--who will be able to say, "Thank God
   that ever I yielded up the weapons of my proud rebellion by repentance;
   thank God that I looked to Christ, and took him to be my Saviour from
   first to last; for here am I, a monument of grace, a sinner saved by
   blood, to praise him while time and eternity shall last!" God grant
   that we may meet each other at the last with joy and not with grief! I
   will be a swift witness against you to condemn you if you believe not
   this gospel; but if you repent and believe, then we shall praise that
   grace which turned our hearts, and so gave us the repentance which led
   us to trust Christ, and the faith which is the effectual gift of the
   Holy Spirit. What shall I say more unto you? Wherefore, wherefore will
   you reject this? If I have spoken to you of fables, of fictions, of
   dreams, then turn on your heel and reject my discourse. If I have
   spoken in my own name, who am I that you should care one whit for me?
   But if I have preached that which Christ preached, "Repent ye, and
   believe the gospel," I charge you by the living God, I charge you by
   the world's Redeemer, I charge you by cross of Calvary, and by the
   blood which stained the dust at Golgotha, obey this divine message and
   you shall have eternal life; but refuse it, and on your heads be your
   blood for ever and ever!

                            Am I Clear Of His Blood?

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 20, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from the ground."

   Genesis 4:10.

   CAIN was of the Wicked One and slew his brother. "The way of Cain" is
   not hard to describe. He is too proud to offer atonement for his sin.
   He prefers his own way of sacrifice. He presents a bloodless oblation.
   He hates the obedience of faith. He smites the faithful Abel. Beware of
   the way of Cain, O proud self-righteous ones, lest you run therein, for
   the steps are few from self-righteous pride to hatred of true Believers
   and murder is not far thereafter. There is the seed of every infamy in
   the proud spirit of self-justification, and it is a great mercy that it
   does not more often show itself in all its terrific ripeness.

   Look, bold boasters of your own merits, at the mangled body of the
   first martyr, for this is the full-blown development of your rebellious
   self-conceit. From all pride and vainglory, from all self-righteousness
   and hatred of the Cross of Christ, good Lord deliver us.

   This is not, however, the drift of my discourse this morning. I have
   rather to indicate the method in which we also may be guilty of this
   sin of blood-guiltiness concerning our brother.

   Dear Friends, I feel assured that the text of this morning, terrible as
   it must have been in the ears of Cain, ought to ring in your ears, and
   mine. And it may be that while that cry is heard again, though at the
   distance of many thousand years, it may awaken some here present to a
   sense of guilt, and to a desire for amendment. And thus the blood of
   Abel may speak good, though terrible things to them, and prepare their
   ears to listen to the voice of that other blood, "which speaks better
   things than that of Abel."

   First, we shall this morning enquire for the criminals whose brother's
   blood cries from the ground. Next, we will endeavor to show the hateful
   character of the crime. Then, thirdly, we will select the judgment. And
   fourthly, we will exhort the guilty ones to turn from their ways and to
   hear the voice of mercy.

   I. First, then, we are to MAKE A SEARCHING ENQUIRY FOR THE CRIMINALS.

   I do not intend to say much, this morning, about the act of actually
   slaying one's brother. The question of the right-ness of war is a moot
   point even among moral men. Among those who read their Bibles, the
   allowance of defensive war may, perhaps, still be a question. But any
   other sort of war must certainly be condemned by the man who is a
   disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ. We shall say nothing, however, or
   but very little, concerning the criminality of those ambitious and
   unscrupulous persons who hurry nations into war without cause.

   Lust of dominion and a false pride are setting the United States on a
   blaze. I know at this time a tragic incident connected with the present
   war in America. Four brothers left one of our villages in Oxfordshire,
   two of whom, if now alive, are in one army and two of them in the
   other. And, I doubt not, as desperately as any of their comrades, they
   are thirsting for each other's blood. What horrors cluster around the
   iniquity of civil war. On yonder soil it is the blood of brothers that
   cries from the ground. Men are fighting, one against the other, in this
   lamentable conflict for no justifiable cause. The one cause which
   justified the war, as we thought--the snapping of the fetters of the
   slave--is gone. Emancipation is not proclaimed, the slave is forgotten.

   What might have been a struggle for the rights of man is now a shameful
   and abominable slaughter of brothers by brothers. And a cry is going up
   to Heaven from those blood-red fields which God will hear, and will yet
   avenge on both sides. Oh that they would sheathe their swords and end
   it once and for all! What matters it if there are two nations or one?
   Better two in peace, than one divided with intestine strife! How much
   better to have even twenty nations of living men, than one nation of
   mangled corpses! What difference is it to the survivors if they have
   all the honor and dignity of conquerors, when they are stained up to
   their elbows in the blood of their fellow men?

   Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, "Consider your ways." Arise, you
   that draw your sword against your fellows and weep like the weeping of
   Ramah of old, and make your cities like Bochim, because of your
   iniquities! Go back to your homes in peace, beat your swords into
   plowshares, and your spears into pruning hooks, for Jehovah will have
   none of them. He casts out your armies like dung upon the field because
   every man of you smites his kinsman and his fellow!

   That, however, is not my subject this morning. May God grant that
   whatever may come of this terrible struggle, His name may be glorified.
   At present I see nothing but a carnival of madmen--Hell let loose. And
   I fear that an evil demon has deceived both nations, and made them like
   ravening wolves and roaring lions.

   I have to deal with you, however and not with those across the ocean.
   Let us come, therefore, to the point. There are many persons whose
   brother's blood cries to God from the ground. There is the seducer. He
   spoke with honeyed words and talked of love, but the poison of asps was
   under his tongue, for lust was in his heart. He came to a fair temple
   as a worshipper, but he committed infamous sacrilege and left that to
   be the haunt of demons which once was the palace of purity. Such men
   are received into society. They are looked upon as gentlemen, while the
   fallen woman, the harlot sister--she has to hide herself beneath the
   shadow of night.

   None will make excuse for her sin. But the man, the criminal--he is
   called a respectable and reputable man--he may fill places of trust and
   posts of honor. And there are none who point the finger of scorn at
   him. Sir, the voice of that poor fallen sister's blood cries to Heaven
   against you! And in the day of judgment, her damnation shall be on your
   garments. All the infamy into which you have plunged her shall lie at
   your door. And among the dreadful sights of Hell, two eyes shall glare
   at you through the murky darkness like the eyes of serpents, burning
   their way into your inmost soul.

   "You did deceive and decoy me to the pit," she says, "your arms dragged
   me down to Hell and here I lie to curse you forever and ever as the
   author of my eternal ruin." I know I address some such this morning. It
   were not possible that all men here were pure and spotless. Hear while
   yet there is time for your repentance, for the voice of her blood cries
   unto God from the ground for vengeance.

   Then there are men who educate youth in sin. Satan's captains and
   marshals--strong men with corrupt hearts--who are never better pleased
   than when they see the buds of evil swelling and ripening into crime.
   We have known some such--men of an evil eye, who not only loved sin,
   themselves, but delighted in it in others. They pat the boy on his back
   when he utters his first oath. They reward him when he commits his
   first theft. Satan has his Sunday school teachers. Hell has its
   missionaries who compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and make
   him tenfold more a child of Hell than they are themselves. Most of our
   villages are cursed with one such wretch--and is there a street in
   London which is not the haunt of one such fiend, or more?

   Oh, do I speak to any here who have applauded and praised young persons
   when they have commenced walking in the paths of infamy? Wretch! Have
   you sought to entangle them in your net? Have you, like the spider,
   thrown first one film about them, and then another, till you have them
   safely in your coils to drag them down to the den of Beelzebub? Then
   the voice of your brother's blood cries from the ground, and at the
   judgment will be a witness which you shall not be able to confute--the
   witness of the blood of souls ruined by your foul and evil training.
   Beware you who hunt for the precious life!

   Yes, and I know some base men who, if they see young converts, will
   take a pride in putting stumbling blocks in their way. They no sooner
   discover that there is some little working of conscience, than they
   laugh, they sneer, they point the finger. How often have I seen this in
   the husband who seeks to prevent the wife's attendance at the House of
   God and in the young man who jeers at his companion because he felt
   something of the power of religion! Is not this too frequent in our
   great establishments in London--where one young man kneels to pray and
   many are found to laugh at him and hurl some foul term at his head? Not
   content to perish, themselves, like dogs pursuing a rabbit, so will the
   wicked haunt the godly.

   Oh, you who are the enlisting sergeants for the Black Prince of
   Darkness, you who seem never as happy as when you set your traps for
   souls to lure them to destruction--solemnly do I warn you. Oh, take the
   warning, lest God's avenging angel, without earnest, should soon
   overtake you with the dividing sword which shall smite you even to the
   neck, and make you feel how terrible a thing it is to have tried to
   ruin the servants of the living God.

   Then there is the infidel, the man who is not content to keep his sin
   in his own breast but must publish his infamy. He ascends the platform
   and blasphemes the Almighty to His face! He defies the Eternal. He
   takes Scripture to make it the subject of unhallowed jest. He makes
   religion a theme for comedy. Take heed, Sir, there will be a tragedy
   by-and-by, in which you shall be the chief sufferer! What shall I say
   of those men who are more diligent by far than half of God's ministers
   are? Whose names we see plastered on every wall? They go from town to
   town, especially where in greatest numbers artisans are dwelling, and
   never seem content unless they are preaching against everything that is
   pure and lovely and of good report.

   They utter things which would make your cheeks blush if you heard them,
   and at the very reading of which, the marrow of your bones might
   melt--dreadful things against the Most High--such as David heard when
   he said, "Horror has taken hold of me because of the wicked that keep
   not Your Law." Oh, Sirs! Should I address such persons here, the voice
   of your brother's blood cries to Jehovah this day. The young men you
   have deluded, the working men you have led astray, the sinners whose
   lullaby you have sung, the souls that you have poisoned with your foul
   draughts, the multi-tudes--the multitudes that you have deceived--all
   these shall stand up at the last, an exceedingly great army, and
   pointing their fingers at you, shall demand your swift destruction
   because you decoyed them to their doom.

   And what shall I say of the unfaithful preacher? The slumbering
   watchman of souls, the man who swore at God's altar that he was called
   of the Holy Spirit to preach the Word of God? The man upon whose lips
   men's ears waited with attention while he stood like a priest at God's
   altar to teach Israel God's Law? The man who performed his duties
   half-a-sleep, in a dull and careless manner until men slept, too, and
   thought religion but a dream? What shall I say of the minister of
   unholy life, whose corrupt practice out of the pulpit has made the most
   telling things in the pulpit to be of no avail, has blunted the edge of
   the sword of the Spirit and turned the back of God's army in the day of
   battle?

   Yes, what shall I say of the man who has amused his audience with
   pretty things when he ought to have roused their consciences, who has
   been rounding periods when he ought to have announced the judgment of
   God? Who has been preaching a dead morality when he ought to have
   lifted Christ on high as Moses lifted the serpent in the wilderness?
   What shall I say, Brothers and Sisters, of those who have dwindled away
   their congregations, who have sown strife and schism in Churches of
   Christ once happy, peaceful and prosperous? What shall I say of the men
   who, out of the pulpit, have made a jest of the most solemn things,
   whose life has been so devoid of holy passion and devout enthusiasm
   that men have thought the Truth of God to be fiction, religion a stage
   play, prayer a nullity, the Spirit of God a phantom, and eternity a
   joke?

   Among all who will need eternal compassion, surely the unfaithful,
   unholy, unearnest minister of Christ will be the most pitiable! What
   did I say? No, rather the most contemptible, the most despicable, the
   most accursed! Surely, every thunderbolt shall make his brow its target
   and every arrow of God shall seek his conscience as its mark.

   If I must perish, let me suffer any way but as a minister who has
   desecrated the pulpit by a slumbering style of ministry, by a want of
   passion for souls. God knows how oftentimes this body trembles with
   horror at the thought the blood of souls should be required at my
   hands. And I cannot, and I hope I never may--I cannot understand that
   lifeless performance of duty, that cold and careless going through of
   services which, alas, is too common. How shall such men answer for it
   at the bar of God--the smooth things, the polite and honeyed words, the
   daubing of men with the untem-pered mortar of peace, peace, when they
   should have dealt with them honestly as in God's name?

   Oh, Sirs, if we ever play the Boanerges, we shall hear God's thunder in
   our ears and that forever and ever and, cursed of men, and cursed of
   the Most High shall we be without end. In Tophet we shall have this
   wail peculiar to ourselves, "We preached what we did not feel. We
   testified of what we did not know. Men received not our witness, for we
   were hypocrites, and deceivers, and now we go down, richly deserving
   it, to the very lowest depths of perdition."

   But, my Hearers, think not when I thus speak of the ministry, that I am
   about to permit you to escape. The voice of your brother's blood cries
   to God from the ground, even though you are no infidel lecturer, though
   you have never been debauched, though you have taught no heresy, though
   you have spread no schism. If your life is unholy, your brother's blood
   is on your garments. "Oh," says one, "if I sin, I sin to myself."
   Impossible! As well might the gasses say "I am deadly to myself alone."
   As well might the cholera say "my deadly breath is for myself only."
   Your example spreads. You, like the leper, leave uncleanliness on
   everything you touch. The very atmosphere which surrounds you breeds
   contagion.

   What others see you do, they learn to do. Some may rival you and exceed
   you, but if you taught them their letters, and they learn to read in
   Hell's book better than you, all that they learn afterwards will come
   to your door, because the elements of sin they learned from your
   practice. I am afraid many people never look at their transgressions in
   this light.

   Why, you cannot help being leaders and teachers. If in your own house
   you are a drunkard, your boys will be drunkards, too! I have heard of a
   man who flogged his boy for swearing, swearing at him all the time he
   did it. We know instances of men who feel as if they would sooner bury
   their children than see them grow up such as they are themselves--but
   yet how can it be helped?

   Your practice must, and will, influence your children. No, not your
   children only, but all with whom you come into connection in the
   mercantile world. Do not think, Sir, if you are a great employer, that
   your men can know what your life is without being affected by that
   knowledge? There may be some among them who have an inward principle
   which will not yield to temptation, but I know of hardly anything more
   dangerous than for a number of operatives to come constantly into
   contact with one whom they look up to as a master--who is also a master
   of the arts of sin and a doctor of damnation to their souls. Oh, take
   care, if not for yourselves, yet for others, or else, as sure as you
   live, the voice of your brother's blood will cry unto God from the
   ground.

   To come yet closer home to this present audience. How much of the blood
   of man will die at the door of careless professors. You that make a
   profession of being Christians, and yet live in sin, you are the
   murderers of souls by the thousands. And you, too, who are moral enough
   in your conversation, and regular in your attendance on the outward
   forms of re-ligion--you who never weep over sinners, you who never pray
   for them, you who never speak to them--you who leave all that to your
   minister, and think you have nothing to do with it--the voice of your
   brother's blood cries from the ground to Heaven.

   There died a man in your court the other day. You spoke not to him
   about his soul--his blood cries to Heaven against you! You live in a
   villa in the country. There was a neighbor of yours--you were on
   speaking terms with him but you talked not to him about his soul--he is
   dead. He is gone--his blood cries to God against you! You have
   relations, relations to whom you could speak with familiarity. You have
   talked to them of business. You have befriended them, perhaps, in their
   needs, but you have never said a word to them about escaping from Hell
   and fleeing to Heaven. When you shall hear the mournful news that they
   have departed this life--will not their blood cry against you from the
   ground where they are buried?

   You work, young man, in an establishment where you are somewhat
   respected, and, without intrusiveness you might often say a good word
   for your Master, but you do not. The blood of your fellows shall cry
   against you if they perish! Do not think the minister is the only man
   who is responsible for souls? God has made you all watchmen. All of
   you, in your spheres, are to be watchers for the souls of men. And, "If
   the watchman warns them not," says the Lord, "they shall perish but
   their blood will I require at the watchman's hands."

   I know you do not think of this, and I am sorrowfully conscious that I
   do not feel it myself so much as I ought to do. Ah, the servants of
   Satan shame me! They shame me, they shame me! There comes at night a
   message to some of you who are the servants of Satan--"The master is
   come, and he calls for you." You leave your wife and your children
   without a tear. You go to your master's house and there are cups, foul
   cups, passing round, and you will drink, and drink, and drink, and
   drink on--never denying your master, confessing him with many an
   oath--saying to your comrades many things which injure your poor souls,
   and yet you do it so bravely, oh, so bravely!

   You hardly know how you get home at night, but when the morning comes
   and you awake, there is the redness of the eyes, the headache, and the
   sickness. But the next night when your master wants you, you go again.
   And so you will do year after year, even though delirium tears you like
   a whirlwind. But here am I, a servant of God, and when my Master calls
   for me, and bids me go and confess Him, I am tempted to be still. And
   when He tells me to speak to yonder man, I would wickedly avoid the
   task. And whereas you confess your master and imprecate a curse upon
   your heads, how often do some of us confess our Master as timidly as if
   we feared a curse, when instead it is by confession that the curse is
   turned away!

   Oh, it is enough to make us Christians ashamed to think how sinners
   will confess their god! Hear them at night as they reel home through
   the streets! They are not ashamed of their lord and master. Hear how
   they swear and defy Heaven! They are ashamed of nothing for their lord.
   And yet we, who have Heaven for our reward, and such a Christ to serve,
   and One so good and gracious to us--look at us--look at us! What poor
   lovers of our Savior are we! What poor lovers of the souls of men! I
   know this is not true of all of you, for there are some of you who love
   men's souls. I have delighted to see in many of you that deep
   earnestness which makes you yearn for the conversion of others. You
   will sometimes take your stand at the corner of the street, and though
   you cannot speak as you would, yet, the tears running down your cheeks
   prove your earnestness.

   There are many women among you, too, who have spoken a good word for
   Christ in strange places, and have never been ashamed of Him. But oh,
   there are some of you, the members of this Church, over whom the angels
   of glory might weep, for what do you do for Christ? What do you give to
   Christ? You are content to go to Heaven, yourselves, but you let your
   neighbors perish for lack of knowledge, and neither the Mission will
   you help, nor anything else besides. The blood, the blood of dying
   London cries from the ground against you before God!

   The perishing crowds of every street, and every court and every alley
   send up their wail to Heaven--"O, God! Your professing people have
   forgotten us." The daughter of Zion is become like the ostrich of the
   desert. The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to the roof of its
   mouth for want of moisture! O, God, will You not visit Your Church for
   this, and make these, Your people, that forget the souls of men, smart
   even to the quick?

   I do not know whether I have seized hold of any of your consciences,
   but if I have, may God the Holy Spirit get such a grip of you that He
   may never let you rest till you say, "Great God, in Your name I will do
   something, that the next time I hear the bell toll I may be able to
   say, 'I did what I could for that man and if his soul has perished, his
   blood does not lie at my door, for I did tell him the way of salvation,
   I did exhort him to flee from the wrath to come.' " I am afraid none of
   us are altogether guiltless here. We must all take some degree of sin
   to our own consciences. I fear against everyone of us, to some extent,
   the voice of our brother's blood cries unto Heaven because of our
   sloth.

   II. But to pass on. I was, in the second place, to HOLD UP THIS CRIME
   TO SCORN--the chief point being whose blood it is. It is the blood of
   our Brethren. "The voice ofyour brother's blood cries out to Me from
   the ground." All men are our Brethren. If any of them perish, and if we
   have not done our best for their conversion, their blood has a fearful
   and telling cry against us when it reaches to Heaven. But I shall
   rather dwell this morning upon certain special cases. Perhaps, young
   man, it is your natural brother's blood that cries against you. You
   have been converted to God, say, these three, four, ten, or twenty
   years. You have done nothing for your brother's conversion--never
   written him a letter begging him to think of his state. Never spoken a
   kind and gentle word to him about Christ.

   No, you have been content to let him know you were a Christian, and
   were half afraid of that, but you have done nothing for him. Will not
   your brother, if he perishes, be well able to say, "My brother and I
   did hang at the same breast, and were rocked in the same cradle. We
   played together. We filled one home with glee--he professed to know the
   way of life but he never told me the way. He professed to have pardon
   for his sins, but he never told me how I might find it, too. He
   suffered me to go unpitied to my doom without a tear"? Will not the
   voice of such blood as that cry against us if we have been guilty?

   It may be, however, it is the blood of your father or mother. Some of
   you young people have come to London and God has met with you in this
   House of Prayer. You still have ungodly parents in the country--have
   you quite forgotten them? What if your gray-headed sire should die! You
   know he never thinks of God. What if he should die before his son has
   talked to him! Oh, you have a strange power, you sons and daughters. If
   you will only pluck the old man by the sleeve and say, "Father, by the
   child's love I bear you, I would desire to see you saved!"

   And do you fling this power away? Would you see your father and mother
   sold to slavery, and if it were in your power to redeem them, would you
   keep the sordid pelf? Or if you saw them sick, would you spare your
   feet and not run for a physician? Or if you saw them sinking in the
   stream, would you not leap in, at the peril of your own life, and
   rescue them? And will you let them perish, perish forever, without a
   struggle on your part? Will you see them go down to the depths without
   stretching out a helping hand? I cannot think thus of you, if God has
   truly touched your hearts!

   But what shall I say to those who are not only careless of parents but
   are neglecting their own children? Mother, what if the voice of your
   child's blood should cry to God against you? You trained that child up
   without the fear of God. You sent your boy and girl to school on the
   Sunday, it is true, but that was only to get rid of them. What was your
   own example to them? Bad. What was the father's example? Vicious. When
   your boy grows up he becomes reckless. You cannot get him to come to a
   place of worship with you now. No, but if you had brought him when he
   was a child, it may be he would have been here now. And, inasmuch as
   you have tutored him for Satan, if that boy of yours goes down to the
   pit, his soul shall cry against you.

   Up to Heaven shall it send its shriek--"Oh God! The mother that did
   bear me, and the man that did beget me were as cruel to me as if I were
   not their child, for they suffered me to come here without weeping for
   me, without praying for me, without taking me in their arms of loving
   supplication and pleading that I might be saved!"

   Look at this again in the case of some of you against whom the
   indictment lies, that you have done injury to your servants. Oh, I know
   great cotton growers, builders and traders, that have many men in their
   employment and have much to answer for. Sirs, though it is your skill
   and your capital that brings in your wealth, have you no responsibility
   towards the men who day and night toil for you? You pay them their
   wages, but do you think your responsibility has ceased with that? Are
   they not the very bones and sinews of your establishment, and after
   taking everything into consideration, do you not owe far more to them
   than ever the best remuneration can pay?

   And what if you have left their spiritual state uncared for? Have you
   said, "Oh, it is no business of mine what they do with their Sundays. I
   do not care what they do when they are out of the mill, or away from
   the workshop"? What? Sirs, do you think that as those hundreds of souls
   go before God they will lay no impeachment against you? Do you think
   they will not arraign you at God's bar? I tell you, and I think I speak
   in the Spirit of God when I say this, you shall find that the voices of
   your neglected workers, the voices of those whom you never sought to
   bless with spiritual instruction, shall cry against you from the
   ground!

   Would that I had an audience, for the moment, consisting more largely
   of such persons! There are some here who can, I think, plead exemption,
   for they have done much to spread spiritual light among those who toil
   for them. But I do fear they are rather the exception than the rule,
   and that there are many who think no more of the men that work for them
   than of their horses--and some not as much. They take as much interest
   in the spirit of the beast that goes downwards as in the soul of man
   that goes upwards. Let it be so no more! Employers, contractors, you
   that have great influence, I do entreat you--shall I fall upon my knees
   to do it? I could not then do it more earnestly--see to it that your
   brothers' blood lie not on your garments throughout eternity!

   Oh, there is one sinner who can look upon this in a solemn light! Who
   is it that has gone down to the pit? You, Man, yonder--who is it that
   died but a few days ago? The woman that loved you as she loved her own
   soul! The woman who idolized you--who thought you an angel. Shall I say
   it before God and to your face?--you ruined her! And what next, Sir?
   You cast her off as though she were but dirt, and threw her into the
   kennel with a broken heart. And being there, her god having cast her
   off--for you were her god--she fell into despair. And despair led to
   dreadful consequences and to direr ruin, still. She has gone, and you
   are glad of it--glad of it--for you will hear no more of her now, you
   say.

   Sir, you shall hear of it. You shall hear of it. You shall hear of it!
   As long as you live her spirit shall haunt you, track you to the filthy
   joy which you have planned for a future day. And on your death bed she
   shall be there to twist her fingers in your hair, to tear your soul out
   of your body, and drag it down to the Hell appointed for such fiends as
   you--for you spilt her blood, the blood of her that trusted you--a
   fair, frail thing, worthy to be an angel's sister. And you pulled her
   down and made her a devil's tool! God save you! For if He does not,
   your damnation shall be seven-fold. Oh, you son of Belial, what shall
   be your doom when God deals with you as you deserve?

   Are these hot words? Not half so hot as I would make them. I would send
   them hissing into your souls if I were able. Not so much to condemn
   you, as with the hope that though you cannot make good the mischief you
   have done, you may yet turn from the error of your ways to seek a
   Savior's blood and find pardon for this great iniquity! Oh, dear
   Friends, let us all take something of our text home. When we think of
   friends who are dead and gone, are there none over whose corpses we
   must say, "I did not do what I could for this man. I did not do what I
   could for this woman"?

   I know when I go down to the village where I used to preach, and as I
   look upon the houses, I am apt to question my-self--Was I as earnest
   with the people as I used to be? I can say I hope I never flinched from
   telling them all the Truth of God, though sometimes it had to be very
   rudely and roughly spoken. But yet God knows I do sometimes smite
   myself to think I did not weep over them more and did not entreat them
   more to be won to Christ.

   And you, too, that sit in these pews so often--many of you are joyful
   converts to Christ--but numbers of you are still unsaved. What if any
   of you should be able to say at the last, "We trusted our minister. We
   hung upon his lips. We were never absent. We loved the Sunday, but oh,
   he did not tell us of our sin. He did not plead with us to be saved. He
   left us to ourselves--he was cold when his heart should have been hot.
   He was a man without tears and had a heart without sympathy for us!"

   Oh, Sirs, God grant you may never be able to say that of me! God save
   you, for my soul longs for you. He is my witness how earnestly I long
   for you all to be in the heart of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ!
   Come unto Him! Come unto Him! I let not your blood cry out against me!
   Oh, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and trust Him! Trust Him now, that
   you may be saved, and that at last I may be able to say, "Here am I and
   the children whom You have given me. You have kept them through Your
   power and they are preserved even to the end. Unto You be glory forever
   and ever!"

   III. We are in the third place, and that only for a moment, TO EXPECT
   THE JUDGMENT. "The voice of your brother's blood cries out to Me from
   the ground." It does not cry to a deaf ear but to the ear of One who
   hears and feels the cry, and will certainly make bare His arm to smite
   the offender and to avenge the wrong. Seducer, Infidel, Tempter of the
   young, God hears the cry that goes up against you, and this is its
   burden--it comes from souls damned through your influence, and they
   say--"Lord give him his portion with the tormentors. Let him suffer,
   for we suffer. He slew us, avenge our death!" He will do it and the day
   shall come when swift destruction shall overtake you, and as with a rod
   of iron will He break you. As a potter's vessel so will He dash you in
   pieces, and who shall deliver you out of His hands?

   The cry goes up to Heaven against barren, careless, cold-hearted
   professors, from many in London, untaught and untrained, who are on
   their beds today in the jaws of death. They cry out, I say, against
   you, careless Christians, and they say "Lord, take away their
   privileges from them! Lord, take them away from the Church which they
   disfigure and dishonor! Lord, take away these trees that bear no leaves
   for the healing of the nations! Sweep away this salt which has lost its
   savor! Lord, cast these candles that give no light into the fire! O
   Lord, take away, take away, once and for all, these cities that are not
   set on hills but are hidden from the sight of men."

   What would you say if God should visit this Church, for instance, and
   take out of it all of you who are useless? How would the catalog be
   thinned! How would our lists show here and there the black mark of
   erasure! Unless you are doing something to win souls, the voice of your
   brother's blood cries to God from the ground--and it cries that your
   privileges may be taken away, and the candlestick moved out of its
   place. And it will be so, my Hearers, it will be so unless all of us
   arise to serve our Master. We are happy when God prospers us, but if we
   get many in our midst who do nothing for Christ, we shall have
   "Ichabod" written on these walls.

   The walls that now ring with the song of the multitude shall hear only
   the wail of a desolate few. The pulpit that now thunders out God's own
   voice will become a dead, dreary, and voiceless platform. The time will
   come when your deacons and your elders shall be no more men of earnest
   hearts--and when you shall grope as the blind in the midnight and
   say--"Oh, that God would give us back once more such times as we used
   to have, which we frittered away through our carelessness, and lost
   through our lukewarmness."

   Further, how awful must be the cry of this blood from the ground
   against a minister! I think I hear it, a cry from earth, from Heaven,
   from Hell--"Hurl him from his pulpit. Tear away his vestments! Snatch
   the book from his blood-stained hand! Smite upon the mouth the dog that
   will not bark. Let his corpse fall before men's eyes. Let him be made a
   hissing and a byword, because, being made a winner of souls, he dared
   to trifle, and being made a watchman of a besieged city, he dared to
   lie down and slumber. Tear him down! Tear him down! Tear him down," a
   hundred voices cry! Though he is a bishop or a great man in the Church.
   Though his eloquence is unrivalled. Though his power is matchless,
   pluck him down from his high places--miscreant that he is, to waste
   men's time--and ruin men's souls forever!"

   And what shall the cry be against you who still continue by your
   ill-example to lead others into sin--open Sinners and Infidels? It
   would be an awful thing to pray for a man's damnation. But there are
   some people I know of who while they live do so much mischief, that if
   they were dead, men would breathe more freely. I know a village where
   there lives a man who contaminates half the population. There is a
   sneer upon his face at which virtue blushes. There is a sneer at which
   even courage quails. He is a wretch so well taught, and so deeply
   instructed in the highest science of iniquity, that wherever he may go,
   he finds none a match for him--either in his reasoning or in the
   infamous conclusions which he draws. He is a deadly upas tree, dropping
   black poison upon all beneath his shadow.

   I did think once I would half pray that the man might die and go to his
   doom, but one must not. And yet, were he gone, the saints might say,
   "It is well," and as over Babylon, when she is destroyed, and the smoke
   of her torment goes up forever, the saints will say "Hallelujah." So
   have I thought that over these against whom the blood of many young
   people cries to God from the ground, when they go, at last, to their
   doom, men might almost say, Hallelujah, for God has judged the great
   sinner who did make the people of the earth drunk with the wine of his
   fornication.

   IV. I hope that these terrible things have prepared our minds to hear
   better THE VOICE OF EXHORTATION.

   If there is the voice of blood crying against us today, and we affirm
   that none of us can altogether escape from it, what shall we do to be
   rid of the past? Can tears of repentance do it? No. Can promises of
   amendment make a blank page where there are so many blots and blurs?
   Ah, no! Nothing that we can do can put away our sin. But may not the
   future atone? May not future zeal wipe out past carelessness? May not
   the endeavor of our life that is yet to come make amends for the
   indolence or vice of the life that is past? No. The blood of our
   Brethren has been shed, and we cannot gather it up. The mischief we
   have done is not to be retrieved!

   O God! Souls that are lost through us cannot be saved now. The gates of
   Hell are so shut that they can never be opened. We can make no
   restitution. The redemption of the soul is precious, and it ceases
   forever. The sin is not to be washed away by repentance, nor retrieved
   by reformation. What then? Hopeless despair for you, and I, and
   everyone of us, were it not that there is another blood--the blood of
   One called Jesus--that cries from the ground, too, and the voice of
   that blood is, "Father, forgive them! Father, forgive them!" I hear a
   voice that says, "Vengeance, vengeance, vengeance," like the voice of
   Jonah in Nineveh, enough to make every man clothe himself in sackcloth.

   But a sweeter, and a louder cry comes up--"Mercy, mercy, mercy." And
   the Father bows His head and says, "Whose blood is that?" And the voice
   replies, "It is the blood of Your only Begotten, shed on Calvary for
   sin. The Father lays His thunders by, sheathes His sword, stretches out
   His hands and cries to you, the sons of men, "Come unto Me and I will
   have mercy upon you. Turn, turn. I will pour out My Spirit upon you,
   and you shall live." "Repent and believe the Gospel." Hate the sin that
   is past, and trust in Jesus for the future. He is able to save to the
   uttermost all that come unto God by Him. For the blood of Jesus Christ,
   God's dear Son, cleans us from all sin.

   Flee, Sinner, flee! The avenger of the blood that you have shed pursues
   you with hot haste, with feet that are winged--with a heart that is
   athirst for blood, he pursues you. Run, Man, run! The City of Refuge is
   before you. It is there, along the narrow way of faith. Fly, Man, fly,
   for unless you reach that city before he overtake you, he shall smite
   you and one blow shall be your everlasting ruin. For God's sake, do not
   loiter, Man! Those flowers on the left-hand side, care not for them.
   You will dye that field with your blood if you linger there!

   That ale house on the right hand? Stay for none of these things. He
   comes! Listen! His footsteps on the hard highway! He comes, he comes,
   he comes now! Oh, that now you may pass the portals of the City of
   Refuge! Trust the Son of God, and sin is forgiven, and you have entered
   into everlasting life.

   Good Lord, add Your blessing! We are powerless. We can say no more. For
   Christ's sake, "by His agony and bloody sweat, by His Cross and
   passion, by His precious death and burial," bless these souls. Amen.

                        Creation--An Argument For Faith

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 27, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Ah Lord God, behold, You have made the Heaven and the earth by Your
   great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for
   You." Jeremiah 32:17.

   AT the very time when the Chaldeans had cast up mounds round about the
   city of Jerusalem, and when the sword and famine and pestilence had
   desolated the whole land, Jeremiah, while in prison, was commanded by
   his God to purchase a field of Hanamel, his uncle's son at Anathoth. He
   was to subscribe the evidence of purchase by the usual witnesses, to
   seal the deed of transfer according to law and custom, and to do this
   publicly in the presence of all the Jews that sat in the court of the
   prison.

   Now, this was a strange purchase for a rational man to make. Prudence
   could not justify it--it was purchasing an estate which was utterly
   valueless. Reason would repudiate the notion. It was buying with
   scarcely a probability that the person purchasing could ever enjoy the
   possession. But it was enough for Jeremiah that his God had bid him,
   for well he knew that God will be justified of all His children who act
   in faith. He bought the piece of land, and it was secured to him. He
   did as he was commanded and returned to his dungeon.

   When he came into his chamber alone, it is possible that he began to
   question himself as to what he had been doing and troubled thoughts
   rolled over his mind. "I have been purchasing a useless possession,"
   said he. See how he refuses to indulge the thought. He gets as far as
   saying, "Ah, Lord God!" as if he were about to utter some unbelieving
   or rebellious sentence--but he stops himself, "You can make this plot
   of ground of use to me. You can rid this land of these oppressors. You
   can make me yet sit under my vine and my fig tree in the heritage which
   I have bought. For You did make the heavens and the earth and there is
   nothing too hard for You."

   Beloved, this gave a majesty to the early saints, that they dared to do
   at God's command, things which were unaccountable to sense and which
   reason would condemn. They consulted not with flesh and blood. But
   whether it is a Noah who is to build a ship on dry land, an Abraham who
   is to offer up his only son, or a Moses who is to despise the treasures
   of Egypt, or a Joshua who is to besiege Jericho seven days using no
   weapons but the blasts of rams' horns--they all act upon God's command.
   They act contrary to all the dictates of carnal reason. And God, even
   the Lord God, gives a rich reward as the result of their obedient
   faith.

   I would to God we had in the religion of these modern times, a more
   potent infusion of this heroic faith in God. But no. I see the
   Christian Church degenerating more and more into a society acting upon
   the same principles as commercial companies. The Church, I fear, cannot
   now say, "We walk by faith and not by sight." When Edward Irving
   preached that memorable sermon concerning the missionary, who, he
   thought, was bound to go forth without purse or scrip, and trust in his
   God alone, to preach the Word, a howl went up to Heaven against the man
   as a fanatic.

   They said he was visionary, unpractical, mad--and all because he dared
   to preach a sermon full of faith in God. I do avow myself fully in
   sympathy with the views which he then enunciated. And I think, if the
   power of God were once more to baptize the Church, we should have men
   who would dare to trust in God instead of putting confidence in men.
   Men who would act once more as if God's bare arm were quite enough to
   lean on, as if faith were not fanaticism, as if confidence in an unseen
   Being were not an unjustifiable enthusiasm.

   I would to God the Church had once again a rich anointing of the
   supernatural, and I believe she would have, if she would again act by
   faith. And if you and I, Brothers and Sisters, would venture more upon
   the naked promises of God, we should enter a world of wonders to which
   as yet we are strangers. If we would but walk the waters of trouble by
   a living faith, we should find them solid as marble beneath our feet.
   If once again we could, like the world, be hung upon nothing but the
   simple power and Providence of God, I am sure we should find it a
   blessed and a safe way of living-- glorious to God and honorable to
   ourselves.

   I would that once again the Master would raise up a race of heroes who
   would be ridiculed by the world, and despised by mere professors. Men
   who would act by faith in the God that lives and abides forever. Men
   who venture on bold deeds where the weakness of the human arm would be
   manifest, and the might of Deity revealed. Then should we see the
   millennial age dawning upon us, and God, even our own God, would bless
   us, and all the ends of the earth would fear

   Him.

   Dear Fiends, it is my business this morning to conduct you to
   Jeremiah's place of confidence. Seeing that his case is hopeless,
   knowing that man can do nothing at all for him, the Prophet resorts at
   once to the God that created the Heaven and the earth and he exclaims,
   "Nothing is too hard for You." I shall use my text in addressing three
   characters--to stimulate the evangelist. To encourage the enquirer. And
   to comfort the Believer.

   I. TO STIMULATE THE EVANGELIST. And who is the evangelist? Every man
   and woman who has tasted that the Lord is gracious should be an
   Evangelist. We should, without exception, if we have been begotten
   again into a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
   dead, tell to all around us what they must do to be saved. There should
   be no dumb tongue in all our host. We should have no idle hand in the
   harvest field, but everyone in his measure, whether man or woman,
   should be doing something to extend the knowledge of our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ.

   And here, dear Brother in Christ, my friend and Fellow laborer, here is
   your encouragement--the work is God's-- and your success is in the hand
   of Him who made the Heaven and the earth. Let me refresh your memory
   with the old story of creation and I think you will perceive flashes of
   light upon your work which will greatly encourage you in it.

   1. Remember, in the first place, that the world was created from
   nothing. You have often said, "Mine is a very hard task, for I address
   myself to men in whom I see nothing hopeful. I batter against a granite
   conscience, but it is not moved.

   1 thunder forth the Law but the dead and callous heart has not been
   stirred. I talk of the love of Christ but the eye is not suffused with
   tears. I point to Hell but no terror follows. And to Heaven but no holy
   desire is kindled! There is nothing in man that encourages me in my
   work, and I am ready to give up."

   Brother, come back with me to the world's creation. Of what did God
   make the world? Was there any substance available to His hand out of
   which to mold this round globe? What do the Scriptures say? Did He not
   make it of nothing? You have never yet grasped the idea of nothing. The
   eye cannot see it. It might peer into space, but space itself is
   something. We look up, and yonder is the blue ether, though we know not
   what it is. But the eye could not look on nothing. It would be blinded.
   Nothing is a thing which the senses cannot grasp, and yet it is out of
   this awful nothing that God made the sun and moon and stars and all
   things that are.

   Had He spoken before creation, there would have been no voice to answer
   Him. Had He cried, there would have been no echo to repeat His voice.
   Nothing was there anywhere, and yet He spoke and it was done. He
   commanded and it stood fast! The case of the sinner is a parallel one.
   You say there is nothing in the sinner? Yes, there is room here for a
   recreating work. Inasmuch as that heart is now empty and void, there is
   space for the Eternal God to come, and with His outstretched arm, to
   create a new heart and a right spirit, and put His Grace where there
   was none before.

   If you had to convert the sinner, then, indeed, your task were as
   hopeless as to create new orbs out of nothing. But, inasmuch as it is
   not you, but your God who works all things, you may console yourselves
   with this thought--He who has created all this marvelous earth and had
   nothing to begin with, can give life, and fear, and hope, and faith,
   and love, where there were no heavenly ingredients upon which He might
   work. Take that, then, for your joy.

   2. But you tell me you have none to help you or go forth in your work,
   you have no patronage. "Ah, Sir," says one, "if I had a society at my
   back. If I had at least a few warm-hearted friends that were banded
   with me, that would give me some encouragement. But I have to go forth
   alone--of the people there are none with me. I stand up to preach in a
   village where all are cold and callous--where even my minister tells me
   I am a rash, bold young man, and had better hold my tongue. I look to
   the world and it hates me. I turn to the Church and it despises me. I
   am too enthusiastic for the Church. I am too fanatical for the world.
   What can I do? I am a man alone, and I have no helper!"

   Brother, when God made the world--and the same God is with you--He
   worked alone. With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him?
   When He balanced the clouds and laid the foundations for the earth, who
   taught Him the laws of gravity? Who has weighed the mountains in scales
   and the hills in a balance? Was He not alone? No parlia- ment of angels
   bowed at His right hand, for He created even them. No archangel bowed
   his head and offered advice to the Most High, for the archangel,
   himself, is but a creature. Cherubim and seraphim might sing when the
   work was over, but they could not help in the work.

   Look, now--what star did the angels make? What spot of earth is the
   creation of an archangel? Look to the heavens above or to the deeps
   beneath--where do you see you the work of any hand but God's--and that
   hand a solitary one? The lonely worker out of emptiness creates
   fullness, out of non-existence calls all things, and out of Himself
   gets both the matter and the manner, the way and the how. His courts
   need no revenue from abroad to sustain them, for from Himself, alone,
   He draws the force which is needed.

   Roll, then, your burden on your God if you are alone, for alone with
   Him you have the best of company. If you had the hosts of Heaven with
   you, what were you without your God? If all the Church were at your
   back, terrible as an army with banners, your defeat were certain if the
   Holy Spirit did not dwell in you. I tell you, Man, if all the saints
   and angels in earth and Heaven should unite to help you in your
   pursuit, yet, if your God should stand aloof from you, you would labor
   in vain and spend your strength for nothing. But with Him you shall
   prevail though all men forsake you--

   "When He makes bare His arm, What shall His work withstand? When He His
   people's cause defends, Who, who shall stay His hand?"

   Let not this, then, trouble you, that you are alone. "Ah Lord God,
   behold, You have made the Heaven and the earth by Your great power and
   stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for You."

   3. But you will reply to me, "My sorrow lies not so much in that I am
   alone, as in the melancholy fact that I am very conscious of my own
   weakness and of my want of adaptation for my peculiar work. I come back
   from my Sunday's toil, saying, 'Who has believed my report and to whom
   is the arm of the Lord revealed?' It seems to me as though I plowed a
   rock, a rock so hard that it blunted the plowshare. I can make no
   impression upon it. I have beaten the air.

   "I seem to have lashed the waters. I fear that I have not the gifts
   which are necessary, nor have I the Divine Grace that I should have.
   Woe is me, for I am a man of uncircumcised lips! I am not sufficient
   for these things. But rather I feel like Jonah, that I would flee into
   Tarshish, that I might escape from the burden of the Lord against this
   Nineveh." Yes. But Brother, come, cast your thought back again upon
   creation. The Eternal needed no instruments in creation. What tools did
   God use when He made the heavens and the earth? When the blacksmith
   brings forth his work, he fashions it with hammer and anvil--upon what
   anvil did God beat the red-hot matter of this earth when He formed it
   and made it what it is?

   I know that the engraver needs a sharp tool, upon which he bears with
   all his might when he traces out the lines of beauty. But when God drew
   this fair picture--this wondrous landscape of the heavens and the
   earth--what engraving tools did He have? Where do you learn that He had
   any instruments in His mighty hands? The carpenter has his plane, and
   his hammer, and his awl--what plane, what hammer, and what awl did the
   Eternal use? Had He anything beside His own hands?

   Are not the heavens the works of His fingers, and the sun and the moon
   His handiwork? So then, if God can work without instruments in the
   creation of a world, He can surely work with a poor, and a mean
   instrument, in the conversion of a sinner! When I think of myself, it
   seems to me as if the Almighty Worker did take a straw into His hand
   with which to penetrate a granite rock. Yet, I know, though it is a
   straw, if it is in His hands, it would be able to pierce the globe and
   thread the spheres as on a string.

   I know that if the Lord takes in His hands but a smooth stone out of
   the current, yet when He hurls it from His sling, it shall pierce even
   a giant's brow. He saves not by man's strength, nor by human learning
   and eloquence and talent. It is His strength and not the strength or
   weakness of the instruments to which we must look. I pray you, turn
   your eye away from yourself. What are you? A son of man, in whom is no
   strength! A man that is born of woman--unclean in your origin and
   unhallowed in your actions. Is there anything in you to give our God
   one reason to make you a winner of souls?

   But, inasmuch as you are nothing, you are all the better fitted to be
   used by Him. He shall have all the more glory because of your weakness.
   I pray you, therefore, say, with Paul, "I glory in infirmities, that
   the power of God may rest on me." And let this be your song--"We have
   this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may
   be of

   God and not of us." "Ah Lord God, behold, You have made the Heaven and
   the earth by Your great power and stretched out arm, and there is
   nothing too hard for You." You can do wonders even by the mean
   instrument of sinful man.

   4. Do I hear you still complain and say--"Alas, alas! It is little I
   can say! When I speak, I can but give out the text and utter a few
   plain words upon it--true and earnest, but not mighty. I cannot sound
   out the rolling periods of a Robert Hall, nor wing my flight to the
   majestic heights of a Chalmers. I have no power to plead with souls
   with the tears and the seraphic zeal of a Whitfield. I can only tell
   the tale of mercy simply and leave it there"?

   Well, and did not God create all things by His naked Word? Was there
   any eloquence when God spoke and it was done? "Let there be light," and
   there was light. Can you perceive any trappings of oratory here? At
   this day, is not the Gospel in itself the rod of Jehovah's strength? Is
   it not the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes? And
   does not our Beloved Apostle constantly insist upon it, that it is not
   with wisdom of words, nor with fineness of speech, lest the excellency
   of the power should not be of God but of man? And lest man's faith
   should stand in the wisdom of man and not in the power of the Most
   High?

   Go on, my Brother Evangelist, go on and speak God's Word still, for it
   is the Word which is mighty through God to the pulling down of
   strongholds. 'Twas His naked Word, unadorned, simple and plain, which
   at the beginning made the Heaven and the earth. What can be more
   sublimely simple than, "Let there be light"? Go and say in the same
   simplicity, "Sinner, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ," and your
   message shall be the voice of God from Heaven which shall not return
   unto Him void but shall prosper in the thing whereunto He has sent it.

   5. "Alas," I hear a Brother crying from some corner of the building,
   "You are not aware of the darkness of the district in which I labor. I
   toil among a benighted, unintelligent, ignorant people. I cannot expect
   to see fruit there, toil as I may." Ah, Brother, and while you talk so,
   you never will see any fruit, for God gives not great things to
   unbelieving men. For the encouragement of your faith, let me remind you
   that it is the God that made the heavens and the earth on whom you have
   to lean--and what is that which was written of old: "The earth was
   without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep."

   How dense that darkness was, I cannot tell. That primeval darkness
   which had never been stirred by a single ray of light. That dense,
   thick seven-fold Egyptian darkness that had never known a sun or moon
   and had never been pierced by light of star. And yet, primeval though
   it was--I was about to call it eternal darkness but nothing can be
   eternal but the Most High--yet there was but a Word--"Light be," and
   light was. And do you think the darkness of your hearers is thicker
   than this ancient darkness of the everlasting night? Even were it so,
   still, God is Almighty. He has but to speak through you, has but to
   make your word His Word and the films of blindness shall fall from the
   eyes, and he that was wrapped in midnight shall be brought out into
   marvelous day!

   I would like to know where the dark place on the earth is, for there it
   is that the missionaries should first be sent. O that we had faith to
   do and dare for God, and undertake the hardest tasks first! But alas!
   We are such cowards, we love fair fields of labor. We want promising
   prospects. We will plant a Chapel where there is a likelihood that the
   people will appreciate it. We send a missionary where we think there is
   a probability that they will receive His Word. But shall we send the
   man where, in our judgment, they will not receive Christ, and bid him
   go where they will cast out His name as evil? This is to act by faith,
   and this is what the heroism of the Gospel demands.

   Gird up your loins, followers of Christ, seek for difficulties and
   overcome them. If you are not greater than other men, how are you the
   followers of the Divine Jesus? If you cannot go where others despair,
   how dwells the Holy Spirit in you? If you will not risk where others
   flee, where is the glorious majesty of your faith?

   6. Further--and still to press the same blessed argument. "Yes," says
   one, "but the men among whom I labor are so confused in their notions.
   They put darkness for light and light for darkness. Their moral sense
   is blunted. If I try to teach them, their ears are dull of hearing and
   their hearts are given to slumber. Besides, they are full of vain
   jangling and oppose themselves to the Truth of God. I endure much
   contradiction of sinners, and they will not receive the Truth of God in
   the love of it."

   Yes, then, I bid you go back to the old creation that you may be
   comforted concerning the new. Did not the Holy Spirit brood with
   shadowing wings over the earth when it was chaos? Did He not bring out
   order from confusion? Do you not remember how, on a certain day, the
   Lord divided the waters that were above the firmament from those that
   were under the firmament? Do you not know how He rolled together the
   waters into their place and called the dry land, earth, and the
   gathering together of the waters called He seas? What greater confusion
   could there be? That incandescent mass which had once, perhaps, been
   gas, and afterwards condensed itself into a globe of liquid fire, was
   cooled with the blessed breath of God.

   And when its crust grew hard and the tumultuous waters threw their
   waves over the heads of Alpine heights. When the winds came roaring
   forth and with carnival of hurricanes mingled sky and earth together.
   When cloud, and hill, and sea, and air, were all one seething mass, the
   blue sky appeared and clouds rolled upwards to their place and seas
   came downwards to their beds. He spoke, and lo, the obedient waters
   which had flung their white crests like the manes of wild horses
   tossing in the wind, hastened to their appointed stable in the deep.
   And there they remain, kept in check by no more mighty a bridle than a
   belt of sand. Then the earth stood out all fair and glittering, for God
   had done it. Disorder yielded to law. Darkness gave place to light.
   Chaos turned to glorious order in His sight.

   Well, now, the same marvels can be worked in your case, only take care
   that you act for God and in God's strength, or else you might as well
   bid a stormy sea be still, as you command the confused notions of men
   to find rest and peace in Christ. He that made the heavens and the
   earth, even the everlasting God, can move your difficulty away--only
   trust in Him and He shall bring it to pass.

   7. "Ah," you say, "they are all so dead, so dead!" Yes, Sir, and do you
   not remember how the waters brought forth life abundantly--fish and
   fowl that should fly in the midst of Heaven? And how the earth--yes,
   this dull, dusky earth-- brought forth the creeping things and the
   cattle after its kind? And how at last, man was made out of the very
   dust of the earth? O Sir, God can readily give life to the dead nature
   of evil men! You have but to rely on Him, and the quickening influence
   shall descend and you shall live.

   8. See how fair and glorious this earth is now! Well might the morning
   stars shout together and the sons of God shout for joy! And do you
   think that God cannot make as fair a heart in man, and make it bud and
   blossom and teem with hallowed life? Do you think that Christ cannot
   make the angels sing even a nobler song of joy over a soul that is
   washed in blood, and a spirit robed in white, that shall praise God and
   the Lamb forever? And all this He can do through you and me, my
   Brother!

   O, let us labor, then! Let us work and toil. Let us think difficulties,
   delights, and troubles, but trifles. Let us lean upon Him that made the
   heavens and the earth, for there is nothing too hard for Him. Unbelief
   will make you unhappy. It will cause your service to be a stench in the
   nostrils of the Most High. Unbelief will prevent God from blessing you.
   "He could not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief."
   "If you will believe all things are possible to him that believes." And
   if you will act as one who sees Him that is invisible, you shall see
   greater things than these, and God shall make your path to be as the
   shining light that shines more and more unto the perfect day.

   II. In this large assembly, there are no doubt, many to be found who
   are really desirous to be saved, but are full of doubts and
   difficulties and questionings. I speak, then, TO THE ANXIOUS.

   May I cut a knot in a moment by making one observation. Remember, my
   troubled Friend, that the question about your salvation is not whether
   you can save yourself, for that is answered in a thundering negative
   from God's throne-- You cannot! "By the works of the Law shall no flesh
   living be justified." The question is--Can God save you? And if you
   will put it on that ground, I think your answer need not be a very
   difficult one.

   Can God save you? That is the question. Now I know your unbelief will
   suggest first the difficulty that your mind is so dark. "I cannot see
   Christ," says one. "I am in such trouble of mind, I cannot understand
   as I would. I feel benighted. I am like the inhabitants of Zebulon and
   Napthali, a people that sat in darkness and in the valley of the shadow
   of death. I cannot see--it is all darkness, thick as night with me."
   Yes, but then there is the question--Can God roll this night away? And
   the answer comes, He who said, "Let there be light," and there was
   light, can certainly repeat the miracle. Another of your doubts will
   arise from the fact that you feel so weak--

   "I would, but cannot sing.
   I would, but cannot pray.
   For Satan meets me when I try,
   And frights my soul away.
   I would, but can't repent,
   Though I endeavor often.
   This stony heart can never relent
   Till Jesus makes it soft.
   I would, but cannot love,
   Though wooed by love Divine.
   No arguments have power to move
   A soul so base as mine.
   I would, but cannot rest
   In God's most holy will.
   I know what He appoints is best,
   Yet murmur at it still.
   could I but believe! Then all would easy be.
   1 would, but cannot--Lord, relieve-- My help must come from You!"

   I cannot do what I would. I would leave sin, but still I fall into it.
   I would lay hold on Christ, but I cannot. Then comes the question--Can
   God do it? And we answer, He who made the heavens and the earth without
   a helper, can certainly save you when you can not help yourself.

   Let me remind you that no part of the world helped its own creation. It
   is absolutely certain that no mountain uplifted its own head. It is
   quite clear that no star appointed its own path of brightness. No
   flower can lift its head and say, "I created my own loveliness." No
   eagle that cuts the air can say, "I gave myself my soaring wings and my
   piercing eyes." God has made them all. And so, Sinner, you who are
   troubled because of your impotency--He wants nor needs no power in you.
   He gives power to the weak, and to them that have no might He increases
   strength. Rest upon God in Christ, and cast yourself on Him, and He
   will do it all.

   "Yes," you say again, "but I am in such an awful state of mind--there
   is such a confusion within me--Hell is opened from beneath and the
   sluices of my soul's sorrows are drawn up. Grief streams forth in
   rivers from my eyes. I cannot tell what is the matter with me. My heart
   is like a battleground torn up with the prancing of the horses. I know
   not what I am. I cannot understand myself." Pause, I pray, and answer
   me, Was not the world just so of old, and did not all the beauty of all
   lands rise out of this dire confusion? Cannot God, then, do this for
   you, and give you a peace that passes all understanding? I beseech you,
   my dear distressed Friend, trust in Christ, for He can hush the
   hurricane to slumber, and lay the storm to sleep.

   Let me remind you, O Enquirer, that there is more hope in your case
   than there was in the creation of the world, for in the creation there
   was nothing done beforehand. The plan was drawn, no doubt, but no
   material was provided, no stores laid in to effect the purpose. We read
   not that God had piled up a mass of nebulae that He worked out into
   worlds. No, He began the work and finished it without any previous
   preparations. But in your case the work is done already, beforehand. On
   the bloody tree Christ has carried sin. In the grave He has vanquished
   death. In His resurrection He has rent forever the bonds of the grave.
   In His ascension He has opened Heaven to all Believers.

   And in His intercession He is pleading still for them that trust Him.
   It is finished, remember, so that it is easier to save you than to make
   a world, for the world had nothing prepared for it. There was nothing
   ready--but here everything is ready and all you are bid to do is to
   come and sit at a feast that is already spread--to wear a garment that
   is already woven, to wash in a bath that is already filled with blood.
   Sinner, what do you say? Will you believe in God's Anointed or not?

   Yet again, remember that God has done something more in you than there
   was done before He made the world. Emptiness did not cry, "Oh, God,
   create me." Darkness could not pray, "Oh, Lord, give me light."
   Confusion could not cry, "Oh, God, ordain me into order." But see what
   He has done for you! He has taught you to cry, "Create in me a clean
   heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me." He has made you
   plead, "Lighten my darkness, O Lord, lest I sleep the sleep of death."
   He has taught you to say, "I have gone astray, like a lost sheep, seek
   Your servant." See, Friend, the grass cannot pray for dew, and yet it
   falls--and shall you cry for it, and God withhold it?

   The thirsty earth has no voice to ask for showers, and yet they
   descend, and will God let you cry and not answer you? Look at the
   forests in winter, they cannot ask for leaves, and yet the verdure
   comes in its season. Nor can the corn entreat for sunshine, and yet God
   gives good things to all in due season. And you, made in His own image,
   will He let you cry and not hear you? When He has Himself said, "As I
   live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of him that
   dies but would rather that he should turn unto Me and live"?

   Yet once again, and here is a rich thought of comfort--it was in God's
   power to make the world or not, just as He pleased. No promise bound
   Him. No Covenant made it imperative upon Him that His arm should be
   outstretched. Sinner, the Lord is not bound to save you except from His
   own promise--and that promise is--"He that calls upon the name of the
   Lord shall be saved." He cannot, He cannot withhold saving you if you
   call upon Him. His Covenant has bound Him to be merciful to those who
   confess their sins. He is merciful and just to forgive us our sins and
   to save us from all unrighteousness. This, then, is a case that
   glistens with brighter light than did the case of the uncreated world.
   And as, of His own will, without pledge or Covenant, He made the earth
   what it is--most surely now He has promised it--He will save you if you
   trust in Jesus.

   Once more here. It is certain that there is more room in your case for
   God to glorify Himself, than there was in the making of the world. In
   making the world He glorified His wisdom and He magnified His power.
   But He could not show His mercy. He could have no mercy upon floods and
   mountains, upon cattle and flying fowl. There was kindness, but no
   mercy, for they had not sinned. Now, here in your case, there is room
   for every attribute of God, for His loving-kindness, His faithfulness,
   His veracity, His power, His Grace. Yours is a hopeful case, because it
   is hopeless to you.

   There is room for God, because, certainly, there is no space for you.
   You can do nothing. It is your extremity, and it is, therefore, God's
   opportunity. What would I give this morning if I could turn one tearful
   eye away from itself to Christ! I know how foolish we all are that we
   all look to flesh and blood. Turn your eyes, Sinner, to the Cross where
   the Savior bleeds. Rest on Him--He, without whom was not anything made
   that was made, died for you. He who was in the beginning with God and
   who was God, works out your redemption. Trust Him and the work is done.
   Rest on Him and your soul is brought today into the realm of safety,
   and you have passed from death unto life.

   I will tell you a little anecdote which will show how foolish we are,
   when we depend on self. I have heard that lately, a ship on her way to
   Australia met with a very terrible storm and sprung a leak. And a
   little while after, a hurricane overtook her. There happened to be a
   gentleman on board, of the most nervous temperament that can be
   imagined, whose rambling tongue and important air were calculated to
   alarm all the passengers. When the storm came on, the captain, who knew
   what damage had been done, managed to get near him.

   And the gentleman said to the captain, "What an awful storm. I am
   afraid we shall go to the bottom, for I hear the leak is very bad."
   "Well," said the captain, "as you seem to know it, and perhaps the
   others do not, you had better not tell them, lest you should dispirit
   my men. Perhaps, as it is a very bad case, you would lend us your
   valuable aid and we may possibly get through it. Would you have the
   goodness to stand here and hold hard on this rope? Pray do not leave
   it, but pull as hard as ever you can till I tell you to let it go."

   So our friend clenched his fists and put his feet stiff down and kept
   on holding this rope with all his might for several hours. The storm
   abated. The ship was brought right and our friend let go of his rope.
   He expected a deputation would bring him the thanks of all the
   passengers but they were unconscious of his merits. He thought at least
   there would be a contribution for a trophy or plaque for what he had
   done but no plaque came. Even the captain did not seem very grateful,
   so he ventured, very distantly and in a roundabout style to hint that
   such valuable services as his, having saved the vessel, ought to be
   rewarded with some few words of gratitude, at any rate. He was shocked
   to hear the captain say, "What? Do you think you saved the vessel? Why,
   I gave you that rope to hold to keep you out of the way! You did a
   world of mischief till I got you quiet."

   So now, mark you, there are some people who are wanting to do so much.
   They think they can certainly save themselves, and there they stand,
   holding the rope with their clenched fists and their feet tightly
   fixed, while they are really doing no more than our poor friend. If
   ever you get to Heaven, you will find that everything you did towards
   your own salvation was about as useful as what this man did when he was
   holding the rope--the safety of the vessel lies somewhere else, and not
   in you. And that what is wanted with you is just to get you out of the
   way--and when you are out of the way, and are made a fool of, then
   Christ comes in and shows His wisdom. While, perhaps, all the while you
   are bemoaning yourself that you should be so badly treated, it would
   not have been possible for you to be saved unless you had been put out
   of the way, that Almighty God might do the work from first to last.

   III. And now I have to conclude with one or two words of ENCOURAGEMENT
   TO BELIEVERS.

   And so, my Brothers in Christ, you are greatly troubled are you? It is
   a common lot with us all. And so you have nothing on earth to trust to
   now, and are going to be cast on your God alone? Your vessel is on her
   beam-ends, and now there is nothing for you but just to be rolled on
   the Providence and care of God. What a blessed place to be rolled on!
   Happy storm that wrecks a man on such a Rock as this! O blessed
   hurricane that drives the soul to God, and God alone! On some few
   occasions I have had troubles which I could not tell to any but my God
   and I thank God that I have, for I learned more of my Lord then than at
   any other time.

   There is no getting at our God sometimes because of the multitude of
   our friends. But when a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless that
   he has nothing, he flies into his Father's arms and how blessedly he is
   clasped there! So that I say again, happy trouble that drives you to
   your Father! Blessed storm that wrecks you on the Rock of Ages!
   Glorious billow that washes you upon this heavenly shore! And now you
   have nothing but your God to trust to, what are you going to do? To
   fret? To whine? O, I pray you do not thus dishonor your Lord and
   Master! Now, play the man, play the man of God. Show the world that
   your God is worth ten thousand worlds to you.

   Show rich men how rich you are in your poverty when the Lord God is
   your Helper. Show the strong man how strong you are in your weakness
   when underneath you are the everlasting arms. Now Man, now Man, now is
   your time to glorify God! You know there was no room for your courage
   before, but now there is space for feats of faith and valiant exploits.
   Our present mode of warfare bids fair to annihilate courage altogether,
   for now men fight at such a distance that the hand-to-hand fight is
   impossible. But in those brave days of old, when the troops of Rupert
   and of Cromwell met hand-to-hand, when uphill the Puritanical legions
   spurred their horses against the hosts of "the man of blood"--then
   there was room for bravery!

   Then men could fight not at two miles' distance but foot-to-foot. Then
   there was room for the solitary bravo to lead the way against a
   multitude. Then the scaling ladder clicked on the top of the wall and
   the brave man of the forlorn hope went up it step by step, with his
   cutlass between his teeth, until he reached the top. Then men could
   make themselves famous. But now, what with iron ships, and large
   Armstrong guns, there is hardly room for men to be courageous. But,
   Believer, you, in your lonely distress, have returned to "the brave
   days of old."

   When you had your regular income from the Consuls, when your business
   prospered, when you had your children and your friends about you, why
   there was no room for you to perform heroic deeds of resignation and
   trust! But now you are stripped, now at it, for your foes are before
   you. When the Duke of Wellington asked a soldier what kind of dress he
   would like to wear if he had to fight another Waterloo--"Please, Your
   Grace," said the man, "I'd like to fight in my shirtsleeves." Well now,
   you have come to that. You have nothing now to encumber you. You can
   fight in your shirtsleeves, and now is the time to win the victory. Be
   strong and very courageous, and the Lord your God shall certainly, as
   surely as He built the heavens and the earth, glorify Himself in your
   weakness and magnify His might in the midst of your distress.

   The Lord help us to lean wholly on Him and never on ourselves. And let
   His name be had in remembrance while the earth endures. Amen and Amen.

               Sermon 463. Christ'S Servant--His Duty And Reward

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 3, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "If any man serve Me, let him follow Me. And where I am, there shall
   also My servant be: if any man serve Me, him will My Father honor."
   John 12:26.

   How many persons are of the religion of the Greeks who are mentioned in
   this chapter! They would see Jesus, but they would not serve Him.
   Impelled by curiosity they would know somewhat of this matter. They
   would investigate the claims of Christ to the Messiahship, and they
   would consider the special truths by which He professes to illuminate
   the world--but beyond this they would not venture. They give their
   minds to criticize. They are not indifferent to the Gospel, but they
   regard it with the same interest as that with which a naturalist would
   look upon a newly discovered insect, or a geologist would study a
   section of the earth's crust.

   But as to personally feeling the hallowed influence of the Truth of
   God, they know not what it means. Many of these Greeks proceed much
   further. They feel an admiration for the character and teaching of
   Jesus, and they express that admiration in honest, warm praise. But see
   how hollow is their appreciation--they applaud the Person whom they
   scorn to obey. They admire teachings which they will not practice. They
   listen to the Divine Word, but they are hearers only, and not doers of
   the Truth of God.

   Probably there are numbers in this assembly to whom the Christian
   religion has always been a subject of respectful interest. They have
   never blasphemed the name of Christ. They have not doubted the
   inspiration of Scripture. No, they have studied God's Word. They have
   given a degree of attention to its doctrines, and they intend yet more
   fully to examine its revelations. How pleasant and hopeful are such
   marks of interest--but how far are many of these enquirers from true
   discipleship--for their unhumbled hearts are not obedient to the
   dictates of the Gospel. The Cross is to them too heavy a load to carry.
   They have not made up their minds to wear "Christ's yoke." They had
   rather see His holiness, and see His disciples imitate Him than
   themselves take up the cross daily and follow Him.

   My Hearers, allow me to remind you very solemnly that a speculative
   religion which has curiosity as its impulse, a search after knowledge
   as its rule, and self-esteem as its root, can never save the soul. It
   is not for you to criticize, but to repent. It is not for you to judge
   but to believe. It is not for you to admire, but to obey. It is not for
   you to praise and applaud, but cheerfully to bow your necks to imitate
   and follow Christ. Nothing short of a religion which subjects us to
   personal service of Christ, which gives us a new heart, and a right
   spirit, and compels us to feel that we are not our own but bought with
   a price--nothing short of this will ever give lasting peace of mind, or
   bring us to the place where we shall see the face of God with delight.

   Many proudly dream that to serve Christ would be dishonorable, and that
   they would demean themselves by becoming humble followers of the Lamb.
   Let me remind them that those whose opinions we esteem did not think
   that. Even a heathen could say, "To serve God is to reign." We know
   that most noble of men, Moses, before the coming of John the
   Baptist--the greatest that had ever been born of woman--Moses, the king
   in Jeshurun, and the leader of God's hosts, has as his highest
   title--"Moses, the servant of God."

   And even our Lord and Master, whose shoe latchet we are not worthy to
   unloose, took upon Himself the form of a servant, and though He were a
   Son, yet learned obedience by the things that He suffered. Since the
   days of our Redeemer, the greatest in the Church of Christ have been
   the servants of all, and those who have attained to the highest
   dignities and honors which it is in the power of Christ's Church to
   confer, have been those who joyfully stooped to the most menial
   occupations. They were willing to be less than the least, and became
   the greatest of all.

   Let us imitate Him who was "King of kings," and yet a "Servant of
   servants." Let us follow Him who is girt about the paps with a golden
   girdle, and wraps the light about Him as a garment--and yet He unrobed
   Himself--and took a towel, like a servant, that He might wash His
   disciples' feet. The motto of the Prince of Wales is "Ich dieri"--"I
   serve." It should be the motto of every prince of the royal blood of
   Heaven. Let every Christian write this now upon his crest--"I serve,"
   and, from this day forth, wherever he is, let him not seek lordship.
   Let him leave that to the Gentiles, and to a carnal world, but let him
   seek ministry and service, being willing to do anything or to be
   anything by which he may profit the body of Christ, which is the
   Church.

   We will now endeavor, as the Blessed Spirit shall aid us, to expound
   His three-fold teaching. You will mark, first of all, plain directions
   for a very honorable office--"If any man serve Me, let him follow Me."
   In the second place, most generous stipulations from a noble
   Master--"Where I am, there shall also My servant be." And thirdly, most
   glorious rewards for imperfect services--"If any man serve Me, him will
   My Father honor."

   I. We have here PLAIN DIRECTIONS FOR A VERY HONORABLE OFFICE. "If any
   man serve Me, let him follow Me." A golden precept, written on a tablet
   of ivory.

   I speak the sentiments of the majority of those present when I say, we
   would all of us like to minister to Christ. We feel that if He were
   here now, there would be nothing which we would not do for Him. The
   word used in our text three times might very properly be translated
   thus--"If any man would act the part of a deacon towards Me, let him
   follow Me. And where I am there shall also My deacon be. And he that
   acts as a deacon towards Me shall be honored of My Father." The word
   "deacon" in the original Greek means nothing but a servant, and every
   deacon should be the cheerful, laborious and faithful servant of the
   Church.

   Now, what was the part of a deacon in the early Church? It was service
   to the people of God of all sorts and kinds. Who among us would blush
   to be the deacons of Christ, His body servants, His attendants? Would
   we not wait upon Him? We would be His servants to the very fullest
   extent. I think we should consider ourselves ennobled for life if we
   might cast our garments in the way, that He might be saved from a muddy
   place in the road. Would we not feed Him? There should be such a feast
   in our house as never was before! We would submit to hunger ourselves,
   if we might but supply His wants.

   And I think if the twelve poor fishermen were with Him, we would not
   shut one of them out, but ask them all home. We ourselves would leave
   our houses and stand in the street all night to let them have rest. For
   we feel that, if the Blessed One were here, it were so high an honor to
   contribute in any degree to His comfort, or to show in any way our
   respect for Him, that nothing would be too hard--nothing impossible for
   us to perform. Permit me to say, however, that very much of this is
   mere sentiment. In fact, we do not know ourselves. And, in the case of
   many here present, if Christ were here in the same guise in which He
   came the first time, they would not receive Him, but the reverse.

   Their doors would be shut in His face and, perhaps, they might even
   join in the bloodthirsty cry of, "Let Him be crucified!" All this talk
   of generosity and homage to be offered to Jesus, is to a great extent,
   mere sentiment--mere talk-- and we would do no such thing when it came
   to the practical push. For, mark me, if we really would do these
   things, we can do them now. If it is true that we would minister to
   Christ, and be servants and deacons towards Him, it is in our power to
   do so now as much as if He were on earth. And, inasmuch as we live in
   the neglect of this duty, we must not delude ourselves into the notion
   that if such-and-such a thing should happen, we should act differently
   from what we do now.

   This sentimentalism about entertaining Christ has at the bottom of it
   the idea that we should be honoring ourselves by it. Now this is not
   the spirit that gives a worthy friendship towards Christ. He that loves
   Christ really serves Him, not to be honored by Him, but to give Him
   honor. We, indeed, would gladly receive the Lord into our guest
   chamber, because men would say of us--"He entertained the Lord of
   Glory! He was honored with His company!" But, oh, if, instead, men
   would say--"Yonder fool disgraced himself by harboring the mendicant
   impostor. He entertained the man whom we call Beelzebub," I think there
   are many who now talk so well of Christ who would decline the privilege
   of entertaining Jesus if all the world were against Him.

   But, dear Friends, I say again, if any of you would serve Christ, it is
   now in your power, for the directions given are meant for all time, and
   may be carried out today. It seems from my text that to follow Christ,
   or to imitate Him, is really to serve Him. I think we can plainly see
   this. "Oh," says one, I should like to do something to prove that I
   really would obey my Lord. I profess to be His servant and I would show
   that I am not a servant in name, only, but that whatever my

   Master says to me, that I will do." Well, the opportunity is before you
   today--imitate Christ and then prove your obedience. This command may
   be summed up in this--"Be like I am."

   If you would know what He would have you do, see what He did Himself.
   His own life is your Law, written in living characters. No better proof
   can you give that you are not a lip server, but a real disciple than by
   diligently and scrupulously copying Christ even to the least jot and
   tittle. "Oh," says another, "I would joyfully assist Him in His wants.
   I would supply Him with bread. I would give Him the cup of cold water
   to drink. I would not let Him say again, 'The foxes have holes and the
   birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man has not where to lay His
   head.' I would never let Him want."

   Imitate Him, then, and you can do it, for what did He do but distribute
   of his substance to the poor? Did He not care for the wants of all men?
   Is it not written of Him, "He went about doing good"? If you would
   supply His wants, behold Him in His poor saints. If you would feed Him,
   feed the mouths of His hungry children. If you would clothe Him, clothe
   the backs of His naked ones. If you would succor Him, relieve the poor,
   the widow, and the fatherless--and those that have no helper. Imitate
   Him in the generousness of His life--care for the wants of men. Follow
   Him in this, and you will have served Him in supplying His wants--

   "Lord, You have Brethren here below,
   Flesh of Your flesh through Grace.
   Teach us to see You in your saints,
   Your sorrows in their face.
   In them You may be clothed and fed,
   And visited and cheered--
   And in their accents of distress
   My Savior's voice is heard.
   Your face, with reverence and with love,
   We in Your poor would see!
   O let us rather beg our bread
   Than keep it back from You."

   "But," says another, "I would do something to cheer Him. I think if He
   were here I would endeavor to smooth a few of the furrows from His
   marred brow. I would labor to make the heart of the Man of Sorrows
   rejoice in some measure, and be glad in some degree. I would lay down
   my life to give Him peace who is my soul's peace and rest." You can do
   it. You can do it. If you would serve Him thus, and cheer His heart,
   follow Him. This is the solace of His sorrow, the reward of His
   labors--the obedience of His children to His commands. This is the
   spoil which He divides with the mighty. This is the prey which He takes
   from the strong--that all His saints should be like He is in all
   righteousness and true holiness.

   This is the travail of His soul which He sees and is satisfied--when
   you are conformed to His image and show forth His character among the
   sons of men. Oh, if you are Christ-like, you have done more to make
   Christ happy than all the songs of the angels. If men shall say of you,
   "That man has been with Jesus and has learned of Him," you have given
   Jesus better music than cherubim and seraphim can yield.

   "Yes," I hear another say, "but I would honor Him. If He were here I
   would climb the trees and strew the branches in His way. How would I
   gladly run before Him and cry, "Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna! Blessed is
   He that comes in the name of the Lord!" Would you thus serve Him, by
   honoring Him, and extolling His name? You can do it. Follow Him. Live
   as He lived. Act as He acted, and you have honored Him more completely
   than by strewing palm branches or throwing your clothes in the road.
   For when is Christ most honored? When His saints are most sanctified.
   When is His name the most esteemed? When the sons of God walk the most
   carefully, the most prayerfully, and the most closely with their God.
   You can today serve Christ if you will today humbly take His plain
   directions, exactly imitate His Example, and closely follow in His
   steps.

   Beloved Friends, I think we have made it clear enough that there is a
   possibility of serving Christ, of deacon zing towards Christ by the
   imitation of His Character. Now I quoted the Greek word "deacon zing"
   because it was the means, when I was looking into the verse, of giving
   me an illustration of this subject. You remember that on the first
   Sunday of last month we had in our midst, the venerable Mar Yohanan, a
   presbyter of the Nestorian Church at Oroomiah. And with him was a
   deacon whose name was Mar Isaak. These two men had performed an almost
   incredible journey.

   They had walked the entire distance from the borders of Persia--over
   the mountains of Armenia and Circassia-- across the steppes of Russia.
   And from Russia right through Prussia, Germany and Holland, till at
   last they arrived in London. Now, I could not help but notice how the
   deacon, the servant, carefully attended in all things to the venerable
   presbyter whom we saw among us. How he marked his every look that he
   might not for a moment appear to neglect his reverend leader. Probably
   on that day when Yohanan the presbyter, first thought of this journey,
   he addressed Isaak thus--"Isaak, are you a true servant?" "Yes," says
   he, "ever since the Church made me deacon I have loved you as my own
   soul, and I would gladly do anything for your comfort."

   "Then," says he, "If you would serve me, follow me." "But must I leave
   my children and my household?" "Verily," says the presbyter; "it must
   even be so, for I, also, shall leave behind me my wife and children,
   and go forth on a long and weary journey--many a hundred miles, to
   Britain, where there are many who love our Lord, and who may help the
   persecuted saints in this region." Now came the pinch, and Isaak, if he
   would serve the presbyter, must follow him. He does not decline the
   service. When he accepted the office of the deacon, he resolved to
   really be the servant of the Church and her minister. And he is now
   ready to undertake the journey with his presbyter.

   I think I see them sallying forth. They journey among the Kurds, a
   savage people always thirsting for the Christians' blood--with more
   than Mohammedan hatred of Christ. Perhaps Isaak is faint-hearted and
   would like to turn back. "If any man would serve me, let him follow
   me," says the hoary presbyter, as he strikes his staff upon the ground
   and advances fearless of the foe. They pass one danger and encounter
   another. A mountain is in their way lifting its snowy crest even to the
   sky. The gray-bearded preacher goes first, and he cries, "Isaak, if you
   would serve me, follow me." And on they go, climbing from crag to crag,
   along the unfrequented path where scarce the wild goat has found a
   footing.

   Soon they travel through the valley and across the barren, snowy,
   pathless wilderness, the presbyter saying continually, "Brother, if you
   would deaconize towards me, follow me, for now it is that it shall be
   proved to the world that you are a true servant of the Church and are
   willing to follow the presbyter to the world's end." He did follow him
   right faithfully, and they reached their journey's end together. Now,
   this is just what Jesus Christ says to us. We are all His deacons, His
   servants. We all became engaged, in the day when we gave ourselves to
   Him, that we would take up our cross and follow Him. And He points
   today to some high mountain, saying, "If you would serve Me, follow
   Me."

   He does not ask you to lead. He Himself has gone before. He calls you
   to no labor which He has not Himself already accomplished. Oh, can you
   say in your heart today--

   "Through floods and flames if Jesus leads, I'll follow where He goes.
   'Hinder me not,' shall be my cry, Though earth and Hell oppose"? This
   is true service, the best that can be rendered, to follow where He
   leads the way, let the way be never so rough or arduous, to persevere
   to the end, even though the end be a martyr's death.

   Come, Brethren, and especially those who are beginners, and have but
   lately enlisted in Christ's cause--let me mark you out Christ's way,
   and then--if you would serve Him, follow Him. I know the proud flesh
   wants to serve Christ by striking out new paths. Proud man has a desire
   to preach new doctrines, to set up a new Church--to be an original
   thinker, to judge and consider--do anything but obey. This is not
   service to Christ. He that would serve Christ must follow Him. He must
   be content to tread only in the old footsteps and go only where Christ
   has led the way. It is not for you and me to be originals. We must be
   humble copies of Christ.

   There must be nothing about our religion of our own inventing. It is
   for us to lay thought, and judgment, and opinion at the feet of
   Christ--and do what HE bids us--simply because He gives the command.
   Look, then, disciples, at your Lord. I think I see the Savior--oh, that
   you would follow Him today! I think I see Him coming. It is His first
   public entry in the world. And where does He go? It is the beginning of
   His manifest ministry among men. He is about to show you what should be
   the beginning of yours.

   He goes to Jordan. There stands the Baptist, and the willing crowds are
   baptized with the Baptism of repentance. As John stands there, lo, the
   Son of Man Himself appears. And John says, "I have need to be baptized
   of You and come You to me?" But our Master, whom if we would serve, we
   must follow, says, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becomes us to
   fulfill all righteousness." He descends into the stream. He is buried
   beneath the water. And as he comes up from that immersion, the Heaven
   is opened and the Spirit descends upon Him like a dove.

   If you would serve Him, follow Him. "But.. .but.. .but!" Alas, my
   Brothers and Sisters, this is not a fitting word for a disciple--you
   forget your service when you begin to question. If you would serve Him,
   follow Him. Your business as a servant is not to object, but to obey.
   Imagine that you ask your servant to fill a bath with water. "But." You
   say, "I must have it filled." But she questions again, and again, and
   again, and at last flatly refuses to do more than sprinkle it with a
   few drops. Do you call her a servant any longer? Methinks no.

   So there are some of you who see most clearly that your Master was
   baptized at the commencement of His public life, and yet you will be
   raising questions where there is no room for questions. You will
   neglect a duty which is as plain in Scripture as the very Deity of
   Christ. You will turn aside from a Baptism which is as plainly taught
   in express words as even the doctrine of justification by faith--you do
   not take up your service as you should.

   "But, it is not essential," you say. Is that a servant's business? "But
   what good will it do?" Is this a question for a servant? "If any man
   will serve Me"--Christ does not say--"Let him question Me. Let him be
   asking Me why I command him to do such a thing." No, no! He says, "Let
   him follow Me." "But I dread the publicity, I fear the ordinance." It
   is your proud flesh that fears it--subdue it under your feet and take
   up your cross, for there are far heavier crosses than this to carry.
   Thus your Master puts it--"If any man will serve Me, let him follow
   Me."

   He now comes from Jordan and the Spirit leads Him into the wilderness
   to be tempted of the devil. You, too, must be tempted. Do not think
   when you are tempted that, therefore, you are out of Christ. No--if you
   would be His servant, you must follow Him, and must be tempted, too.
   You must be assailed in many points. The arrows must fly from above and
   from beneath. You must be tried on all hands and in all ways. Run not
   from the conflict, for if any man would serve Christ, he must follow
   Him through the hottest temptations as well as through the brightest
   joys.

   Now the Master comes forth boldly and begins to preach and teach and
   labor. If you would serve Him, follow Him! Labor for Him. In some way
   or other teach His Gospel. If you cannot teach it to the thousands,
   teach it to the tens. It you cannot converse with multitudes, converse
   with one at the well, as Christ did at Sychar. If you would be His
   servant, let His life, written in large letters, be your life. And let
   your life be the miniature, the condensation of the life of Christ. --
   "If any man would serve Me, let him follow Me."

   You see the Master bears bold witness before His adversaries. He beards
   the Pharisee to His face. He upbraids the hypocrites who oppose Him.
   Follow Him, if you would serve Him. Let there not be a single foe
   before whose face you would fear His cause to plead. Speak up for His
   name. Let no blush suffuse your cheeks. Speak His name before kings,
   nor yield to sinful shame. But see, the Master comes into the black
   cloud of reproach--they say He has a devil, and is mad. Follow Him
   there. Now, you servants of God, now is the trying hour. Now follow
   Him. Be rejected and despised, and hooted at with Him and sing as you
   go through it all--

   "If on my face, for Your dear name, Shame and reproach shall be, I'll
   hail reproach and welcome shame, If You'll remember me."

   Look, He comes to die. If you would serve Him, follow Him. Be ready to
   be brought before the judgment seat for His name. Be ready to yield
   your life up at His command, and if the martyr days should ever return,
   give your blood as freely as you would give water from the well. Or if
   they come not, spend that blood, and the life it gives them, devoting
   every hour of every day, and every moment of every hour, to His cause,
   whose you are, and whom you do profess to serve. No new fashions, no
   new views and opinions--the imitation of Christ is the only mode of
   service, and the Master lays it down before each of you. Ask your
   consciences whether you have ever really served Him--"If any man would
   serve Me, let him follow Me."

   Walk in the way of Christ, it is the King's highway. I pass the
   question round these galleries, and this vast area--Are you serving
   Christ? "Well, I subscribe to a charity." Are you serving Christ? "I
   intend to build a row of almshouses." My dear Brothers and Sisters, you
   may do all this and yet not be serving Christ, for your Master tells
   you that to serve Him is to follow Him. Have you followed Him? Have you
   believed in Him? Is He All in All to you, and do you now make His life
   the guiding star of your life? And do you desire to be, and are you, as
   far as is possible to man--made like He in all things--that you may be
   obedient unto His will? God help us that desiring to serve Immanuel, we
   may do it by following Him!

   II. We must come to our second point--GENEROUS STIPULATIONS FROM A
   NOBLE MASTER. "Where I am, there shall also My servant be." Whoever
   heard of such conditions as these from an ordinary master? The master
   is in the drawing room, the servant is in the kitchen. The master is in
   the parlor, the servant is in the workshop. The master sits at the
   table with his friends, the servant girds himself to wait on them.
   What, I say, what generous stipulations does the master make--"Where I
   am, there shall also My servant be"!

   Well now, to return to the illustration we used before--"Where I am,
   there shall also my deacon be"--still using old Yohanan and Isaak as
   your pattern, you will remember that wherever the old presbyter went,
   there was Isaak at his side. I dare say many a night they slept under
   the broad shadow of a tree, and where Yohanan was, there the deacon
   was, too. Were they entertained by generous friends? They shared the
   same couch. At times they sat around the genial fire, but they sat
   together. Other times they shivered in the winter's cold--but they
   shivered side by side. Their lot during the long journey was the same.
   And when they arrived here they sat with us at the same table. We spoke
   to them as to those who were intimate friends, and I know that
   throughout the whole of their voyage, where the presbyter was, there
   the deacon was, also.

   Do you not see that this was the rule which Christ carried out all His
   life? He went to a wedding--is it not written, the disciples of Jesus
   were there? Jesus once rejoiced in spirit over the elect ones, the
   babes and sucklings to whom God had revealed Himself--yes, but His
   disciples shared the joy, because Satan fell like lightning from
   Heaven--and even the devils were subject to them. The Master often went
   to the house of Lazarus. And Martha and Mary made a great feast-- but
   the disciples were always there. Sometimes they went to a Pharisee's
   house--a very respectable gentleman--and if Christ had been an ordinary
   man he might have said, "I cannot take those poor fishermen with Me. It
   will lower My character if they see what rag tags follow at My heels."
   But no, where He was, there His servants were.

   And you know, Beloved, one time He rode in triumph through the streets
   of Jerusalem. But He did not say to His disciples, "Now you had better
   keep out of the way. This is a day in which I am to be honored, and I
   think you will rather spoil the pageantry if they see you in your
   fishermen's dress walking with Me." No--where He was, there were His
   servants, also. And when the multitudes cried, "Hosanna," and welcomed
   the Master, the welcome was shared by the disciples. Then there came
   His last great feast. "With desire," said He, have I desired to eat
   this Passover with you"--it was "with you"--He could not enjoy that
   last supper except with them. "Where I am, there shall also My servant
   be." Share and share alike. Their lot, My lot. My portion, their
   portion forever.

   Mark, Beloved, if the Lord thus shared His comforts among His
   disciples, He expected them to share His discomforts. He was in a ship
   in a great storm, and the disciples must be with Him, though they are
   sorely afraid. He goes to Gethsemane. He sweats, as it were, great
   drops of blood. His disciples must be with Him there, even though they
   cannot bear it, and are asleep. And though in His last passion they
   could not be with Him, for He must tread the winepress alone, yet, mark
   you, His disciples were with Him afterwards, for if He were brought
   before kings, so were they. If He stood falsely accused, so, in after
   years, did they. If He died upon the Cross a martyr, so did they!

   And so, for three hundred years, where Christ was in death, there His
   Church was, too, for the gibbet and the cross and the stake and the
   block, and the bloody axe had stern work to do with Christ's Church,
   that it might be fulfilled-- "Where I am, there shall also My servant
   be."

   Beloved, this stands true to you and me this morning. Where Christ was
   we must be. "The disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant
   above his Lord." Blessed be His name, He is gone to Heaven, now, and
   where He is, there shall His servants be, in the same Heaven in His
   Father's house. Yes, He has mounted to His Throne, and where He is,
   there shall His servants be. "To Him that overcomes will I give to sit
   on My Throne, even as I have overcome and have sat down upon My
   Father's Throne." He is in the joy of His Father. And where He is,
   there must His servants be.

   We also must be partakers of His joy that His joy may be full. Lo, He
   comes! The trumpet sounds! Jesus comes! The second advent draws near.
   But when He comes, all His saints shall come with Him. My God shall
   come, and all His saints with Him. He reigns--kings and princes, your
   scepters are not your own. He comes to take them from your hands and
   your crowns from your heads--Jesus comes to "reign from pole to pole
   with illimitable sway." And we shall reign with Him, for, "Where I am,
   there also shall My servant be."

   I think you understand, then, that the conditions of the service are
   these--fare ill or fare well--we are to have joint stock with Christ.
   We are to take Him for better or for worse, in shame and in honor, in
   reproach and in esteem, in riches and in poverty, in life and in death,
   in time and in eternity. "Where I am, there shall also My servant be."
   I love my Master's conditions! He is a noble Master! Shall I ever blush
   to go where He goes? God forbid, for if I do, I may be afraid lest at
   the last He should ignore me and should not permit me to be where He
   is.

   I have heard an old story, somewhat amusing, which will illustrate this
   point, and then I shall leave it. I have heard that a noted Methodist
   preacher, who commenced his ministry very early in life, suffered not a
   little at first because of his humble origin and unpromising exterior.
   Being sent on the circuit to a certain house on a Saturday night, to be
   in readiness for preaching on the Sunday, the good woman, who did not
   like the look of him, sent him round to the kitchen. There was a
   manservant who served them at odd times, and also worked in the coal
   mine, or at the forge, who was surprised to see the minister in the
   kitchen with him when he came from labor.

   John, rough as he was, welcomed the despised preacher, and tried to
   cheer his heart. The minister shared John's meal of porridge, John's
   bed in the cockloft and John's humble breakfast. He walked to the House
   of God with John in the morning. Now, the preacher was a notable man,
   though then unknown, and he had not long opened his mouth before the
   congregation perceived that there was something in him, and the good
   hostess, who had so badly entertained him, began to feel a little
   uneasy. When the sermon was over there were many invitations for the
   minister to come visit, and the hostess, fearful of losing her now
   honored guest, begged him to walk home with her.

   To her surprise, he said, "I supped with John, I slept with John, I
   breakfasted with John. I walked here with John, and I'll walk home with
   John." So when dinner came he was, of course, entreated to come into
   the chief room, for many friends wished to dine with this young
   minister, who was so much admired and esteemed. But no, he would dine
   in the kitchen. He had supped with John, he had breakfasted with John,
   and he would dine with John. They begged him to come into the parlor
   and at last he consented on the condition that John should sit at the
   same table. "For," he said, very properly, "John was with me in my
   humiliation, and I will not sit down to dine unless he is with me in my
   exaltation."

   So on he went till the Monday morning, sleeping at night with John, and
   persevering in the same rule--"I supped with John, I slept with John, I
   breakfasted with John, I walked with John, I'll walk home with John,
   and I'll dine with John, for John was with me at the beginning and he
   shall be with me to the end."

   Brethren, this story may be turned to account thus: Our Master came
   into this world once, and they sent Him into the servants' place. They
   sent Him where the poor and despised ones were, and said, "Live with
   them. The manger and the cottage are good enough for You." He lived
   with poverty and supped with toil. Now the name of Christ is honored,
   and kings and cardinals, popes and bishops, say, "Master, come and dine
   with us." Yes, the proud emperor and philosopher would have Him sup
   with them. But still He says--"No, I was with the poor and afflicted
   when I was on earth, and I will be with them to the end. And when the
   great feast is made in Heaven, the humble shall sit with Me and the
   poor and despised who were not ashamed of Me, of them will I not be
   ashamed when I come in the glory of My Father and all My holy angels
   with Me."

   III. We have, thirdly, A GLORIOUS REWARD FOR IMPERFECT SERVICES. "If
   any man serve Me, him will My Father honor."

   If any man will serve Christ in the way Christ bids him, that is, by
   following Him. If any man is content not to do as father or grandmother
   did, but will follow Christ and not man. If any man will break through
   all customs, all regulations, all rotten proprieties, and just do as
   Christ did, and imitate Him in all things--that man will have honor,
   first of all, in his own soul. He shall have such blessed peace of
   conscience, he shall have such sweet fellowship with Christ, he shall
   have such profound peace from the Father's right hand, that it shall be
   very apparent to him that the Father honors him.

   Look at John Knox, who never feared the face of man. He followed Christ
   as far as his light went, and how greatly the Father honored him with
   unruffled serenity of heart. What calm that gigantic spirit had! When
   the world was all in uproar against him, how peacefully he smiled in
   the face of the roaring of the multitude, for God honored him with an
   indwelling consciousness of being right before the Lord.

   Then, again, I am persuaded that God will honor such a man by success,
   by prospering him in his ministry and in whatever he may attempt for
   Christ. Why is it that so little success rests on some who labor for
   God? Because they do not serve Christ in the way He would have them
   serve Him--by imitating Him. Ecclesiastical courts, rubrics, rules,
   forms, liturgies, and such like, confine too many, who if they would
   snap the fetter, would be honored of the Lord. If there were in
   connection with this Church anything which I thought to be
   unscriptural, I could not expect to have God's blessing in it.

   And I think if any man here is a member of a Church of which he can
   say, "Well, there are many wrong things in it, but I do not think I
   ought to come out," you cannot expect God's blessing. He that would
   serve Christ, must follow Christ in little things as well as in great
   things. Whenever we say, "Well, there are some things wrong in my
   position but I can do more good where I am," we set ourselves up as
   masters instead of servants. Our business is conscientiously to follow,
   as far as our light goes, the example of Christ in every respect, and
   in all things. And if this should entail the giving up of our present
   position and usefulness, we must not consider results, but instantly
   obey imperative commands.

   I claim for my Master immediate, unquestioning, unqualified obedience
   to all His Words. And I demand of you, in His name, that you renounce
   everything which prevents your rendering perfect, unhesitating service
   to His Person and doctrine. Whether as members of a Church, or a
   community, or in a trade, if you have anything that prevents your
   following Christ, leave everything and come right out--for you cannot
   expect great success from God till you have honored Christ by following
   Him in all things. If you think you know better than Christ, why then I
   have done with you. If you think that you can lead a better life, or
   set a better example, you are proud, indeed! Or, if you imagine that in
   your position you may tolerate yourselves in disobeying His commands,
   you talk as one of the foolish women talks but not as a disciple of
   Christ. I say again, if you would be honored of God, you must serve
   Christ by following Him.

   And lastly, such who thus serve Christ, by following Him, shall have
   great honor at the last. We will suppose that the Prince of Wales is
   wrecked on a certain voyage and is cast on shore with only one
   companion. The prince falls into the hands of barbarians and there is
   an opportunity for his companion to escape. But he says, "No, my
   Prince, I will stay with you to the last, and if we die, we will die
   together." The prince is thrown into a dungeon. His companion is in the
   prison with him, and serves him, and waits upon him. The prince is
   sick--it is a contagious fever--his companion nurses him--puts the
   cooling liquid to his mouth--and waits on him with a mother's care.

   He recovers a little. The fond attendant carries the young prince, as
   he is getting better, into the open air, and tends him as a mother
   would her child. They are subject to deep poverty--they share their
   last crust together. They are hooted at as they go through the streets,
   and they are hooted at together. At last, by some turn in Providence,
   it is discovered where the prince is, and he is brought home. Who is
   the man that the queen will delight to honor? "Make way for this man.
   He was with my son in prison--he was with my son when he was near
   death--he nursed him--he suffered with him--he was reproached for him."
   I fancy she would look with greater affection upon the poor servant
   than upon the greatest statesman. And I think that as long as she lived
   she would remember him above all the rest, for she would say, "He was
   with my son in all his sorrow and affliction, and I will honor him
   above all the mighty ones in the land."

   And now dear Brothers and Sisters, if you and I shall be with Christ,
   the King's Son. If we shall suffer with Him, and be reproached with
   Him. If we shall follow Him anywhere and everywhere, making no choice
   about the way, whether it shall be rough or smooth, whether it shall be
   green sward or miry bog--if we can go with Him to prison and to death,
   if such times come--then we shall be the men whom Heaven's King
   delights to honor. "Make room for him, you angels! Make room you
   cherubim and seraphim! Stand back you peers of Heaven's realm! Here
   comes the man. He was poor, mean and afflicted. But he was with My Son
   and was like My Son. Come here, Man! Here, take your crown and sit with
   My Son in His glory, for you were with My Son in His shame!" Oh that
   the Holy Spirit would teach us how to follow Jesus and enable us to
   tread in His steps!

   I conclude by again asking this important question--Are you with Christ
   today? Have you put your hand into Christ's hand to be Christ's
   forever? My Hearers, the speaker wants to make this question ring in
   your ears--Are you with Christ today? For he that is not with Him is
   against Him. And he that follows not Christ scatters abroad. Do you
   trust Christ? Oh, Sinner, if you do not, I beseech you trust Him now,
   and you are saved. If you have trusted Christ, is it the true trust? If
   it is, it will make you follow Him and you will be obedient to His
   every wish and word. Faith, such as the Holy Spirit gives, always leads
   to obedience.

   Is it so? Is it so? If not, humble yourself before God. Believe in Him
   who is the only foundation upon which a sinner's hope can be built.
   Take up your cross daily, and through evil report and through good
   report, follow the Master even to the end, and the Lord God, the God of
   Heaven and earth, the fountain of honor, shall glorify you when Christ
   comes in His kingdom.

                             A Sermon For Gleaners

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 10, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the
   sheaves, and reproach her not. And let fall also some of the handfuls
   on purpose for her and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke
   her not." Ruth 2:15,16.

   ALL the world depends upon the labor of the field and the king himself
   is served of the plow and of the sickle. The dwellers in the country
   who watch the springing up of the blade through all its perils, who
   mark the ear as it bursts from its sheath, and who anxiously observe it
   until it hangs downward through ripeness and becomes yellow in the
   sun-- these, being brought constantly into contact with clods and
   crops--are not able to forget their entire dependence upon the staff of
   life. One can hardly live where the operations of farming are carried
   on without often looking up to the God of Providence in anxious prayer
   and later, lilting up the heart in grateful praise.

   But the most of us are condemned to live in this huge wilderness of
   bricks, where scarcely a green thing salutes our eyes. If we try to
   rear a plant, it is but a sickly thing, neither tempting for beauty,
   nor fragrant with perfume. In the absence of the bright-eyed flowers,
   it is small wonder if we grow a little blind towards our mother earth.
   We are too apt to think that we are independent of the operations of
   the country. That our trade, our commerce, our manufactures, are
   sufficient to support us. We forget, all the while, that in vain is
   yonder forest of masts unless the earth shall yield her fruit. In vain
   the emporium, the exchange, and the place of merchandise, unless the
   land is plowed and harrowed, and at last yields to the farmer his
   reward.

   I would that I could recall to your memories, O you dwellers in the
   city, how much you depend upon the Lord God of the earth for your daily
   bread. Does your food fall like manna from the skies? Do you create it
   at the forge, or fashion it in the loom or on the wheel? Comes it not
   of the earth, and is it not the Lord who gives to the fertile womb of
   earth the power to yield its harvests? Comes not the dew from Heaven,
   and the sunshine from above? And do not these bring to us our bread as
   well as to those who abide in the midst of the fields?

   Let us not forget this time of the harvest, nor be unthankful for the
   bounty of the wheat. Let us not forget to plead with God that He would
   be pleased to give us suitable weather for the ingathering of the
   precious grain. And when it shall be ingathered, let us not sullenly
   keep silence, but with the toiling workers who, well-pleased, behold
   the waving yellow crop, let us lift up the shout of "Harvest Home," and
   thank the God who covers the valleys with corn and crowns the year with
   His goodness.

   I would order my speech, this morning, so as to act in your ears as the
   Harvest bell in our midland counties. I have there noticed a bell
   ringing early in the morning, and again towards the evening, which, I
   am told, is intended to tell the people the hour when they may go into
   the fields to glean, and when they must leave the field and go back to
   their homes. My sermon shall be as simple as the ringing of a bell. If
   it suffices to remind you of the sheaves and of the harvest, if it
   shall but make you thank our God who gives us the fruit of the earth, I
   shall be well content.

   Tell me not that this is not a proper theme for the Sunday. I know you
   know not what you say. Did not the disciples of Jesus walk through the
   corn fields on the Sunday and did not the Master make the fields
   themselves the subjects of His sermons? I fear not His disapprobation
   when I say, on this hallowed day, "Lift up now your eyes and behold the
   fields are ripe already unto the harvest." Do you think that the
   outward creation is sinful and that God would be worshipped on Sundays
   with closed eyes and vacant faces, which must not look on flowers and
   fields? There is no impurity in green grass, or flowers, or sailing
   clouds, or rippling waves, or ripening corn.

   To the believing ear, the footsteps of the Bountiful Father are
   everywhere audible and the revolving seasons do but reveal the varied
   attributes of God. We may gather from every rustling ear a song, and
   listen in every harvest field to a sermon which angels might stoop to
   hear. It is no unhallowed theme. Come with me to the harvest field--may
   the Master come with us--and let us talk awhile of other things than
   harvests, though the harvest shall be the metaphor on which we will
   fashion our speech.

   A word or two about the gleaning. Under the Jewish dispensation,
   gleaning was one of the rights of the people. The farmer was forbidden
   to reap the corners of the field, and if he should have left a sheaf by
   oversight in the field, he must not go back for it. It was to be left
   for the widow, and the fatherless, and the poor that dwelt in the land.
   No, the rights of gleaning went further than wheat and barley--the
   olive tree was to be beaten but once, and they were to leave the
   gleanings to the poor. So with the vintage. When they gathered the
   grapes they were not utterly to clean the branches of the vines, but
   leave sufficient to give a taste of the delicious fruit to the poorest
   of the land.

   I would not have our Christian farmers less liberal under the Gospel
   dispensation than the farmers were under the Mosaic Law. As Boaz, in
   his generosity gave to Ruth more than she could legally claim, so let
   no possessor of the soil be questioning about the legal rights of the
   poor to gleaning. Let him open his gates sooner than the Jewish farmer
   would have done, and let him sometimes bid his men leave handfuls on
   purpose for the poor. Grieved am I to observe that the custom grows
   with many farmers nowadays to rake their fields and get all they can
   from the poor of the village. And I believe some would rake the stubble
   seven times if they could but get one ear more and leave less for
   gleaning.

   I would not gather into my barn, were I a farmer, a sheaf, every ear of
   which rustled with the cries of the poor. I would not have the poor
   man's curse for all the rich man's field, nor make the poor dwellers in
   the village dissatisfied the whole year round because of a paltry
   handful of corn which I had added to the stock of my bursting barns.
   Especially you who are Christian men, I repeat it in your hearing--be
   not less liberal than was the Jew. And if of old, when there were types
   and shadows, they left good gleanings for the poor, scatter with a
   liberal hand now that we have come to the substance and the fullness of
   the Gospel. Rob not the poor man of his little, but earn his blessing
   by your abundant generosity in the time of reaping your fields.

   I have now to invite you to other fields than these. I would bring you
   to the field of Gospel Truth. My Master is the Boaz. See here, in this
   precious Book is a field full of truthful promises, of blessings rich
   and ripe. The Master stands at the gate and affords us welcome. Strong
   men, full of faith, like reapers, reap their sheaves, and gather in
   their armfuls. Would you were all reapers, for the harvest truly is
   plenteous. But if not reapers, may you be as the maidens of Boaz. I see
   some servants who do not so much reap themselves as partake of that
   which others have reaped. I know we have many in this Church who are
   glad to eat the sweets, and feed upon the fat things of the kingdom,
   when they are brought forth each Sunday in the ministry of the Word.

   But I see trembling yonder, outside the gate, a little company to whom
   I am to address myself today. They are not reapers, they have not
   strength enough of faith to take the bin sheaves. They are not as yet
   like household servants. They are not peaceful enough in their
   consciences to sit down and eat and dip their morsel in the vinegar and
   be satisfied. But they are gleaners, and they are saying, as they stand
   at the gate, "Would that I might find favor in the sight of my Lord,
   that I might even glean in this field, for I should then be content if
   I might gather here and there an ear of Gospel Grace." I am sent to
   you. My Master sends me as one of His young men, and thus He bids me
   say to you, "Come into the field and glean wherever you will, and if in
   the gleaning you should grow strong and become reapers, reap and carry
   home the sheaves for yourselves."

   I. First then, like Boaz, I shall ask the question, "WHO IS THIS
   DAMSEL?" in order that I may find out who these gleaners are who are
   invited into the fields of Christ, that they may glean the handfuls
   that are let fall on purpose for them.

   "Who is this damsel?" The first answer is, she is a Moabitess and a
   stranger. Ah, I know you, poor timid Heart. You say, "I am sprung of an
   evil stock, an heir of wrath even as others. My nature is depraved and
   vile. How can I hope, such an one as I am, that I should ever be
   allowed to go into the Master's field and glean of His good corn of
   Divine Grace? Oh, Sir, if you knew how I feel of my lost and helpless
   state! Could you but perceive how base I am in my own eyes because I
   have been so long a stranger to God, and an alien from the commonwealth
   of Israel, I think you would not invite me to glean in the field at
   all." Verily, my Sister, you are the very person to whom I am sent, for
   it was a Moabite damsel upon whom Boaz set his heart, and it was to her
   that he sent his message, "Abide you fast by my maidens; go not in any
   other field."

   But I ask again, who this damsel is and she answers, "I am not only by
   nature a stranger but I must confess that I am now in my condition
   miserable and poor. I cannot buy Christ's Grace. I can do nothing to
   win His love. Once I thought I had some good works, but now I have
   none. Once I relied upon ceremonies but I have given them up, for I
   find no comfort in them. I am utterly poor--so poor, that I despair of
   ever in the future being richer than I am now. I am helpless. I am
   hopeless. I am nothing. Yes, I am less than nothing. Alas, I am such a
   miserable beggar that I am not worthy of the least of all His mercies."

   Do you say this? Right glad am I, then, to hear you use such language,
   for unto you, again, am I sent, and unto you am I bid to give the
   gracious invitation--"Come into the field and glean even among the
   sheaves."

   Now the gleaner whom I describe is not only in her own experience an
   alien, and a stranger--and in her own present condition naked and poor
   and miserable--but she has, despite all this, a decision for the Lord
   God of Israel. I think I hear her say, "If I perish, I will perish
   looking to the Cross of Christ. I have nothing of my own to bring, but
   I come just as I am. The Lord knows I have no other dependence but upon
   the blood and the finished righteousness of Jesus Christ. I forswear
   the gods of Moab in whom I once trusted. The world is now nothing to
   me. The pomp and vanities thereof have lost all their glory. As to
   myself, I abhor myself in dust and ashes. I would be Christ's, and if
   He will not have me, if I may not glean in His fields, I will never go
   elsewhere--

   'If I perish I wiil pray, And perish only there.'"

   It is marvelous, the tenacity with which some of these timid souls will
   hold to Christ. Just as a man, the more fearful he is of sinking,
   clutches the plank with a more terrible earnestness, so have I seen
   some of these fearful souls lay hold on Jesus with a grip which neither
   death nor Hell could unloose. Were the times of burning to come back
   again, many a wavering soul that can scarcely say, "I know that my
   Redeemer lives," would go singing to the stake! Many of those who are
   bold in words would prove cowardly in acts, and withdraw from Christ
   when it came to burning for Him. Well, it is to you that I am sent,
   poor timid Gleaner. Come in, come into the field, and we will see if we
   cannot let fall some handfuls on purpose for you.

   Our description, however, is far from being complete. This gleaner is
   one who is exceedingly humble and self-emptied. Just observe what she
   says when Boaz takes notice of her--"Who am I, that I should find grace
   in your sight, seeing that I am a stranger?" Ah, and the woman to whom
   I would speak this morning has such a low estimate of herself, that
   when she gets a grain of hope she thinks, "Ah, it is too good for me."
   When, sometimes, you half hope that Christ has loved you, and given
   Himself for you, a sight of your unworthiness comes in and you say,
   "No, this can hardly be, that such an one so mean and so despicable as
   I, should ever be regarded by the lovely eyes of Christ my Lord."

   I know you think yourself not to be pure, or fair, or lovely. And when
   you read such a passage as that, where Christ says of His spouse, "You
   are all fair, My love, there is no spot in you," tears come in your
   eyes, for you say, "Alas, He will never say that of me, for I am all
   defiled with sin, all unholy and unclean. Should He search the world
   through, He would not find a more worthless one than I. And should He
   turn the heap over again and again, he could not find one that less
   deserved to be the object of His pity than I, poor unworthy I."

   Yes, but you are just the person to whom I am sent! Your Lord Jesus has
   heard of you, and He loves such as you are, for when you are little in
   your own eyes, then are you great in His. When you talk thus bashfully
   of yourself, then He loves to hear your words, for they are words of
   truth. In very deed, you are what you say you are, nothing but
   loathsomeness and corruption and depravity. And yet He who has loved
   you, notwithstanding all this, will never leave you till your
   corruption has been removed, till your loathsomeness has been washed
   away, till for deformity you have matchless beauty, and for unholiness
   His perfect righteousness. I say to you, even to you, are we sent
   today.

   Once again, these gleaners have a very high opinion of those who are
   true Christians. You notice Ruth says, "I am not like unto one of the
   handmaidens." No, and my poor gleaner yonder, she thinks the saints of
   God are such a blessed people, she is not like one of them. When she
   gets into her sin experience she says, "If I were a child of God I
   should never be like this." Knowing her vileness and her imperfections
   she cries, "Ah, if I were one of Christ's chosen, I should be much
   holier than I am. Though I love His saints, I cannot dare to hope that
   I shall ever be numbered with them. My goodness can never reach so high
   as to be joined with them in visible fellowship."

   Ah, I know some of you feel that if you ever did get to Heaven you
   would creep through some cranny in the door and hide yourselves in some
   mouse hole far away, where none could see you. And today, though in
   truth you are the best of the saints, you think yourselves the vilest
   of the vile. For many there are that are very rich in Divine Grace who
   think themselves miserably poor. On the other hand, many who say, "I am
   rich and increased in goods and have need of nothing," are naked and
   poor and miserable. Poor Moabitess, long an alien, having gone far into
   sin and now decided for Christ, with a sort of despairing hope that
   maybe He will look upon you. Today, even today, He speaks to you. Open
   your ears and hear Him. Forget your kindred and your father's house,
   for He greatly desires you, and He would have you even now come to Him
   and be espoused unto Him forever.

   I need not prolong our description of the gleaners to whom I speak. The
   Holy Spirit, I hope, will find some of you out and may He press home
   the Truth of God to your hearts.

   II. Having beckoned to the gleaner, I shall now, like Boaz, ADDRESS THE
   REAPERS. The ministers are the reapers, and thus speaks Boaz to
   them--"Let her glean, even among the sheaves, and reproach her not. Let
   fall some of the handfuls on purpose for her, and leave them, that she
   may glean them, and rebuke her not."

   The first command Christ gives to his ministers is--"Rebuke her not."
   Ah, I fear, my Brethren in the ministry, that we have often rebuked
   where we ought to have comforted. And perhaps our unwise speeches, when
   we did not mean to do it, have been very hard blows to the afflicted in
   Zion. It is an ill thing for the strong cattle to push with horn and
   shoulder. We are very apt, unless we have much trial and trouble
   ourselves, to lose the lady's hand which is so necessary for a
   physician of souls. We keep the lion's heart but oh, the tender hand
   and the downy fingers--we are not so ready to keep these in dealing
   with sore consciences.

   I know some preachers who never went to Martin Luther's school. They
   may have prayer and meditation, but they have never been schooled by
   temptation. And if we are not much tempted ourselves, if we are not
   emptied from vessel to vessel ourselves, we are in very great danger
   when we are dealing with these truths--lest we are hard with them and
   rebuke and reproach them, when instead we should hear the Master
   say--"Comfort you, comfort you My people. Speak you comfortably unto
   Jerusalem."

   Now I take it that we do very much reproach these tender ones when we
   set up standards in our ministry to which we tell them they must come
   or else perish. Some do it in experience. I have heard old divines and,
   like Elihu, I have been ready to rebuke my seniors when they have
   taught their experience, in all its length and breadth, as necessary
   for all the people of God. The experience of the advanced saint must
   never be set up as a standard for the young beginner. There are
   mountains for us to climb when our bones are firm, but these mountains
   are not for babes. There are depths into which we are to dive when we
   have learned the art of plunging into them, but these are not for
   little children, who must be dandled on the knee and fondled at the
   breast.

   When we describe some dark passage in our lives, and say to the young
   convert--"You must have felt all this or you are not a child of God,"
   we are reproaching when we ought to have comforted, and rebuking where
   we ought to have consoled. So have I seen a standard of Grace set up.
   Some Christians are eminent in their graces. Their faith is valorous.
   Their courage defies all danger. Their hope is bright and sparkling
   like a diamond. But if in our preaching we tell young converts that
   their graces must be equal in luster to the fathers in the Church, what
   do we do but rebuke Ruth when we ought to have let fall handfuls of
   corn for her to gather?

   And so, too, with regard to doctrinal knowledge. I have known some
   Christians well-schooled in these matters, and deeply read in theology
   who, when they meet with one who knows no more than this--that he is a
   sinner and that Christ came to save sinners--will ask hard, wrinkled
   questions, which are more fit for an assembly of divines than for a
   babe in Christ. And because, indeed, the little child cannot untie a
   Gordian knot, because the babe cannot crack the hard shells of these
   theological nuts, they send him away and say, "The root of the matter
   is not in you. You have not passed from death unto life."

   Oh, let us not do this, dear Brother Reapers. Let us sooner cut
   ourselves with our own sickle than cut Ruth with it! Let us rather be
   patient and very tender and receive the weak in the faith, as Christ
   has received them. Let us, like our Master, not overdrive the Lambs,
   but carry them in our bosom, and gently lead them when they need our
   tenderness and our care.

   There is also another way in which some rebuke these gleaners, who
   should rather be invited and comforted--that is, by denying their faith
   when it is mixed with unbelief! It is marvelous, it is miraculous, that
   a spark of faith can live in the midst of an ocean of unbelief. You
   will find men who, at times, fear that they believe nothing. In their
   own apprehension they are so beclouded and bemisted that they have lost
   their way, and do not know where they are. And yet they are true
   Believers for all that. Some of us have passed through crisis of our
   being in which, if we had been asked our very name, we could hardly
   have told it, for we were so utterly distressed, so lost and cast away
   by reason of overwhelming blasphemies, or incessant temptations, that
   we could scarce tell our right hand from our left.

   And were we therefore without faith? No, there was a little faith,
   still. There was an undying principle still within us when death had
   made us wretched men. So we must not talk to these young beginners as
   though the uprising of their corruption disproved the indwelling of the
   Holy Spirit--we must succor them. We may tell them of the dragons we
   have fought and the giants we have slain, but we must use discretion
   even in this.

   And when they are in the Slough of Despond, we must not leave them to
   sink there up to their very necks but go lend them our hand to pull
   them out, for they may be in the right road even in the slough, and
   they may still have their faces to Zion though those faces may be
   besmeared with the mire and filth of that dreadful bog. Let us never
   rebuke or reproach these timid ones, but help and sustain them.

   But further--Boaz gave another exhortation to the reapers--"Let fall
   handfuls on purpose for her." In our ministry there should always be a
   corner cupboard for the tried and timid saints. I think there should
   never be a sermon without a Benjamin's mess for the children. There
   should be strong meat for the men, but there should always be milk for
   the babes. Ready to adapt our ministry to all sorts of people, if we
   forget any, we should never forget these.

   My Brothers, would you minister to these gleaners? Let me remind you,
   first, that our ministry most be plain, for these timid souls cannot
   feed on hard words. Dr. Manton once preached in St. Paul's Cathedral
   and a great crowd went to listen to him. A poor man who had walked
   fifty miles to hear the good doctor, afterwards plucked him by the
   sleeve and said--"There was nothing for me this morning. The doctor had
   preached a very learned sermon, full of Greek and Latin quotations
   which the poor countryman could not understand. But the doctor had not
   expected him and there was nothing for him.

   I think there should always be in our ministry some things for poor
   Ruth. Something so plain and so simple that the wiseacres will turn up
   their noses and say, "What platitudes!" Never mind, if Ruth gets a
   handful of corn, our Master at the last shall know who did His errand
   best and served Him with a perfect heart. And then, if plain, we must
   remember, too, that it must be very elementary. We must be often laying
   again the foundation stone--teaching faith in Christ again and again.
   As Luther says, we must repeat justification by faith every Sunday,
   because men are so apt to forget it.

   Oh, you fine preachers who elaborate your learned essays, who work all
   the week long to addle your own brains and then spend the Sunday in
   muddling your hearers--would that you would remember these poor
   gleaners, who want none of your fine stuff, none of your glorious
   flights, none of your rounded periods! They are far better off if you
   will tell them that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners,
   and point their eyes to Calvary and bid them look and live. We must let
   fall handfuls on purpose for the weak and ignorant.

   And then again, our preaching must be evangelical. Weeping eyes need
   Christ to dry them. Tender hearts need Jesus' wounds to make them
   whole. A man who lives without temptation may enjoy a Sunday's sermon
   without Christ in it-- but give me a man who is tempted in the week and
   I know he wants Christ! Give me a man who has lost money in the week,
   or that has been subjected to ridicule for Christ's sake, and I know
   that you might as well offer him the husks that swine eat as offer him
   anything but Christ crucified visibly set forth before his eyes.

   Oh, we must get back to this, all of us who are preachers! We must
   forget what we learned at college. We must leave behind what we pick up
   from learned books and come out to tell Ruth just that which she most
   wants to hear--that Boaz welcomes her to the field and bids her glean
   till her hands are full.

   But then, Brethren, you will notice that these reapers were to let
   handfuls fall on purpose for her. Well, then, you reapers in God's
   field, let your preaching be very personal. Oh, I love it, when I draw
   the bow, not to do it at random, but to single out some troubled heart
   and speak to you all as though there were but one here. Not pouring the
   oil over the wound, but coming up to the edge of the gaping sore to
   pour in the oil and wine. These poor Ruths will not dare to take the
   corn unless we put it right in their way. They are so fearful, so
   timorous, that though it seems to be scattered for everybody, they
   think it cannot be for them. But if it is there, put there so that they
   cannot mistake it, then they say-- "Well, that is for me. Yes, that is
   what I have felt. That is what I want." And they cannot, unbelieving
   though they are, they cannot help stooping down and picking up the
   handful that is let fall on purpose for them.

   Then, if it is so, our preaching must always be very affectionate, for
   if we let fall a handful with a scowling face, our Ruth will go to the
   other end of the field rather than pick it up. Oh, Brethren in Christ,
   it is, after all, our sympathy with our fellow men which is the great
   engine the Holy Spirit uses in converting them. It is not merely
   telling out the Truth of God which is the power--God, if He had willed
   it, might have made statues which could preach, and they could have
   preached as well as we do and infinitely better if the Lord had poured
   the words out of their cold lips.

   But he made men preachers, that men might feel for men, and that our
   words might come out from our hearts and so go glowing into the hearts
   of the afflicted. Oh, let us, then, who are reapers for Christ, be very
   tender with poor Ruth! And often when we forget the strong, and leave
   the mighty man to take care of himself, let us go to the gate to pull
   in the fainting Mercy and invite Christiana and her little children to
   sit down and rest. So would I do this morning, and therefore, I pass on
   to our third point.

   III. As myself a reaper for Christ, I must try to follow the example of
   the reapers of Boaz and let fall handfuls on purpose for the gleaner. I
   am afraid I shall not be able to give you such handfuls as I would, but
   they shall come out of the right field. Oh, you timid and troubled
   Heart, let me drop before you now a handful of precious promises. "He
   will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax."

   Does not that suit your case? A reed, helpless, insignificant and weak.
   A bruised reed, out of which no music can come. Weaker than weakness
   itself--a reed--and that reed bruised! He will not break you. He who
   broke Rahab by His right hand will not break you. You are like the
   smoking flax--no light, no warmth comes from you. You are, on the
   contrary, like flax that smokes, giving forth a foul, offensive smell.
   But He will not quench you. He will blow with His sweet breath of mercy
   till He fans you to a flame.

   Do you need another? "Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy
   laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me,
   for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your
   souls." What soft words! Your heart is tender, and the Master knows it.
   Therefore He speaks so gently to you. Will you not listen and obey Him,
   and come to Him, come to Him even now? Hear him again--"Fear not, you
   worm, Jacob, I will help you, says the Lord, and your Redeemer, the
   Holy One of Israel." Or would you hear Jesus Christ speak to you
   again?--"Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe
   also in Me."

   Or, again, "He is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto
   God by Him." Do you not remember ten thousand such passages as these?
   "When you pass through the rivers I will be with you, and the floods
   shall not overflow you. When you go through the fires you shall not be
   burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon you." Or this, "Can a woman
   forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son
   of her womb? Yes, she may forget, yet will I not forget you." Or this,
   "I have blotted out your sins like a cloud, and like a thick cloud your
   transgressions."

   Or this, "Though your sins are as scarlet they shall be as wool. Though
   they are red like crimson they shall be whiter then snow." Or this,
   "The Spirit and the bride say, Come, and let him that is athirst come,
   and whoever will, let him come and take the water of life freely." Or
   this, "Ho, everyone that thirsts, come to the waters and you that have
   no money, come and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk, without money and
   without price." Oh, my Master's field is very rich. Behold the
   handfuls! Look, there they lie before you, poor timid Soul. Gather them
   up, make them your own, for Jesus bids you take them. Be not too
   bashful. But take them, feed on them, and go on in the strength of this
   meat all your days.

   Well, I have dropped a handful of promises. Now let me try and scatter
   a handful of doctrines of Grace. But Ruth starts back, for she is
   afraid to glean in the wheat fields of doctrine. No, but Ruth, here is
   the doctrine of election--come and glean that. Fear not, poor timid
   Soul, it is a sweet and blessed Truth of God. Hear it--"God has chosen
   the weak things of this world and the things that are not has God
   chosen to bring to nothing the things that are." "I thank you, O Father
   of Heaven and earth, that You have hid these things from the wise and
   prudent and have revealed them unto babes."

   Does not that suit you, timid Soul? Are you not as a babe, as a weak
   thing, and as a foolish thing? Oh, there is a handful on purpose for
   you, in the doctrine of electing love. Hear another, the doctrine of
   justification by faith--"not by works of righteousness which we have
   done He saves us, but through Christ Jesus. We are saved through what
   Jesus has done on our behalf." "He that believes on Him is not
   condemned, but has everlasting life." What do you say? Does not that
   suit you? You have no good works--can you not trust Christ and His good
   works on your behalf? Is not this a handful on purpose for you?

   "Yes but I fear," says one, "that if I were saved I should yet fall
   away, for I am so weak." Here is another handful for you--"I give unto
   My sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any
   pluck them out of My hand." "For I am persuaded, that neither death,
   nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
   present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
   creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
   Christ Jesus."

   Is not this a handful on purpose for you? "I have made and I will bear,
   even I will carry, even unto hoar hairs. I am He and unto old age will
   I carry you." What more do you want? I tell you, Ruth, there is not a
   single doctrine in Scripture which, if it is rightly understood, will
   not yield handfuls on purpose for you. Indeed, my Master's Gospel,
   though it is a chariot in which a king may ride, is like an ambulance
   used on the field of battle, in which a man with broken limbs may ride
   comfortably, too. Oh, it is soft riding when Christ carries in His
   arms! And He does this for such as you are. Broken in pieces all
   asunder, with your thoughts like a case of knives cutting your soul,
   and conscience through and through, Christ has made His Gospel to suit
   you.

   The other day, when one of our Brothers was sick of consumption, we
   sent him a waterbed to rest on and the comfort it gave him was indeed
   delightful. But oh, Jesus Christ's bosom is something softer than that!
   Though you are ever so weak, though you are like a sere leaf driven in
   the wind and broken of the tempest, you shall yet find perfect peace
   and quiet in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, for it is a Gospel on
   purpose for you.

   Once more, we have some handfuls to drop that we have gathered in
   another field. We have been to promise field and to doctrine field, now
   let us go to the field of experience. Do you not know, Ruth, that your
   experience is no exception to the rule? There are thousands such as you
   are. And I, too, who speak to you this morning, that you may know the
   truth of this matter, I tell you that once upon a time I stood like
   yourself shivering at the gate. And I said in my soul, "His mercy is
   clean gone forever. He will be mindful of His Covenant no more."

   For years I cried for mercy but did not find it. I wrote my name among
   the damned and said I must perish, for God had shut up the heart of His
   compassion. But He has never despised the cry of His prisoner. I looked
   unto Him and was lightened and I am not ashamed to confess that there
   is light nowhere but in Him. "Oh," you say, "then your experience is
   something like mine!" Just so, it is. And so there is a handful on
   purpose for you. I know the devil tells you, you are lost in a road
   where Christ's mercy never travels. But it is a mistake. You are in the
   midst of the King's highway. I know Satan tells you that you have come
   to the ends of the earth. But my Lord puts it--"Look unto Me and be you
   saved, all you ends of the earth."

   Oh, but you think you are the last man! Ah, but Christ loves to take
   the last and make them first, while the first he often leaves to be
   last. Yes, but you have written bitter things against yourself! Never
   mind what you have written. What a mercy it is Christ did not write
   them, and that, on the contrary, He has written sweet things of you!
   And he has said, "Return unto Me, says the Lord, for I am reconciled
   unto you." Soul, my Master--would that He were here to speak for
   Himself--for my poor words are so feeble compared with His--my Master
   woos you this morning.

   Instead of offering you a gleaning, He offers you Himself. You came to
   be a gleaner. He would make you His spouse. See, Boaz comes to you.
   Will you have Him? The ring is in His hand. Come, stretch out the
   finger of your little faith and let the deed be done. Say, "Unworthy
   though I am, I hope, my Lord, I am Yours. No other would I have to
   serve, to love, to trust. Jesus, just as I am, take me and make me what
   You would have me to be." It is done. The marriage is ratified, and
   by-and-by, it shall be consummated before the eternal throne in your
   everlasting bliss.

   I have good reason for being earnest in trying to comfort this Ruth,
   because, though she is a stranger, she is a sister of mine. I am a
   stranger, too. We both come from the same land, and the same howling
   wilderness. She is in trouble and my soul has known trouble, too--the
   same trouble-and I would desire to bring her to the port of Peace.
   Besides, she is to be my Master's wife, and I would be on good terms
   with the mistress of the house. It is ill for the reaper to have an
   enemy in the mistress. And since I know that this Ruth shall by-and-by
   find Boaz to be her next of kin, I would desire do her a good service
   and bring her to her Master's house, if so my Lord would honor me.

   IV. I close my sermon of this morning, by stirring up timid and
   troubled ones to do what I know Divine Grace will make them do before
   long. I say, then, to you who are thus troubled in your consciences,
   since the field is open to you, and we bid you glean--since Boaz
   himself commands us to let fall handfuls on purpose for you--do your
   duty and be bold to believe today. You have been afraid to trust Christ
   up to now--trust Him now. Venture on Him. It is a poor word to use, but
   do it. Though something tells you you have no right to trust Christ, do
   it, right or not right, NOW, flat on your face before Him, with no
   confidence but in what He has done and in what He is doing still.

   Be bold to believe in Him at this moment and you shall live. And having
   believed in Him, be industrious every time the Word is preached to pick
   up every ear of comfort in the sermon. Ruth must bend her back, though
   it is but one ear at a time she gathers. Think it worth while to hear a
   sermon in ever such a crowd, if you may get but one ear of comfort--
   for one ear is a great thing for one who deserves none. And but one
   word of mercy from the lips of Christ should be accounted more precious
   than rubies to a soul that deserves to hear Him say, "Depart you
   cursed." And when you have gathered one grain and another, seek a
   retentive memory to keep in your hand what you have gathered, or else
   you will be like a silly gleaner who stoops to glean one ear and drops
   another at the same time.

   Carry home what of truth you can. Take notes in your heart. And when
   you have gathered, and your hands are full, take care to discriminate.
   Ruth, we are told, threshed her corn and left the straw behind--she
   took home the good wheat. You do the same. There is much straw in all
   our sermons, much that our Master would not have us say--for we are
   poor, poor creatures, and but fallible like yourselves. But leave the
   straw behind and take home the good wheat. And do us this service--do
   not take home the straw, and leave the wheat, as some do. There are
   many foolish gleaners who, if there is one word of ours awry, will tell
   it to our discredit--but our Master's words they will forget.

   And, lastly, while you are on your knees in prayer, beating out the
   sermon in meditation, turn your eye to my Master. Go to Him and say to
   Him, "Lord, I am content to glean, though I get but one ear of mercy.
   But oh, that I had You! Oh, that You would give me Yourself! I have no
   beauty, but oh, You do not love us for our beauty but for Your beauty
   which You cast on us. Lord, look on me! All I can say is that if You
   will save me, I will praise You on earth, and I'll praise You in
   Heaven. There shall not be one before the Throne more grateful than I,
   because there shall be none who shall owe so much to Your unmerited,
   rich, free, Sovereign Grace."

   Sinner, if you do that now, my Master will accept you. Trust Him NOW,
   poor Hearts, trust Him now! Away, you devil of Hell, away, away! Why
   will you molest these lambs? Timid and troubled consciences, hear not
   what your doubts and fears and Hell and the devil would say--come now
   to my Master! His wounds invite you--His tearful eyes invite you--His
   open heart bids you come. Come and trust Him, He cannot reject you if
   you trust Him just as you are!

   God help you to do it and you shall see sin forgiven, your foes
   trampled under your feet, and you yourselves shall meet the great Boaz
   at the marriage supper and to Him shall be the glory forever and ever.
   Amen.

                       The Holy Spirit Glorifying Christ

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 17, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "He shall glorify Me: for He shall take of Mine, and shall show it unto
   you."

   John 16:14.

   WE always need the Spirit of God in our preaching. But I think we more
   especially require His Divine direction and instruction when the
   subject is Himself--for the Holy Spirit is so mysterious in His varied
   attributes and operations, that unless He Himself shall reveal Himself
   to us and give us the words in which to speak of Him, we shall surely
   fail either to understand for ourselves, or to enlighten others. In His
   light we see light, but without Him we grope like blind men in the
   dark.

   Certain sins against the Holy Spirit continually exist in a degree in
   the Christian Church. Unholiness of life grieves the Holy Spirit. When
   Christian men walk not according to the Gospel. When their conversation
   is not ordered according to the pattern of Christ, then the Holy
   Spirit, who has no fellowship with unholiness, withdraws Himself in a
   measure from the Church. Discord, too, strife among Brethren,
   forgetfulness of the new commandment, that we love one another, grieves
   the sacred Dove--for as His nature is peaceable, as His office is to be
   the peace giver--so He tarries not where there is the din and noise of
   contending parties.

   So, also, when He perceives His saints to be diseased with worldliness,
   when we prefer the treasures of Egypt to the reproach of Christ, and
   seek rather the things which are seen, which are temporal, than the
   things which are not seen, which are eternal--then again is the Holy
   Spirit quenched and departs from our midst. Above all, pride and that
   murmuring, rebellion, unbelief, obstinacy and self-seeking which pride
   leads to--all this grieves the Holy Spirit, for He dwells with those
   who are humble and of a contrite spirit. Where there is the voice of
   murmuring, where one man seeks to lift himself above another, and all
   to exalt themselves above their despised Lord, the Holy Spirit hides
   Himself and suffers barrenness to take the place of plenty, and death
   to reign where once life triumphed.

   These are a few of the common and the constant infirmities of the
   Church, by which the Holy Spirit is much hindered in those marvelous
   manifestations which otherwise would be common and usual in the midst
   of our Israel.

   But there are two faults of the Church which appear to me periodically
   to manifest themselves. The one is when men ascribe wrong things to the
   Holy Spirit, and make Him the Author of human novelties and delusions.
   In seasons when the minds of good men were anxiously alive to spiritual
   operations, certain weak-headed or designing persons have grown
   fanatical. Bewildered by their own confused feelings and puffed up by
   their fleshly minds, they have forsaken the true light which is in the
   Word, to follow after the will-o'-the-wisps of their own fancies, the
   absurdities of their own brains. Such vainglorious fools aspiring to be
   leaders, masters of sects, will boldly tell men of itching ears that
   fresh doctrines have been especially revealed to them.

   They prate much of what they call the inner light (which is often an
   inner darkness), which dim candle they exalt above the light of the
   Word of God, and tell you that marvelous things have been taught to
   them in dreams and visions. Ah, this is a high and crying crime. What?
   Will you lay at the door of the Holy Spirit a deed which God has
   solemnly cursed? Do you not start back at such a thought? Is it not
   almost blasphemy to imagine it? And yet remember, he that adds a single
   word to the canon of inspiration is cursed. Give ear to the very words
   of the Lord our God, "If any man shall add unto these things, God shall
   add unto him the plagues that are written in this Book. And if any man
   shall take away from the Words of the Book of this prophecy, God shall
   take away his part out of the Book of Life and out of the holy city and
   from the things which are written in this Book."

   And do you think the Holy Spirit would do that which involves a curse
   upon man? If I venture to add to God's Word, or to take from it, I do
   it with this as my penalty--that God shall blot my name out of the Book
   of Life and out of the holy city. And yet these base pretenders, who
   would lay their foolish notions at the door of God the Holy Spirit,
   will have it that He has taught them more than is in the Book, that He
   has removed that which God laid down as the grand landmark and added to
   the finished testimony of God. Let none of you have any sort of
   patience with men who talk thus.

   Deny their very first principle. Tell them--whether it is the deceiver
   of Western America, or the false prophet of Arabia--tell them that they
   are all impostors, for they ascribe to the Holy Spirit that which is
   impossible for Him to commit--a violation of the revealed will of God
   in which it is declared that the canon of inspiration is shut up once
   and for all. A little of this evil I detect among godly people. I find
   that sometimes even gracious men think they have had revelations. Texts
   of Scripture are no doubt laid home by the Holy Spirit to the souls of
   men as much today as in Paul's time, and there can be no doubt whatever
   that the Spirit brings all things Christ has taught to our remembrance,
   and that He leads us into all Truth.

   But when a man tells me that the Holy Spirit has revealed to him
   something that is not in the Bible, he lies! Is that a hard word? It
   does but express the Truth of God. The man may have dreamed his
   revelation, he may have fancied it--but the Holy Spirit goes never
   beyond the written Word. "He shall take of Mine and shall show it unto
   you." And beyond what Christ has spoken and what Christ has taught, the
   Holy Spirit goes in no sense and in no respect. You understand what
   Christ has taught through the Spirit's teaching. But anything beyond
   the teaching of Christ and His Apostles must be not of God but of man.

   This is a most important principle to be held fast by all godly people,
   for the day may come when false prophets shall arise and delude the
   people, and by this shall we be able to discover them. If they claim
   anything beyond what Christ has taught, put them aside, for they are
   false prophets, wolves in sheep's clothing. The Spirit only teaches us
   that which Christ has taught beforehand either by Himself or by the
   inspired Apostles. "He shall take of Mine and shall show it unto you."

   Just now we are in little danger from the excesses of fevered brains,
   for, as a rule, our sin is in being far too cold and dead to spiritual
   influences. I fear we are liable to another evil and are apt to forget
   the Person and work of the Comforter altogether. We fear some
   congregations might say, "We have not so much as heard whether there is
   any Holy Spirit." From how many modern sermons would you even know that
   there was a Holy Spirit? If it were not for the benediction, or the
   doxology, you might go in and out of many Churches and meeting houses
   in a year and scarcely know that there was such a Person as that
   blessed, blessed Giver of all good, the Holy Spirit.

   Sometimes we hear a little about His influences, as if the Holy Spirit
   were not as truly a Person as even Jesus Christ Himself, who in flesh
   and blood trod this earth. Oh, dear Friends, I fear the first
   danger--that of running wild with whimsies and fancies about inner
   lights and new revelations. But I equally dread this last, this putting
   the Revelation above the Revealer, this taking the Book without the
   Author, this preaching of the Truth of God without the great Truth
   Applier--this going forth to work with the Sword, forgetting that it is
   the Sword of the Spirit and only as mighty as the Holy Spirit makes it
   "mighty to the pulling down of strongholds."

   May this Church ever continue to reverence the Holy Spirit without
   exaggerating His work! May we prize Him, love Him, and adore Him
   because He so wondrously glorifies our blessed Lord! With this, by way
   of preface, I shall now come at once to our text, using it three
   ways--first, as a test to try various things by. Secondly, as a
   direction how to honor Jesus. And thirdly, as a stimulus, stirring us
   up to glorify Christ.

   I. First, then, we shall use our text AS A TEST. There are a thousand
   things that claim to be of the Holy Spirit. How can we know whether
   they are or not? Here is a simple mode of discovering, "He shall
   glorify Me."

   1. Let us, first of all, apply this test to ministers. There are crowds
   of preachers and reverend divines nowadays in the world. But all are
   not ministers of God. A true minister is a creation of the God of
   Heaven. It is no more in the power of the Church than it is in the
   power of the bishops to make ministers. Independency is as weak as
   Episcopacy on this point. God, alone, ordains ministers. All that the
   Church can do is to recognize them. We cannot make them at our
   colleges. We cannot make them by the laying on of hands, nor even by
   the choice of the Church. God must make them--God must ordain them. It
   is only for the Church to perceive God's work, and cheerfully to submit
   to His choice.

   And, there are some churches which clearly are not of the Holy Spirit,
   because they glorify ceremonies. We could take you into certain places
   of worship where the general strain of ministry is a glorification of
   Baptism, the blessed Eucharist, confirmation, priesthood, and so on.
   There you hear much of the childish millinery with which they deck the
   altar, and much is said of those grotesque garments in which their
   priests disguise themselves. We could point to many places where the
   main object of teaching seems to be to exalt a rubric, to magnify a
   liturgy, to hold up a hierarchy, or to extol a ritual. All such
   churches we may at once sweepingly and unerringly condemn. They are not
   of the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit teaches us not to magnify
   outward rites, but Christ. And that teaching is not of the Holy Spirit
   which does not glorify the Lord Jesus.

   Into other places we might take you where very clearly the object is
   the extolling of doctrine. From the first of January to the last of
   December the minister bitterly contends for the favorite corners of his
   faith. Doctrine, with certain friends, is everything, and their rigid
   orthodoxy is the one care of their life. Now, against a sound creed and
   the Doctrines of Grace we have not a word to say. God be thanked that
   we love these things as much as those who exalt them above measure. We
   are not a whit behind the chief of these champions in our zeal for
   orthodoxy.

   But still our Lord is, and must be, the leading theme of our ministry.
   We must continue to exalt Him rather than Calvinism, or any other
   system of theology. We are bold to say it, much as we love the Master's
   Throne, we still love the Master better. And dearly as we love battling
   for the walls of His vineyard, yet the clusters of His Eshcol are
   sweeter to our taste. We love Christ better than creed, and we think we
   would rather magnify our Master than any set of truths, however
   important they may be.

   There are certain doctrinal Brethren, good enough in their way, but
   still you can evidently see that the doctrine of election is a thing
   that they contend more for than the doctrine of the redemption of
   Christ. Or if it is redemption, it is the specialty of redemption
   rather than the Divine sacrifice itself. I love to preach the
   distinguishing Grace of God, but I am far from thinking that some four
   or five points comprise all the truths which God has revealed. Be it
   ours to preach the doctrines as Dr. Hawker preached them--with Christ
   as their sum and substance. "A full Christ for empty sin-ners"--may
   this be our theme. To a great extent it is true of a church that seeks
   only to exalt doctrines, that it has not the fullness of the Holy
   Spirit in it, for of the Holy Spirit it is written, "He shall glorify
   Me."

   Another class of ministers are well known to those of us who have
   looked upon the Church of God at large, whose ministry tends mainly to
   magnify a certain experience. If you have felt thus and thus, and so
   and so, no words of praise can be too strong for you. But if you have
   been led in another way, in a different path, then depend on it,
   according to the judgment of these divines, you never knew vital
   godliness at all. They are as intimate with the secrets of Heaven as
   the pope himself, and are quite as infallible as he, in their small
   dominions. Some of these Brethren have, no doubt, gone through a very
   deep and awful experience--they have lived so much in sin, and have
   been so untrue to their Lord, that it is little marvel if they have to
   walk in darkness and see no light. These Brethren hold up that
   experience as a model and tell us that unless we know all they have
   learned, we are not Christ's.

   Now, I say not a word against experimental preaching. I believe it to
   be the most soul-fattening preaching in the world--but it must be
   experience about Christ, it must be an experience that leads me out of
   self to Jesus--and if any ministry is experimental, yet does not exalt
   Christ, I have cause to suspect whether the Holy Spirit is with it, for
   this stands as an unchanging rule--"He shall glorify Me."

   And, dear Brothers and Sisters, once again, we are cursed with some few
   men--would to God they were fewer-- whose teaching constantly is,
   "morality." If we will do this, and do that and the other, we shall be
   saved--the old Law of Moses is toned down and then held up as the road
   to Heaven. Now, at once, you may forsake the synagogues where such men
   are in the chief places. If any man exalt the works of flesh, and not
   the finished work of Christ--if the doings, the willings, the prayers,
   the feelings of man, are put in the place of the blood and
   righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ-- that church is not of the Holy
   Spirit.

   And what might I say of many who produce each Sunday their pretty
   little essays, their elaborate disquisitions, their high-sounding
   periods? What shall I say of all these, but that they are as "sounding
   brass and a tinkling cymbal," inasmuch as they forget Christ, the
   Person of Christ--God and man, the work of Christ--His Atonement and
   righteousness? The resurrection of Christ--the gift and joy of the
   saints, the intercession of Christ--our hope and our strength, and the
   second advent of Christ, which is as the bright morning star to every
   weary watcher in this world's darkness? That Church, and that Church
   only, is of the Holy Spirit which magnifies Christ Jesus.

   And here, dear Brethren in the ministry--and there are some such
   present--how bitterly may you and I lament much of our ministry because
   it has not glorified Christ! When we shall lie stretched upon our dying
   beds, we shall look back with satisfaction to that poor stammering
   sermon in which we magnified the Master. We shall look with intense
   regret to that well-delivered oration in which we glorified a sect, or
   lifted up an ordinance at the expense of our Lord. Oh, what joy it
   shall be to remember that we did lift Him up, however feebly, yet we
   did extol Him. Though sometimes utterance would not come as our heart
   would have it, yet we did point to His flowing wounds and said, "Behold
   the way to God."

   Oh, the sweet bliss of a Whitfield when he retires to his last couch,
   to feel that he did preach Jesus, whether it was at the market, or on
   the hill side, or in the Church, or in the barn! What a consolation to
   feel that he did cry faithfully, "Other foundation can no man lay than
   that which is laid!" Oh, the curse on the other hand, that shall rest
   on a man who, in his last moments, shall have to reflect--"I preached
   other men's sermons and talked of anything but Christ. I lifted up
   anything but the Lord"! Oh, how shall the howling of his eternal doom
   commence in his ear! How shall the judgments of God get hold upon him
   even before he passes to the dread tribunal of the Most High. We must,
   as preachers, come back more and more to this rule--to feel that if the
   Holy Spirit is in us, He will make us glorify Christ.

   2. Having thus tried ministers, let us now take the same test with
   regard to doctrine. And very briefly here, lay it down as a
   self-evident truth that any teaching, whatever authority it may claim,
   which does not glorify Christ, is most assuredly false. And on the
   other hand, I think we shall seldom be wrong if we believe that when a
   teaching lifts Christ up and puts many crowns upon His head, it must be
   a doctrine according to godliness.

   Dear Friends, Socinianism must be utterly abhorred of us, for it
   strikes at once at the Deity of our blessed Lord and Master. We cannot
   give to such persons even the name of Christians. Mohammedan they may
   be--it were well if they would join with those men--they may be good
   men, they may be moral men, they may be excellent citizens, but
   Christians they cannot be, if they deny our Lord to be very God of very
   God and worthy to be worshipped even as is the Father.

   I marvel that sundry Dissenters should have fraternized with Arians and
   Socinians in attacking the Church of England, in the present
   sorrowfully mistaken onslaught called the Bicentenary. And I can only
   pray that the Lord may not visit them for this shameful confederacy
   with His enemies. In Arminianism, which is a mixture of truth and
   error, there is the doctrine of the saints falling from Divine Grace.
   This is a doctrine which is more dishonorable to Christ than I can tell
   you. To my mind, it seems to put its black and sooty finger right down
   the escutcheon of my Lord and Master, setting Him as a laughingstock to
   the whole world. It says He is One who begins to build and is not able
   to finish--there is a blot upon His power.

   He loves, and yet He loves not to the end--there is a blot upon His
   faithfulness. He says, "I give unto My sheep eternal life and they
   shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My hand." And
   yet, according to the Arminian, they do perish--according to that
   doctrine which is a stain upon His truthfulness. In fact, the doctrine
   of final falling away impugns the whole Character of Christ so much
   that it would render Him unworthy of our faith. When they shall prove
   that one who was once in Christ has fallen away and has been lost, I
   know not Christ, for He has violated His Word. He can no more be "the
   Truth," when He has thus put His own promises into the background and
   suffered His darlings to fall into the power of the dog.

   If there is anything in Scripture as plain as noonday, it is the
   doctrine that, "He that believes in Him has everlasting life, and shall
   never perish, neither shall he come into condemnation." If the child of
   God can be disinherited, if Christ can divorce His spouse, if the Good
   Shepherd shall lose His sheep, if the limbs of Christ's mystical body
   can be cut off, or can be allowed to rot, then I know not what
   Scripture teaches, nor do I understand how Christ can be worthy of the
   Believer's trust. That doctrine, I think, must be reprobated, because
   it stains the honor and glory of Christ.

   Without alluding to others, let that suffice as an instance. Examine
   well all doctrines. Look not at them with complacency because they are
   put in cunning language, or asserted in vigorous declamation. But if
   you perceive that any teaching dishonors Christ and makes much of human
   ability--if it exalts man and derogates from the Grace of God--it is
   false and dangerous. And if, on the other hand, it lays man in the dust
   and lifts up Christ as a Savior, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and
   the End of salvation, you may safely say that is the Holy Spirit's
   doctrine, for He shall glorify Christ.

   3. Again, we may use our text as a means by which to try much of the
   conviction through which a sinner passes. In the first dawn of our
   spiritual life a mighty tempest of spiritual influence sweeps over the
   heart. The Holy Spirit is active, and the prince of the power of the
   air is active, too. There is more of God and more of Satan in a new
   convert, than perhaps in any other stage of human existence. For just
   then Satan rages with extraordinary fury to drag back the soul to
   destruction, and the Holy Spirit works in him mightily, with a power
   which only Omnipotence can wield.

   How, in this confusion, can a man know what part of his conviction is
   of God, and what part of the devil? Young man, listen to me. You have a
   thought in your head that you are too great a sinner to be saved. That
   is not of the Holy Spirit, clearly, because it detracts from the power
   of Christ as a Savior. That cannot be of the Holy Spirit, for the Holy
   Spirit glorifies Christ. "Yes, Sir, but I feel myself to be a great
   sinner, utterly lost and ruined." That is of the Holy Spirit, because
   it lays you low in order that the greatness of Christ's salvation may
   be the more apparent.

   "Oh but," you say, "I am not fit to come to Christ." Surely this
   feeling is not of the Holy Spirit, but of the devil, for it does not
   glorify Christ. What? Are you to make yourselffit to come to Christ?
   Why, that is making you a Christ--yes, it is making you an antichrist,
   which is no work of Heaven but a foul design of Hell. "But I heard old
   Mr. So-and-So say the other day, Sir, that when he was converted, he
   seemed to be dragged by the hair of his head to the very depths of
   Hell. He said his soul was full of blasphemy and his heart was in such
   an awful state that he cursed the day of his birth, because he thought
   he was shut out of the Covenant and was utterly lost beyond the reach
   of mercy."

   Very well, no doubt what he has told you was his veritable experience.
   But do you want to experience every piece of devilry that a good man
   has known? Because a good man trips and falls into the gutter, must you
   trip and fall there, too? Because Jonah descends into the whale's
   belly, must we all dive into the sea? I tell you, Soul, that much of
   what your friend felt was not of God, but of his own corrupt heart and
   of the devil--and he knows it, and he will confess the same to you.
   Why, therefore, should you pant after that which is sinful and Satanic?
   Why should you desire to drink the poison of asps and sniff the fumes
   of Tophet?

   If the Lord brings you, this morning, to put your soul just as it is
   into the hands of the Redeemer, honoring Him by a childlike trust, you
   have an experience infinitely more precious than the howling of devils,
   and the ravings of your proud heart could ever yield you. To be
   nothing, and to accept Christ as everything, is worked in us of the
   Holy Spirit-- all the rest, those horrible insinuations, that terrible
   Hell-shaking--may be all dispensed with. Good men have felt these, but
   they are not good things. They come from Satan and are to be avoided
   and prayed against--not to be sought after.

   I pray you, therefore, let the Holy Spirit lead you in His own way and
   ask not to be led in a way of your own choice. Why long for darkness
   when the Master wills to let you walk in the light? Into these
   balances, then, put all your convictions, and discover how far they are
   of God and how far of Satan. That which glorifies Christ is of the Holy
   Spirit. All the rest is of flesh, or of Hell.

   4. Thus, we may test what is called experience. Very much of the
   experience of a Christian is not Christian experience. If any person
   should mount the platform and say, "I will tell you the experience of a
   man," and then inform us that he had been five times tried at the Old
   Bailey, you would say, "Well, you may have experienced that disgrace
   but it is not fair to call it human experience."

   So, a Christian man may fall into great darkness and into sin, too. Let
   us mournfully confess it. But then, if he shall set up his darkness and
   his sin as being Christian experience, we say, "No. We do not judge
   you, you may be a Christian and know all this, but we cannot allow you
   to judge us and decide our spiritual state according to your peculiar
   method of feeling. I fear that many biographies have done as much
   mischief as service. While no doubt they comfort many who fall into the
   same state, yet a sufficient discrimination is not made between the man
   stirred by the powers of evil, and the same man when filled with the
   Holy Spirit.

   When we get to that which comes from beneath we ought to write always
   in the spirit of our Apostle who cannot describe himself without an
   agony--"Oh, wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body
   of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ my Lord." That which
   glorifies Christ is true Christian experience, and that which does
   anything but this, a Christian may experience--but it is not Christian
   experience.

   5. Let us lift the scales of judgment once more. I think our text gives
   us an excellent test by which to try ourselves. My Hearer, are you
   saved or not, this morning? If you are saved, the bent, the tenor, the
   bias of your life is to glorify Christ. What do you say in looking
   back? Does the past glorify! "When I think of the love that cleansed me
   from such sin, of the Divine Grace that broke a heart so hard as mine,
   of the faithfulness that has kept me to this day, I can only glorify
   Christ." And what about the present? "Oh," can you say, "when I think
   of what I now am by the Grace of God and what I should have been now if
   the Holy Spirit had not prevented. When I look within and see so much
   blackness, I must mag- nify the Grace that keeps me. And when It look
   without and see so many temptations, I must and will speak well of His
   dear name. I must glorify my Lord Jesus"?

   And what do you say about the future? Will you glorify Him then? I
   think I see even the timid ones with their eyes, a little brightening
   up when they say, "Yes! If He will but once bring me across the river,
   if I ever get beyond gunshot of the devil, and behold the face of
   Christ in Glory, I will sing loudest of all the crowd. I will magnify
   Him with all my powers, for I shall owe more to Him than anyone else
   before the Throne. I will never cease to sing with all the blood-washed
   throng, 'Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown him Lord of all.' "

   Oh, if your heart is not so that Christ is ALL to you, and if your soul
   is not desiring this morning to honor Him, Him only, then indeed, I
   fear the Holy Spirit has had no dealing with your spirit, for where He
   has been at work, He must, He shall glorify Christ.

   II. We are now to use our text as DIRECTION. How are we to glorify
   Christ?

   The text tells us that we must have the Holy Spirit. Let our text,
   then, be sanctified to our humiliation. Here are we saved by the rich
   love of Christ, delivered from our sins, and made alive unto God. And
   yet we are such weak things that we cannot glorify Christ without the
   indwelling of the Holy Spirit. We may pant, and long, and pray that we
   may have helped to honor our Master, but we shall only dishonor Him and
   disgrace His cause, unless the Holy Spirit holds us up and strengthen
   us. Do you hear that, Christian Man and Woman? You have ten talents but
   those ten talents shall make you ten times a worse defaulter to your
   Master unless the Holy Spirit helps you.

   You have eloquence, you have wit, you have wealth--with none of these
   can you glorify Christ, unless the Holy Spirit is with you. For, "He
   shall glorify Me." Man cannot, except as the Holy Spirit is with him.
   Bow your heads, then, O you saints of God, and ascribe glory unto the
   Holy Spirit, but unto yourselves shame and confusion of face. Let us
   employ this text as an excitement to earnest prayer. We as a Church,
   and I may speak freely for my own flock, we long to see Christ
   glorified. It is to this end we seek to train up our sons, young men in
   our much-loved college, that they may go forth as preachers of the
   Word.

   We have agencies by which we hope to do something in our generation for
   our Master--but what is everything we can do without the Holy Spirit?
   Let us, therefore, pray without ceasing. Oh, without prayer, what are
   the Church's agencies but the stretching out of a dead man's arm, or
   the lifting up of the lid of a blind man's eye? Only when the Holy
   Spirit comes is there any life and force and power. Cry then mightily
   unto God, O you who seek to glorify Christ, for without the Holy Spirit
   you utterly fail.

   And here what a lesson our text reads us of entire dependence upon the
   Holy Spirit. You can do nothing, you ministers of God! Nothing, you
   faithful watchmen of Jerusalem! You can do nothing, you teachers of
   youth, nothing you heralds of the Cross in foreign fields, nothing you
   ten thousands who are willing to give all your substance, your time and
   your talents--absolutely nothing can you accomplish until God the Holy
   Spirit comes.

   We are by the seaside. There are a number of ships left high and dry by
   the ebb of the tide. A long tract of mud stretches out before us. What
   is to be done? Call the king's horses, bring the king's men, gather
   together the wise and the mighty. What can they all do? Nothing--their
   learning can only avail to prove most clearly that they can do nothing.
   But see, the tide rolls in, wave after wave rises from the deep, and
   lo, every ship floats and all the mud and sand is covered with the
   fullness of the sea. So is it with the Churches. We all lie high and
   dry upon the beach and there is nothing but the rock and mud of our own
   inability that is visible--and we can do nothing, absolutely nothing,
   till the holy tide comes.

   The blessed spirit of revival, the Holy Spirit, is poured out, and now
   the heaviest Church is floating out to sea and that which was most
   inactive begins to move! Oh, what can we not do if we have the Holy
   Spirit? What can we do if we have Him not? See our utter and entire
   dependence upon Him. When we, as a Church, first came out into broader
   light and more public notice, I bear my witness, we had an entire
   dependence upon the Holy Spirit. What prayers have I heard, what
   striving and what groaning! We are reaping now the ripe fruits of the
   early sowing.

   Lo, your minister but a stripling from the country--all untrained in
   academic lore, knowing nothing but just the doctrine of the Cross--came
   forth before the multitudes to proclaim simply the Word. How he felt
   his nothingness then, and how often he told you so! You cried to God,
   and the child, the lad, was helped. What mighty deeds were done in the
   conversion of hundreds! And now we have a name, and there is a great
   temptation to rest upon our success, and for men to think there is
   something in the preacher, that he can gather the crowd, can preach the
   Word, and it is sure to be blessed when he preaches it.

   Brothers and Sisters, again I say we are nothing, we are less than
   nothing. Your minister is a fool, and nothing beyond. Unless the Holy
   Spirit is with him, he is able to do nothing except mischief. Nothing
   that shall be profitable to you, or make any heart glad but the heart
   of the Evil One, unless the Holy Spirit is with us still. Joyously
   would I receive again the jeer, the sneer, the constant slander that
   was heaped upon my devoted head, if I might have back again your entire
   dependence upon the Holy Spirit.

   Oh, members of this Church, you who have been quickened under our word,
   let not your faith stand in the wisdom of man, but in the demonstration
   of the Spirit! And let us one and all feel that we are still as weak as
   water, and as vain as the whistling wind, unless He that was first with
   us is with us still. "He shall glorify Me." The Holy Spirit shall do
   it. None can do it if He is absent.

   I know I am addressing some this morning who have seen the goings forth
   of the Holy One of Israel. In fact we as a Church have had to rejoice
   these nearly nine years in a blessed revival. But how diligent should
   we be while we have that revival, in order that we may retain it! All
   the farmers in England cannot make it leave off raining but when it
   does leave off and the sun shines, I know what they do--get their wheat
   in as quickly as they can. All the sailors on the ocean cannot make a
   capful of wind. When the sail flaps to and fro they cannot make it
   swell out as in the gale--but what can they do when the wind does blow?
   They can crowd on every yard of canvas.

   So all the Christians in the world cannot make the Holy Spirit work.
   "The wind blows where it lists, and you hear the sound thereof, but can
   not tell from where it comes nor where it goes." But what we can do is
   this, when we have the Holy Spirit--we can use Him. When He is with us
   we can work. We must make hay while the sun shines. We must grind while
   the wind blows, we must be active and diligent for God when the
   visitation of the Holy Spirit is with us. The revival has, to a great
   extent, ceased in many places. I fear it is because they did not
   diligently use its influence.

   In Ireland how much of revival there was but the Holy Spirit withdrew
   necessarily because it was held up as a curiosity. Every newspaper
   reeked with the news of the revival. People went from England to see
   it. It could not last, then. God never does His great works to be
   stared at, to be held up as curiosities. The thing was ruined the
   moment men began curiously to talk of it, and spread abroad the news as
   of a phenomenon worthy of philosophical investigation.

   These good things should never be made a subject of. "Come, see my zeal
   for the Lord of Hosts." While the good work goes on we should be so
   hard at work for the Master, that we have not time to put into every
   penny newspaper the tale of what God is doing. Let us then be up while
   the Master is with us, and doing His work, doing it in the Spirit's own
   way, seeking to glorify Jesus, and seeking to retain the Spirit in our
   midst.

   III. And now, lastly, I am to take my text by way of A STIMULUS. Does
   the Holy Spirit glorify Christ? Ah, then, how should we aim to do it!
   Let us make, then, Beloved Brothers and Sisters in Christ, let us make
   this the one object of our life--to glorify Christ. You have been a man
   in a large way of business. Could you say while you were doing business
   so largely that your object was to honor Christ in it?

   Well, you have come down in the world. You have a smaller shop now.
   Yes, and suppose you can glorify God more? Then you are in a better
   position than you used to be. I have seen many a man who prospered in
   his soul and honored his Master much, who has made a wrong step and has
   injured his usefulness and happiness. Wanting to get more business, he
   has launched into wide speculations and has had less time for serving
   his Lord. And he has thus really been in a worse position, for
   spirituals were under a decay.

   You may have seen in the newspapers an instance of what sometimes comes
   through getting wealthy. A man and his wife were prospering in a little
   way of business, as hard-working people, near Birmingham. A friend died
   and left the wife some 1,300, no great sum but quite enough to ruin a
   man. They at once took a public house and you will remember that he now
   lies in prison on a charge of murdering his wife. Little marvel that
   when, tempted by what little they had, to seek after more they entered
   upon an ill occupation in order to increase their wealth. That evil
   trade soon led to vicious habits and to death.

   Now I have seen Believers mournfully impoverish their souls by seeking
   after carnal wealth instead of seeking Christ. But let a man's only
   object be to glorify Christ, and he will feel very little concern where
   Providence places him, so long as he may still promote his one object
   and put crowns on the Redeemer's head.

   This brings me to say, Brethren, while we make this our aim, let us
   take every opportunity of glorifying Christ. We throw thousands of
   opportunities away. Where we might do good, we neglect it. I chide my
   own self here very bitterly, and very often, but I fear I might chide
   many of you, too. You had an opportunity yesterday but you lost it. You
   might have spoken for Christ but you did not. No one can tell the good
   you might have done, but you did not do it. You were backward. Oh, as
   the Holy Spirit glorifies Christ everywhere, so do you! I pray you do
   this always, not merely at particular times, but make your whole life a
   glorifying of Christ.

   As I sat on an omnibus yesterday, I heard a man saying behind me how
   greatly he admired the continental way of keeping Sundays--going to
   Church in the morning, and going to the theater at night. "Don't you
   see," he said, "it is irrational to think that the Almighty expects us
   to spend the whole day in praying. There is no man living who can pray
   for six hours together, let alone twelve." That was just putting in
   broad language what most ungodly people feel. I wonder what they would
   make of the Apostle Paul's admonition, "Pray without ceasing." Here was
   a man who thought that nobody could pray for six hours together, while
   the saints of God are to continue always in prayer.

   No man comes up to the stature of the Christian, or such a man as he
   should be, unless he cannot only pray for six hours together but his
   whole life long. It was said of good old Rowland Hill that people did
   not so much notice his particular times of retirement, for he was a man
   who was always praying, wherever he might be. You would often find him
   alone talking to himself. And even in company his heart would be going
   away to the object of his best love--he would still be in communion
   with Christ.

   Be always glorifying Christ, Christians, from the rising of the sun
   unto the going down thereof. Whether you work at a lap stone, or drive
   a plow, or lay the stones in a building--serve the Master in all these
   things. Whether you are diligent with the pen, or whether you buy and
   sell, or plow the sea--do all even to your eating or your drinking in
   the name of the Lord Jesus--and so like the Holy Spirit let it be said
   of you, "He shall glorify Me."

   We conclude by endeavoring to magnify our Master ourselves. I want to
   say just two or three things to glorify Him and they shall be just
   these. I shall say this to the poor troubled doubting sinner, "Sinner,
   my Master is able to save you." "Oh but I am the biggest sinner out of
   Hell." Yes, and He is the greatest of all Saviors. "Yes, but I have
   gone over head and ears in iniquity." Yes, and He was baptized also in
   His agonies that He might save you. "Oh but He cannot save me!" Yes! He
   can! And if I am now addressing the scum of the earth, one of the
   devil's sweepings, one who is hardly fit for decent company, my Master
   is able to save you. Unto the uttermost He saves, and your sin, though
   black, He can cleanse and make you whiter than snow.

   I would say something else to glorify Him. He is willing to save you.
   His generous heart desires you. Your perishing will not make Him glad,
   but He will weep over you as He did over Jerusalem. But your being
   saved will give Him to see of the travail of His soul. "Do you know who
   you are speaking to, Sir?" No I don't, but my Master does. For now He
   fixes His poor tearful eyes on you. Where is the sinner? Behind that
   pillar? Or in yonder corner? The Master looks at him, and He says,
   "Come unto Me all you that labor and are heavy laden and I will give
   you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn of Me, for I am meek and
   lowly of heart and you shall find rest unto your souls."

   What? Are you so far away? How loudly does He call you, "Come, Sinner,
   repent and come." Are you willing to come? Lo! He meets you! In the
   road He meets you--embracing you, He falls upon your neck to kiss you.
   He says, even this morning, He says it, "Take off his rags and clothe
   him in fine apparel. Wash him and make him clean, for I have put away
   his sins like a cloud, and like a thick cloud his iniquities."

   That which glorifies Christ the most of all is the preaching of the
   Gospel to sinners, and therefore have I glorified Him now and would do
   so as long as I live. Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be
   saved, for he that believes and is baptized shall be saved. He that
   believes not shall be damned. God give us to glorify Christ by trusting
   in Him! Amen.

                                The Loaded Wagon

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 24, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of
   sheaves."

   Amos 2:13.

   THE other Sunday morning we went into the corn fields to glean with
   Boaz and Ruth. And I trust that many of the timid and faint-hearted
   were encouraged to partake of the handfuls which are let fall on
   purpose for them by the order of our generous Lord. We go, today, to
   the gate of the harvest field with another object--to see the wagon
   piled up aloft with many sheaves, come creaking forth--making ruts as
   the toiling horses drag it from the field. We come with gratitude to
   God, thanking Him for the harvest, blessing Him for so much of
   favorable weather and praying Him to continue the same till the last
   shock of corn shall be brought in and the farmers everywhere shall
   shout the "Harvest Home."

   What a picture is a wagon loaded with corn for you and of me, as loaded
   with God's mercies! From our cradle up till now, every day has added a
   sheaf. What more could He do for us than He has done? He has daily
   loaded us with benefits. Despite the sad affliction in the North, we
   are nationally a favored people. Both in Providence and in gracious
   privilege, He has blessed us above all people that are upon the face of
   the earth. While other countries have been crushed by tyrants, ravaged
   by war, or left in the thick darkness of superstition, we are free--we
   are blessed with the light of Heaven--we have the Gospel in our
   streets, the Bible in our houses, and the Sunday as our choicest
   heritage.

   O England! You are like a farm wagon creaking under the mercies of God!
   Brothers and Sisters, we are each of us like the cart that is pressed
   down because it is full of sheaves. The innumerable mercies of God are
   piled upon us high as the mountains, nor can our memory recount the
   tokens of the tenderness and loving kindness of the Most High. Let us
   adore His goodness and yield Him our cheerful gratitude.

   Alas--and how many times shall I repeat that pathetic
   interjection--alas! alas! Alas--that such a metaphor should be capable
   of another reading? That while God loads us with mercy, we should load
   Him with sin? While He continually heaps on sheaf after sheaf of favor,
   we also add iniquity unto iniquity, till the weight of our sin becomes
   intolerable to the Most High, and He cries out by reason of the burden,
   saying, "I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of
   sheaves."

   Our text begins with a "Behold!" and well it may. "Beholds" are put in
   the Bible as sometimes a hand is put in the margin of old books, to
   indicate to the reader something worthy of notice. Or, again, "Beholds"
   are put in the Scriptures as signs are put out in front of houses of
   business to attract attention. There is something new, something
   important, something deeply impressive and worthy of attention,
   wherever we see a "Behold" in Sacred Scripture. I see this "Behold"
   standing as it were, like a maiden upon the steps of the house of
   Wisdom, crying, "Turn in here, O you that are wise, and listen to the
   voice of God while He speaks to you."

   Let us open our eyes that we may see. Let us fix both our eyes intently
   that we may "behold," and may God make a way through our eyes and ears
   to our heart--so that deep repentance and self-abhorrence may take hold
   upon us-- because of our evil conduct towards our gracious God.

   Now, it is to be understood, dear Friends, before we proceed farther,
   that our text is but a figure, since God is not to be oppressed by man.
   All the sin that man can commit can never disturb the serenity of His
   perfections, nor cause so much as a wave upon the sea of His
   everlasting calm. He does but speak to us after the manner of man and
   bring down the sublimities and mysteries of Heaven to the feebleness
   and ignorance of earth. He talks to us as a great father may talk to
   his little child, and He uses images which are rather adapted to human
   frailty than to Divine infinity.

   Just, then, as a cart has the axles bent and--to use an old Saxon
   word--as the wheels "screak" under the excessive load, so the Lord says
   that under the load of human guilt He is pressed down, until He cries
   out, because He can bear no longer the iniquity of those that offend
   Him. We shall now turn to the first point, this morning. O that the
   Holy Spirit may make it pointed to our consciences!

   I. The first and most apparent truth in the text is, that SIN IS VERY
   GRIEVOUS AND BURDENSOME TO GOD.

   Be astonished, O heavens and be amazed, O earth, that God should speak
   of being pressed and weighed down! I do not read anywhere so much as
   half a suggestion that the whole burden of creation is any weight to
   the Host High. "He takes up the isles as a very little thing." "He
   weighs the mountains in scales and the hills in balances." Neither sun,
   nor moon, nor stars, nor all the ponderous orbs which His Omnipotence
   has created, cost Him any labor whatever in their sustenance. The
   heathens might picture Atlas as stooping beneath the tremendous load of
   the world--but the eternal God, who bears up the pillars of the
   universe, "faints not, neither is He weary."

   Nor do I find even the most distant approach to a suggestion, that
   Providence fatigues its Lord. He watches both by night and day. His
   power goes forth every moment. It is He who brings forth Mazzaroth in
   his season and guides Arctu-rus with his sons. He bears up the
   foundations of the earth! And He holds the cornerstone thereof. He
   causes the day-spring to know its place, and sets a boundary to
   darkness and the shadow of death. All things are supported by the power
   of His hand, and there is nothing without Him. If He withdrew His
   might, back to annihilation must all things go.

   Just as in a moment, foam subsides into the wave that bears it, and is
   lost forever, so would the universe depart if the eternal God did not
   daily sustain it. Nor has this incessant working diminished His
   strength, nor is there any failing or thought of failing. He does all
   things, and when they are done they are as nothing in His sight. But
   strange, oh, passing strange, marvelous, miraculous among miracles, sin
   burdens God, though the world cannot! And iniquity presses the Most
   High, though the whole tremendous load of Providence is as the small
   dust of the balance.

   Ah, you careless men, sons of Adam, you think sin a trifle. And as for
   you, you sons of Belial, you count it sport and say, "He regards not.
   He sees not. How does God know? And if He knows, He cares not for our
   sins." Learn from the Book of God that so far is this from being the
   truth, that your sins are a grief to Him, a burden and a load to Him,
   till, like a cart that is pressed down with sheaves, so is He pressed
   down by human guilt.

   I think this will be very clear if we meditate for a moment upon what
   sin is, and what sin does. Sin is the great de-spoiler of all God's
   works. It was sin that turned an archangel into an archfiend, and
   angels of light into spirits of evil. It was sin that looked on Eden
   and withered every leaf in its garden and blasted all its flowers.
   Before sin had come, the Creator said of the newly made earth, "It is
   very good." But when sin had entered, it grieved God at His very heart
   that He had made such a creature as man. Nothing can despoil the beauty
   in which God delights so much as sin, for sin mars His image and erases
   His superscription.

   Moreover, sin makes God's creatures unhappy, and shall He not,
   therefore, abhor it? God never designed that any creature that He made
   should be miserable. He made the creatures on purpose that they should
   be glad. He gave the birds their songs, the flowers their perfume, the
   air its balm. He gave to nature the smiling sun, and even to night its
   coronet of stars, for He intended that smiles should be His perpetual
   worship, and that joy should be the atmosphere which His creatures
   breathed. But sin has made God's favorite creature a wretch, brought
   down His most glorious offspring, made in His own image, to become
   naked and poor and miserable and lost.

   Therefore God hates sin and is pressed down under it, because it makes
   the objects of His love unhappy at their heart. All the unhappiness
   that we have this morning comes directly or indirectly from sin.
   Iniquity is the mother of every human pang. Oh, how well may God hate
   it when He sees His own dearly beloved children made to wear furrows on
   their brow and tears in their eyes, because of this vile, this
   abominable thing called sin.

   Moreover, remember, Beloved, that sin attacks God in all His
   attributes. Sin attacks Him on His Throne and stabs at His existence.
   What is sin, Sinner? Is it not an insult to God's wisdom? God bids you
   do His will. When you do the contrary it is because you do as much as
   say, "I know best what is good for me." You do in effect declare that
   infinite wisdom is in error, and that you, the creature of a day, can
   judge better then your God what shall be the path of happiness for you.
   Sin impugns His goodness. By sin you actually declare that God has
   denied you that which would make you happy, which is not the part of a
   good, tender, and loving Father.

   A generous God denies nothing to His creatures but that which is
   harmful. But inasmuch as you think sin to be pleasant and profitable,
   you cast a slur upon the benevolence and loving kindness of God. And
   when He is such a God, so full of tenderness that His very name is
   "Love," this is no slight burden to His holy soul, to feel when He
   perceives you think you could do better for yourself than He is willing
   to do--and that He has cruelly robbed you of pleasure and denied you
   that which would be for your good. Sin cuts at the Lord's wisdom with
   one hand and at His goodness with the other.

   And see, sin also abuses the mercy of God. When you, as many of you
   have done, sin with the higher hand because of His long-suffering
   towards you--when, because you have no sickness, no losses, no crosses,
   therefore you spend your time in revelry and obstinate rebellion--what
   is this but taking the mercy which was meant for your good and turning
   it into mischief? It is no small grief to the loving Father to see His
   substance spent with harlots in riotous living. I tell you it is no
   slight thing to the Father of the prodigal to see Him wish to fill his
   belly with the husks the swine eat. This touches Him at the very quick.
   He cannot endure it, that His children should be thus degraded as to
   turn even the mercy which would woo them to repentance, into a ground
   why they should sin the more against Him.

   Besides, let me remind the careless and impenitent this morning, that
   every sin is a defiance of Divine power. In effect it is lifting your
   puny fists against the majesty of Heaven and defying God to destroy
   you. Every time you sin, you know that sin will lead to your soul's
   destruction. If, then, you beard the Omniscient One even to His face,
   and while under the hand that can crush you, you dare to revolt and to
   transgress, you do as much as dare and defy the Lord to prove whether
   He can maintain His Law or not. Is this a slight thing, that a worm,
   the creature of a day, should defy the God of Ages, the God that fills
   and upholds all things by the Word of His power?

   Well may He be weary when He has to bear with such provocations and
   insults as these! Mention what attribute you will, and sin has blotted
   it. Speak of God in any relationship you choose, and sin has cast a
   slur upon Him. It is evil, only evil, and that continually. In every
   view of it, it must be offensive to the Most High. Sinner, do you know
   that every act of disobedience to God's Law is virtually an act of high
   treason? What do you do but seek to be God yourself, your own master,
   your own lord? Every time you swerve from His will, it is to put your
   will into its place. It is to make yourself a God and to undeify the
   Most High.

   And is this a little offense, to snatch from His brow the crown and
   from His hand the scepter? I tell you it is such an act that Heaven
   itself could not stand unless it were resented. And if this crime were
   suffered to go unpunished, the wheels of Heaven's commonwealth would be
   taken from their axles and the whole frame of nature would be unhinged.
   Such a treason against God shall certainly be punished.

   And to crown all, sin is an onslaught upon God Himself, for every
   sinner is an atheist at heart. Let his religious profession be what it
   may, he has said in his heart, "No God." He wishes that there were no
   Law and no Supreme Ruler. He desires that God might be forgotten. God
   is not in all his thoughts. Is this a trifle? To be a deicide? To slay
   God? To desire to put Him out of His own world? For the creature to
   declare war against the God that made him and to wish that God might
   cease to be--is this a thing to be winked at? Can the Most High hear it
   and not be pressed down beneath its weight?

   Ah, I pray you do not think that I would make a needless outcry against
   sin and disobedience. It is not in the power of human imagination to
   exaggerate the evil of sin, nor will it ever be possible for mortal
   lips, though they should be touched like those of Elijah, with a live
   coal from off the altar, to thunder out the ten-thousandth part of the
   enormity of the least sin against God. Think, dear Friends! We are His
   creatures and yet we will not do His will! We are fed by Him. The
   breath in our nostrils He gives to us, and yet we spend that breath in
   murmuring and in rebellion.

   Once more, we are always in the sight of our Omniscient God, and yet
   the Presence of God is not enough to compel us to obedience. Surely, if
   a man should insult the law in the very presence of the lawgiver--if
   the king were insulted to his face--that were not to be tolerated. But
   this is your case and mine. We must confess, "Against You, You only,
   have I sinned and done this evil in Your sight." And we must remember
   that we are doing all this and we know what we are doing. We are not
   sinning like the Hottentot. We are not pulling God's Law to pieces like
   some blind New Zealander.

   We, in England, sin against extraordinary light and sevenfold
   knowledge. And is this a light thing? Can you expect that God shall
   wink at us and pass by such offenses as these? Oh that these lips had
   language, that this heart could burn for once! If I could declare the
   horrible infamy of sin it would make the blood chill in even a haughty
   Pharaoh's veins, and proud Nebuchadnezzar might bow his head in fear.
   It is a horrible thing, indeed, to have rebelled against the Most High.
   God have mercy upon His servants and forgive them.

   This is our first point but I cannot teach it to you. Only God can
   teach it by His Spirit. O that the Holy Spirit may make you feel that
   sin is exceedingly sinful, because it is grievous and burdensome to
   God.

   II. Secondly, SOME SINS ARE MORE ESPECIALLY GRIEVOUS TO GOD. The
   connection of our text will help you to see the force of this
   observation. There is no such thing as a little sin, but still, there
   are degrees of guilt, and it were folly to say that a sinful thought
   has in it the same extent of evil as a sinful act. A filthy imagination
   is sinful-- wholly sinful and greatly sinful--but still the act has
   attained a higher degree of provocation.

   Now, there are sins that especially provoke God. In the connection of
   the text we read that licentiousness does this. The people seem, from
   the 7th verse, to have gone to a very high degree of fornication and
   lecherousness. This sin is not uncommon in our day. Let our midnight
   streets and our divorce courts be the witness. Perhaps the saddest
   proof that society is far from pure is found in the fact that seducers
   and fornicators, if they are but gentlemen, may enter respectable
   society. Brand the miscreants, I say. If the woman is shut out as a
   harlot, what shall be done unto the lustful maker and cherisher of
   harlots? If Hell burns hotter at one time than another, it is for those
   who make what should have been a temple of the Holy Spirit into an
   instrument of rebellion against both man and God.

   Oppression, too, according to the text, is another great sin. The
   Prophet speaks of selling the poor for a pair of shoes. And there are
   such who would grind the widow and the orphan to the last extreme and
   make their laborers toil for nothing. How many business men we have who
   never knew what "hearts of mercy" were? Men form themselves into
   societies, and then exact an outrageous usury upon loans from the
   unhappy men who fall into their hands. Cunning legal quibbles and
   crafty evasions of just debts often amount to heavy oppression and are
   sure to bring down the anger of the Most High.

   Then again, it seems that idolatry and blasphemy are most certainly
   offensive to Him and have a high degree of hei-nousness. He says that
   they drank the wine of false gods, so if any man set up his belly as
   his god, or his gold, or his wealth, and lives to these, instead of
   living to the Most High, he has offended by idolatry.

   Especially is blasphemy a God-provoking sin. For blasphemy there is no
   excuse. As George Herbert says, "Lust and wine plead a pleasure. There
   is gain to be pleaded for avarice, but the cheap swearer from his open
   sluice lets his soul run for nothing." There is nothing gained by it.
   There can be no pleasure in cursing--blasting one's limbs and damning
   one's soul--this must be offending for offending's sake, and therefore
   this is a high and crying sin. God does pardon it, He is willing to
   pardon it now--but it nevertheless weighs upon His heart and He cannot
   suffer it to go unpunished unless it be repented of.

   Some sins make the Lord very weary of man. Now, I do not know who you
   are, many of you this morning, but I have no doubt there are some among
   you to whom this word may be a personal accusation. Do I address the
   lecherous, or the oppressive, or the swearer? Do I address the profane?
   Ah, Soul, what a mercy God has borne with you for so long. The time
   will come, however, when He will say, "Ah, I will ease Me of My
   adversaries," and how easily will He cast you off and appoint you an
   awful destruction.

   Again, while some sins are thus grievous to God for their peculiar
   heinousness, many men are especially obnoxious to God because of the
   length of their sin. That gray-headed man--how many times has he
   provoked the Most High? Why, those who are but lads have cause to count
   their years, and apply their hearts unto wisdom because of the length
   of time they have lived in rebellion. But what shall I say of you that
   have been half a century in open war against God--and some of you
   sixty, seventy--what if I said near upon eighty years? Ah, you have had
   eighty years of mercies and eighty years of forgetfulness. Eighty years
   of bounty, and eighty years of ingratitude and insult! O God, well may
   You be wearied by the length and number of man's sins!

   Furthermore, God takes special note and feels a special weariness of
   sin that is mixed with obstinacy. Oh, how obstinate some men are! They
   will be damned. There is no helping them. They seem as if they would
   leap the Alps to reach perdition, and swim through seas of fire that
   they may destroy their own souls. I might tell you cases of men that
   have been sore sick of fever, malaria, and cholera. They have recovered
   from all--but have only recovered their health to return to their
   wallowing in the mire.

   Some of them have had such troubles in business, thick and threefold.
   They were once in respectable circumstances, but they spent their
   living riotously and they became poor. They still struggle on in sin.
   They are growing poorer still-- most of their clothes have gone to the
   pawn shop. But they will not turn from the gin shop and the haunt of
   vice. An- other child is dead! Ah, has that man yonder a dead child at
   home? And the wife is sick and nothing but starvation looks the family
   in the face!

   But they have gone on still with a high hand and an outstretched arm.
   This is obstinacy, indeed. Sinner! God will let you have your own way
   one of these days, and that way will be your everlasting ruin. But God
   is weary of all here who have thus set themselves to do mischief, and
   who against warnings, and invitations and entreaties, and light, and
   knowledge, have determined to go on in sin.

   The context seems to tell us that ingratitude is intensely burdensome
   to God. He tells the people how He brought them up out of Egypt. How He
   cast out the Amorites. How He raised up their sons for Prophets and
   their young men for Nazarites. And yet they rebelled against Him! Oh,
   dear Friends, this was one of the things that pricked my heart when I
   first came to God as a guilty sinner--not so much the peculiar
   heinousness of my outward life, as the peculiar mercies that I had
   enjoyed. How many of us have been detestably ungrateful! What a life
   has our life been!

   Oh, how generous God has been. Why there are some of us who never had a
   want. All our wants have been supplied. God has never cast us into
   poverty, nor left us to infamy, nor given us up to evil example. He has
   kept us moral, and made us love His House even when we did not love
   Him. And all this He has done year after year. What poor returns have
   we made! To you, His people, what joy He has given, what deliverances,
   what love, what comfort, what bliss--and yet after all this, to think
   that we should sin to His very face! Oh, well may He be as a cart that
   is pressed down, that is full of sheaves!

   O my Hearers, I know I address some to whom this may come home very
   pointedly. What? When you were nearly drowned, were you snatched from
   the jaws of death? What? Were you rescued from sickness? Were you
   blessed with that godly mother, and did that companion plead with you?
   Have you a tender conscience? Do you feel that you cannot sin as others
   do, for something checks you? All this is God's love. But if you will
   still rebel against Him, despite all this, well may He arise in His
   wrath and shake Himself in His hot displeasure. He will not always
   strive with man. Justice shall soon have its day.

   Let me observe, before I leave this point, that it seems from our text
   that the Lord is so pressed, that He even cries out. Just as the cart,
   when laden with the sheaves, groans under the weight, so the Lord cries
   out under the load of sin. Have you ever heard those accents? "Hear, O
   hearers and give, O earth: for the Lord has spoken, I have nourished
   and brought up children and they have rebelled against Me." Hear
   again--"Turn you, turn you from your evil ways. For why will you die, O
   house of Israel?" Better still, hear it from the lips of Christ,
   softened down to our own ears--"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill
   the Prophets and stone them which are sent unto you. How often would I
   have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her
   chickens under her wings and you would not!"

   Sinner, God is cut to the heart by your sin! Your Creator grieves over
   that which you laugh at. Your Creator cries out in His Spirit
   concerning that which you think to be a trifle. "O do not this
   abominable thing which I hate!" For God's sake do it not! We often say
   "for God's sake," without knowing what we mean. But here, see what it
   means--for the sake of God--that you grieve not your Creator--that you
   cause not the Eternal One, Himself, to cry out against you. Cease you,
   cease you, "from your evil ways. For why will you die, O house of
   Israel?" I now leave those two points to pass on very briefly to the
   next.

   III. While it is true that sin is grievous to the Lord, it magnifies
   His mercy when we see that HE BEARS THE LOAD. As the cart is not said
   to break, but is only pressed, so is He pressed, and yet He bears. That
   hymn we sung just before the sermon has more in it than hard hearts
   will feel--

   "Lord and am I yet afire,
   Not in torments, not in Hell?
   Still does Your good Spirit strive--
   With the chief of sinners dwell?
   Tell it unto sinners, tell,
   I am, I am out of Hell."

   If you and I were in God's place, should we have borne it? No, within a
   week we should have burned the universe with fire, or trod it to powder
   beneath our feet. If God were like modern lawgivers--and here I find no
   fault with them, for the law of a commonwealth must be unyielding--but
   if the Law of Heaven were as swift to punish as the law of man, where
   would we be? I do not find you rising up to plead for the man who
   murdered his children, and from some fancied injury shot his fellow
   man. We seem to say by a unanimous verdict, "The wretch is guilty, let
   him be punished."

   What a universal howl has been going up this week against an offender
   who once stood fair in the midst of us, but who turned aside long ago
   unto iniquity. What man pleads for him? Who stands up and says, "Let
   William Roupell go unpunished"? Yet, here is God, and here are we whose
   offenses are ten times more heinous against God than any man's offenses
   can be against man--and yet He spares us. Remember, He has all the
   while full power to punish. He has but to wish and it is done--to lift
   His finger and we are crushed before Him.

   How many servants wait around Him ready to do His bidding? As the Roman
   consul went out, attended by his lic-tors carrying the axe, so God is
   ever attended by His executioners, who are ready to fulfill His
   sentence. A stone, a tile from the roof of the house, a thunderbolt, a
   puff of wind, a grain of dust, a broken blood vessel, and it is
   over--and you are dead and in the hands of an angry God. Indeed, the
   Lord has to hold in the followers of His wrath and restrain the
   servants of His anger, for the heavens cry, "Why should we cover that
   wretch's head?" Earth asks, "Why should I yield a harvest to the
   sinner's plow?" The lightning and thunder say, "Let us smite the
   rebel," and the seas roar upon the sinner, desiring him as their prey.

   There is no greater proof of the Omnipotence of God, than His
   long-suffering. It shows the greatest possible power for God to be able
   to control Himself, to be able to keep in an anger which naturally must
   boil, and restrain a fury which else must burn. Sinner, yet He bears
   with you. The angels have been astonished at it--they thought He would
   strike. But yet He bears with you. Have you ever seen a patient man
   insulted? He has been met in the street by a villain who insults him
   before a mob of boys. He bears it. The fellow spits in his face. He
   bears it still. Now he strikes him. He endures it quietly.

   "Give him a charge," says one. "No," says he, "I forgive him all." The
   fellow knocks him down and rolls him in the ditch, but he bears it
   still. Yes, and when he rises all covered with mire, he says, "If there
   is anything that I can do to befriend you, I will do it now." Just at
   that moment the wretch is arrested by a sheriffs officer for debt. The
   man who has been insulted takes out his purse and pays the debt and
   says, "Now you may go free." Look! The wretch spits in his face after
   that!

   Now you say "Let him feel what you can do. Let the law have its way
   with him." Is there any room for patience now? So would it have been
   with man. It has not been so with God. We have done much worse than
   this and He has acted much more nobly. And still, I say, He bears it
   all. Though like the cart, He is pressed under the load of sheaves, yet
   like the cart the axle does not break. He bears the load. He bears with
   impenitent sinners still.

   IV. And this brings me now to pass over to the fourth head, on which I
   would have your deepest attention. Many here present, I fear, have
   never repented of sin. You have never seen it in the light of grieving
   God, or else methinks you would not wish to grieve Him. But, perhaps
   some of you feel how evil a thing rebellion is, but you want to know
   how you can get rid of it.

   This is our fourth head. Not only does God still bear with sin, but
   GOD, IN THE PERSON OF HIS SON, DID

   BEAR AND TAKE AWAY SIN. These words might have deep meaning if uttered
   by the lips of Jesus, "I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed
   that is full of sheaves." Here stood the great problem. God must punish
   sin, and yet He would have mercy. How could it be? Lo! Jesus comes to
   be the Substitute far all who trust Him. See how they pile on Him the
   sheaves of human sin! There are MY sheaves of sin--

   "My soul looks back to see,
   The burden You did bear,
   When hanging on the cursed tree,
   And hopes her guilt was there." Here are your sheaves, my Hearer--the
   sheaves of all His chosen, the sins of all who shall believe in Him!
   "The Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all." Yes, the Scripture
   has it, "He is the propitiation for our sin and not for ours only, but
   for the sins of the whole world." There they lie, heaps on heaps, till
   He is pressed down like the wagon that groans as it moves along. He is
   despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with
   grief." See Him, He did "sweat as it were, great drops of blood falling
   to the ground." "He that eats bread with Me has lifted up His heel
   against Me."

   They sold Him for thirty pieces of silver, a goodly price did they
   value Him. Nevertheless, He is taken from prison and from judgment, and
   who shall declare His generation? Herod mocks Him and makes nothing of
   Him. Pilate jeers Him. They have smitten the Prince of Judah upon the
   cheek. "I gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that
   plucked off the hair. I hid not My face from shame and spitting." They
   have tied Him to the pillar. They are beating Him with rods, not this
   time forty stripes save one--there is no "save one" with Him, for the
   chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and "with His stripes we are
   healed."

   Look at Him, like a cart pressed down with sheaves He goes through the
   streets of Jerusalem. Well may you weep, you daughters of Jerusalem,
   though He bids you dry your tears. They hoot Him as He walks along
   bowed beneath the load of His own Cross which was the emblem of your
   sin and mine. They have brought Him to Golgotha. They throw Him on His
   back, they stretch out His hands and His feet. The accursed iron
   penetrates the most tender parts of His body, where most of the nerves
   congregate. They lift up the Cross. O bleeding Savior! Your time of woe
   is come! They dash it into the socket with rough hands, the nails are
   tearing through His hands and feet.

   He hangs in extremity, for God has forsaken Him. His enemies persecute
   and take Him, for there is none to deliver Him. They mock His
   nakedness. They point at His agonies. They look and stare upon Him with
   ribald jests. They insult His griefs and make puns upon His prayers. He
   is now, indeed, a worm and no man, crushed till you can scarcely think
   that there is Divinity within. The fever gets hold upon Him. His tongue
   is dried up like a potsherd and He cries, "I thirst!" Vinegar is all
   they yield Him.

   The sun refuses to shine and the thick midnight darkness of that awful
   midday, is a fitting emblem of the tenfold midnight of his soul. Out of
   that thick horror He cries, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"
   Then, indeed, was He pressed down! Oh, there was never sorrow like unto
   His sorrow. All human griefs found a reservoir in His heart, and all
   the punishment of human guilt spent itself upon His body and His soul.
   Oh, shall sin ever be a trifle to us? Shall I laugh at that which made
   Him groan? Shall I toy and dally with that which stabbed Him to the
   heart?

   Sinner, will you not give up your sins for the sake of Him who quivered
   for sin? "Oh," you say, "yes, if I could believe that He suffered for
   my sake." Will you trust your soul in His hands this morning? Do you do
   so? Then He died for you and took your guilt and carried all your
   sorrows, and you may go free, for God is satisfied, and you are
   absolved. Christ was burdened that you might be lightened. He was
   pressed with your sheaves, that you might find deliverance. I wish I
   could talk of my precious Master as He might speak of Himself. Or as
   John might speak, who saw Him and bore witness. He could tell in
   plaintive tones of the sorrows of the Man of Calvary. But such as I
   have, I give you. O that God would give you with it the power, the
   Divine Grace, the blessed compulsion to believe on Jesus, to believe on
   Jesus NOW!

   V. For if not, and here is our last point, God will bear the load for a
   little while. But if Christ has not borne it for you and for me, then
   THAT SAME LOAD WILL CRUSH US FOREVER AND EVER.

   I find that my text is translated by many learned men in a different
   way from the version before us--"I will press you as a cart that is
   full of sheaves presses your place." That is, just as a heavily loaded
   wagon pressed into the poor Eastern roads, and left there deep
   furrows--furrows you would hardly think of in a land where we
   understand road making so well. Just as deep ridges and ruts were cut
   into the Eastern roads by the loaded wagons, so will I crush you, says
   God, with the load of your sin.

   This is to be your doom, my Hearer, if you are out of Christ. Does it
   need me to enlarge upon this terror? I think not. It only needs that
   you should make a personal application of the threat! Divide yourselves
   now. Divide yourselves, I say! Do you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ?
   Then the threat is not yours. But if you believe not, whether you are
   standing in yonder aisle, or up there in those far-off galleries, I do
   advise you listen to me now, as if you were the only person here--a
   Christless soul must be a damned soul--a spirit that believes not in
   Christ is condemned already, because it believes not.

   How shall you escape if you neglect so great a salvation? Thus says the
   Lord unto you, "Consider your ways." By time, by eternity, by life, by
   death, by Heaven, by Hell, I plead with you--believe in Him who is able
   to save unto the uttermost them that come unto Him. But if you believe
   not that Christ is He, you shall die in your sins. After death the
   judgment! Oh, the judgment, the thundering trumpet, the multitudes, the
   crowds. The books, the Great White Throne, the, "Come, you blessed,"
   the "Depart, you cursed"! After judgment--to a soul that is out of
   Christ--Hell!

   Who among us, who among US shall abide with the devouring flame? Who
   among US, who among US shall dwell with the everlasting burnings? I
   pray that none of us may. But we must unless we fly to Christ. Oh, I
   beseech you, my dear Hearer, fly to Jesus! I may never see your face
   again. Your eyes may never look into mine--but I shake my garments of
   your blood, if you believe not in Christ this morning. My tears entreat
   you, my lips would woo you. There is mercy for you! God has had
   patience with you. Let His long-suffering lead you to repentance. He
   wills not the death of any, but had rather that they should turn unto
   Him and live.

   And this turning is simply this--trust Jesus with your soul, and He
   shall take your sin and you shall stand accepted in the Beloved. Will
   you? No, I know you will not--unless the Spirit of God shall constrain
   you. But at the least, if you will not, it shall not be for want of
   pleading and entreating. Come, it is mercy's welcome hour. I pray you,
   come! Jesus with pierced hands invites you, though you have rejected
   Him. You have stood against Him long--He knocks again-- His undefeated,
   unconquerable love defies your wickedness and will have you.

   Sinner, will you have Him or not? "Whosoever will, let him come and
   take of the water of life freely." God help you to come, God make you
   come, for Christ's sake. Amen.

                           Flesh And Spirit--A Riddle

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 31, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "So foolish was I and ignorant: I was as a beast before You.
   Nevertheless I am continually with You: You have held me by my right
   hand. You shall guide me with Your counsel and afterward receive me to
   glory. Whom ha ve I in Hea ven but You? And there is none upon earth
   that I desire besides You." Psalm 73:22-25.

   OUR Lord Jesus was tempted in all points like we are. With some reserve
   we might almost say the same of David. Of all the worthies whose lives
   are written out at length in Holy Writ, David possesses an experience
   of the most striking, varied and instructive character. In his history
   we meet with temptations, and complications of temptations not to be
   discovered, at least as a connected whole, in other saints of ancient
   times. Trials which stand out in the lives of other men as isolated
   hills form whole chains and ranges of mountains in the case of the son
   of Jesse. David knew the trials of all ranks and conditions of men.

   Kings have their troubles and David wore a crown--the peasant has his
   cares and David handled the shepherd's crook. The wanderer has many
   hardships and David abode in the caves of Engedi--the captain has his
   difficulties and David found the sons of Zeruiah too hard for him. The
   Psalmist of Israel was tried by his friends. His counselor, Ahithophel,
   forsook him. "He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against
   me." His worst foes were of his own household. His children were his
   greatest afflictions. Amnon disgraces him, Absalom excites revolt,
   Adonijah disturbs his dying bed.

   The temptations of poverty and wealth, of honor and reproach, of health
   and sickness, all tried their power upon him. He had tribulations from
   without. I need not remind you that during his long life they came from
   every quarter. He had temptations from within, for the man after God's
   own heart not only knew what it was to be assailed, but to be carried
   by storm, by fierce and terrible passions. I may grant, perhaps, that
   Job's trial was more severe than any that fell to David. But yet I know
   not. Possibly the burning of Ziklag--when his wives were carried away
   captive, and all that he had was consumed, and his men spoke of stoning
   him--may have been even a severer trial than Job's when he sat upon a
   dunghill and scraped himself with a potsherd.

   And I am not sure, but I think that mournful procession over the brook
   Kedron in David's later life, when his own son thirsted for his blood,
   had in it a Gethsemane bitterness that is hardly to be found in the
   tribulation which fell to the Patriarch of Uz. Job must fairly yield
   the palm in one respect, for his was no life-long siege but only one
   sharp and furious attack. David, however, no sooner escaped from one
   trial, than he fell into another. He no sooner emerged from one season
   of despondency and alarm, than he was again brought into the lowest
   depths and all God's waves and billows rolled over him.

   Now, it is from this cause, I take it, that David's Psalms are so
   universally the delight of experienced Christians. Into whatever frame
   of mind we may be cast, David seems to have described our emotions,
   whether they ARE of ecstasy or depression, to the very letter. He was
   an able master of the human heart, because he had been tutored in that
   best of all schools, the school of real, heartfelt, personal
   experience. You will find that as we grow matured in Divine Grace and
   in years, we love the Psalms more.

   Many young Believers are most fond of the doctrinal parts of Scripture,
   and I admire that holy curiosity which leads them to desire to
   understand all the revelation of God in the Doctrines of Grace.
   Practical Christians are often more fond of studying the Evangelists
   and Proverbs. But I find that the gray-headed veterans, the sorely
   troubled Christians, those who have done business on great
   waters--while they love the doctrines, while they delight in the
   practices set forth in the life of Christ--yet somehow or other the
   Psalms of the sweet Singer of Israel yield them savory meat such as
   their soul loves. And they are made in the Psalms to "lie down in green
   pastures" of tender grass.

   Probably the first remark which will be suggested by reading the Psalms
   will be this--how varied they are. What an extraordinary man David is,
   what changes there are in the weather of his soul, what bright sunlight
   days, what dark cloudy nights, what calms as though his life were a sea
   of glass, what terrible trials as if the glass were mingled with fire.
   One time we find him crying, "My God, my God, why have You forsaken
   me," and another he sings, "Bless the Lord, O my Soul and all that is
   within me bless His holy name." One hour we hear him sigh forth, "I
   sink in deep mire where there is no standing," and then we find him
   exulting, "The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear:
   the Lord is the strength of my life, of whom shall I be afraid?"

   How wondrously he rises to Heaven and how awfully he dives into the
   deeps. Surely, Brethren, we who have known anything of spiritual and
   inner life do not marvel at this, for we also change. Alas, what a
   contrast between the sin that does so easily beset us, and the Divine
   Grace which gives us to reign in heavenly places. How different the
   sorrow of an abject distrust which breaks us in pieces as with a strong
   east wind, and the joy of a holy confidence which bears us on to Heaven
   as with a propitious gale!

   What changes between walking with God today, and falling into the mire
   tomorrow. Triumphing over sin, death, and Hell yesterday, and today led
   captive by the lusts of the flesh and of the mind. Verily, we cannot
   understand ourselves, and a description which would suit us yesterday
   would be ill-adapted for today, and quite out of place for tomorrow.
   Scarcely ever are we in the same mind even an hour. Great God, how
   infinitely glorious are You in Your immutability, when contrasted with
   Your fickle, frail, unstable creature--man.

   It falls to my lot, this morning, to open up in some humble measure,
   the secrets of inward experience. I can but hope to do it in a very
   shallow measure, for I am but a youth, and am not worthy to instruct
   some of you who have been men of war from your youth up. Yet I may
   serve the weaklings of the flock, if I inform them of the strife they
   must expect from the flesh, and comfort their hearts with a foretaste
   of the certain victory which the Lord has secured to them through the
   Holy Spirit. We shall first listen to the confessions of the Psalmist
   concerning the flesh. Then, to his expressions with regard to the
   Spirit. Then, to his soul's exultation when looking to both flesh and
   Spirit, he cries out, "Whom have I in Heaven but You? There is none
   upon earth that I desire besides You."

   I. First, we are to listen to THE PSALMIST'S CONFESSION CONCERNING THE
   FLESH.

   Remember, Beloved, this is a saint of God. This is a highly advanced
   saint--this is the man after God's own heart. This is one of the
   special favorites of Heaven--one of the men to whom God revealed
   Himself as He does not unto the world. And yet you hear him telling us
   his inner life, and he begins by saying, "So foolish was I and
   ignorant: I was as a beast before You." The word "foolish," when it
   issues from David's mouth, means more than it signifies in ordinary
   language. To be called a fool is no great compliment to any man. But
   when that word means atheist--despiser of that which is good--when it
   means a forgetter of God, a lover of evil, a destroyer of one's own
   soul, then to be called a fool is something at which a man may take
   offense, indeed.

   David, in one of the former verses of the Psalm, writes, "I was envious
   of the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the wicked," which shows
   that the folly he intended had sin in it. Now he puts himself down as
   being one of these fools, and adds a little word which is to give
   intensity to the adjective--"SO foolish was I." How foolish he could
   not tell. It was a sinful folly, a folly which was not to be excused by
   frailty, but to be condemned because of its perverseness and willful
   ignorance. What? And do we call ourselves wise? Do we, followers of the
   lowly Savior, profess that we have attained perfection, or have been so
   chastened that the rod has whipped all our willfulness out of us?

   Ah, this were pride, indeed! If David was foolish, what fools should
   you and I be in our own esteem if we could but see ourselves. Look
   back, Believer--think of your not trusting God when He has been so
   faithful to you--think of your foolish outcry of, "Not so, my Father,"
   when He crossed His hands in affliction to give you the larger
   blessing. Think, I say, of the many times when you have read His
   Providences in the dark, misinterpreting His dispensations and groaning
   out, "All these things are against me," when they were all working
   together for your good!

   Think how often you have chosen sin because of its pleasure, when
   indeed, that pleasure was a root of pain and bitterness to you! How
   often you have forgotten to honor God when you had noble opportunities
   of serving Him. I, for one, must take my place at the bar and plead
   guilty to the indictment of a sinful folly. And I think everyone who
   knows his own heart, however far advanced in Divine Grace he may be,
   must do the same. In the present tense I put it sorrowfully, "So
   foolish am I."

   Further, our Psalmist adds, "and ignorant." A man who, after years of
   such experience as David, to say, "I am ignorant," must either be very
   humble, or else there must be such a force upon his conscience that he
   cannot resist the confession. And indeed, if you will read the Psalm,
   and see into what a mistake David had fallen--that of envying the
   present prosperity of the ungodly--you may grant that he was ignorant,
   indeed, to forget the dreadful end of those who only prosper that they
   may be fattened like bullocks for the slaughter. But you and I have
   been quite as ignorant. We said yesterday, "Now I shall never doubt God
   again. He has helped me through this great trouble, and I know that I
   shall be able to trust Him, come what may."

   But this very morning you awoke with a distrustful thought. What
   ignorance is this, to forget the lesson which you learned but
   yesterday, and which you thought you knew by heart? Here you have been
   trying for months to resign yourself to God's will. He took away from
   you one very dear to you, and you longed to say, "The Lord gave and the
   Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord." And you did say
   it by an overwhelming effort, but you cannot say it now, for feeling
   has trod down faith. You are so foolish and so ignorant that you have
   forgotten what you vowed to learn. And what you meant to say
   perpetually, you have failed to say in this, perhaps the first great
   trial in your life.

   Some men think when they have learned six or seven doctrines, that now
   they know everything. And certain other folks I know of, when they pass
   through a few years of experience, set themselves up for standards. Ah,
   Beloved, when we think we know best, and fancy that we have grown wise,
   then we prove our folly. Our impudence is engraved on our foreheads,
   and FOOL is written there in capital letters, when we think we are
   wise. Oh, the depths of the wisdom of God! Who can understand the full
   meaning of the Doctrines of Grace! Oh, the depths of the experience of
   the Believer who shall dare to profess that he has passed over all the
   seas, and has crossed all the mountains over which a Believer must
   climb!

   If we could but see ourselves, we should consider our knowledge to be
   nothing, and our ignorance to be all. We are in the twilight, let us
   not call it noon. We are in the mists and fogs, let us not suppose that
   we are in an unclouded atmosphere. When we think we see all wisdom, it
   is because we are blind. And when we fancy we have discovered
   everything, it is because we are mocked by the illusions of our pride,
   and see nothing as yet aright. I know I address some of you who, when
   you are alone, quietly engaged in meditation, think to yourselves
   "Well, if ever there was such a stupid saint as I am, I am much
   mistaken. I seem to have the least understanding of any man. I read the
   Scriptures, and by God's Grace I sometimes get a hold of them, but at
   seasons I cannot for the life of me even believe them to be true. I
   know the power of prayer, but yet there are times when I could not pray
   if my soul depended on it, and can only groan. In fact, sometimes, "if
   anything is felt, it is only pain to find I cannot feel.

   "Yet I have been fed under the ministry. I have had many troubles and
   much communion with Christ, but yet here I am, knowing nothing, just a
   schoolboy, sitting on the lowest form and trying to spell out his A, B,
   Cs--such a thorough fool that I often pride myself upon my knowledge
   and condemn my brother for ignorance, not seeing the beam that is in my
   own eye, trying to pull the mote from his eye." Is this the soliloquy
   of your heart? I know it has often been mine. If it is yours, we have
   just hit the meaning of David when he uses this expression--"So foolish
   was I and ignorant."

   But now comes the crowning word, which you would think too degrading
   for David--"I was as a beast before You." Indeed, the original has in
   it no word of comparison. It ought to be rather translated, "I was a
   very beast before You," and we are told that the Hebrew word being in
   the plural number gives it a peculiar emphasis, indicating some
   monstrous or astonishing beast. It is the word used by Job which is
   interpreted "Behemoth"--"I was a very monster before You"--not only a
   beast but one of the most brutish of all beasts, one of the most
   stubborn and intractable of all beasts.

   I think no man can go much lower than this in humble confession. This
   is a description of human nature, and of the old man in the renewed
   saint which is not to be excelled. How far does this hold true in your
   experience and mine? Well, I think first we have often been made to
   compare ourselves to beasts because of our worldly-mindedness. There is
   the swine grubbing in the earth for its roots. What cares it about the
   stars? And even the fleet horse as it crosses the meadow, what knows it
   about the angels and the harps of Heaven? Educate the beast as you may,
   it has no care beyond its fleshly appetite.

   Oh, how much are we like this, even we who are renewed by Divine Grace!
   The last six days it has been, "Shop, shop, shop," with you from
   morning to night. You bowed at the family altar and you tried to pray
   at eventide but carking care depressed you till it was hard to offer
   real supplication. A thousand things have bewildered you. The cashbook,
   the daybook, those losses, those many workmen to be looked after, or
   the servants in the house have distracted your mind and the world comes
   in till you feel, "O that I could get rid of these things for a moment!
   O that I had wings like a dove, that I might fly away and be at rest!"

   But you cannot, for your soul lies cleaving to the dust. Perhaps there
   comes a knock at the door just when you want to be knocking at God's
   door, and someone wants to see you when you want to see your God. You
   cannot rest in Jesus as you would. You are called upon to look after
   accounts, shillings, five pound notes, creditors and debtors, until you
   cry, "O God, I am like a beast before You. How can I ever hope to enter
   Heaven?" You remember that hymn of Dr. Watts, commencing--

   "Come holy Spirit, heavenly dove." What a sweet beginning, but how
   dolefully true are the middle verses. Surely they never ought to be
   sung but to be sighed--

   "Dear Lord and shall we ever live At this poor dying rate-- Our love so
   faint, so cold to You, And Yours to us so great?" What is this but the
   same confession in other words, "I was as a beast before You."

   Let us add another shade of black to the picture. We might often
   compare ourselves to the beast from our want of any emotion towards
   heavenly things. I am quite sure Rutherford was right when he said, "No
   devil in the world is so bad as having no devil." Not to be tempted, is
   perhaps the worst temptation that can befall a man. There are times--I
   suppose it is so with you, it is with me--times when my soul is like a
   dead calm and these seasons I dread--

   "No stir in the air, no stir in the sea The ship was as still as a ship
   could be." What mariner likes these dead calms? I am sure I tremble to
   encounter more of them. Better the healthy hurricane than the
   pestilential quiet. You would pray, but you cannot command the
   earnestness and fervor you desire. You would repent, you feel that you
   would repent, but no tear will flow, for the heart is hard.

   You would praise God and the lips can utter the words, but the soul
   cannot join the music. You would stir yourself to some lofty emotion
   but you cannot. The heart will not feel, it has grown cold, and a sort
   of death-sleep has come over you like the sleep which is said to fall
   upon the wanderer in the snow when he comes near to death. Oh, to be
   roused from this is a blessing sent from Heaven--to be stirred even
   though it is by a hurricane of affliction, or a thunderclap of trouble.
   It is an awful thing to be in this apathetic state. Then it is that the
   Believer cries, "I am as a beast before You."

   You are dead as the seat you sit on each Sunday. Going to the ordinance
   itself, eating the bread and drinking the wine, yet feeling no
   fellowship with Christ. Joining in the song and loving it but singing
   with no feeling, no heart. Going to Prayer Meetings, feeling you would
   not stay away for all the world, and yet no life, no power, no thought,
   no vigor. Does some young Christian look at me and say, "What? Do old
   Christians feel like that?" I say, "They do, at times." Sad is it that
   we should have to confess man to be so vile, but such he is, and such
   each of us have found ourselves out to be. And let the Believer live
   but a little while, and he will have to use David's language and cry,
   "I was as a beast before You."

   See yet again, how often have we had to complain that we are like the
   beasts for our short-sightedness! The beast cannot look forward to
   eternity. It cannot cast its eye down the centuries and look to the
   fulfillment of prophecy in the fullness of time. It has to be content
   with the things that are near, the things of the hour, and of the day.
   Even so shortsighted are you and I! We think we see the end when we are
   only viewing the beginning. We get our telescope out sometimes to look
   to the future, and we breathe on the glass with the hot breath of our
   anxiety. And then we think we see clouds and darkness before us if we
   are in trouble. We see every day new straits, attend and wonder where
   the scene will end. But we conclude that it must end in our
   destruction.

   "God has forgotten to be gracious," we think, "He has in anger shut up
   His heart of compassion." Oh this shortsightedness! When you and I
   ought to believe in God--when we ought to look at the Heaven that
   awaits us and the glory for which these light afflictions are preparing
   us. When we ought to be looking through the cloud to the Eternal Sun
   which never knows an eclipse! When we should be resting on the
   invisible arm of the immortal God, and triumphing in His love, we are
   mourning and distrusting. God forgive us for this. In these things,
   verily, we have been as beasts before Him.

   I might add again, how often Believers have to complain that the animal
   passions will bestir themselves in them until they feel the beast
   within them. I shall not go deep into this path of painful experience.
   I only hint at it that some who may have been surprised at it as though
   it were a novelty, may know that it is common to man. He that has
   fellowship with God will sometimes feel the devil within him till he
   thinks himself a devil, and sometimes, too, (the Lord have mercy upon
   His servants) when the temptation comes in an unguarded moment they may
   be betrayed and Satan may triumph. If then, they can look back upon a
   burst of anger or sin and not say after it, "I was as a beast before
   You, O God," then I despair of them.

   Other men commit these sins. Other men fall into these iniquities, but
   it remains for the Christian, only, to abhor himself on account of
   them. To sin is no spot of God's children. But to hate sin, humbly to
   confess it, and to lay in the very dust with abasement on account of
   it--this is one of the choice requirements of the truly begotten sons
   of Heaven. Oh, I know that many of you, with a groaning that could not
   be uttered, have been made to feel in your heart that though you are
   the elect of God, and bought with precious blood, and the Spirit of God
   dwells in you, yet still you are, when the flesh prevails, as beasts
   before God.

   In deed, my text, as I have said, seems to make us even worse than the
   beasts, for the comparison which David uses is not to a common and
   ordinary creature, but to some dread monster, a Behemoth. When we look
   within, there is nothing lovely. We are all a mass of distorted parts
   wrongly joined together. There is much of pride, and lust, and
   anger--and what is there of good? Brethren, our Apostle said in him
   there dwelt no good thing, and you and I are no better than he. Nothing
   good but everything that is evil. And all the evil put into the most
   exaggerated form and shape, until he that has seen himself, has been
   ready to go mad to think that he should ever be such a being as he is.

   Grace Divine! O sovereign love! Were it not for these we should lie
   down in despair, when we think of the uncome-liness of our nature. More
   stubborn than Behemoth are we! God can tame the creatures. Man can even
   put a bit into the mouth of the horse, and he has a bridle for the ass.
   But we, more intractable than the brutes, are not to be restrained from
   sin. They are obstinate, but their obstinacy may be quelled and
   overcome. Sometimes harshness and another, kindness, can subdue the
   most stubborn brute. But our tongue and heart can no man tame. Evil,
   only evil, and that continually, still remains in our heart, kicking
   against the pricks even to the last--remaining even unto death like a
   bullock unaccustomed to the yoke.

   What shall I say of human nature as the Christian discovers it in
   himself? I will only say it is impossible to exaggerate its evil.
   Describe it in the blackest and foulest terms, and you shall find,
   after all, Believers who will say man is worse than your black
   portrait, for only David's language will suit us, "So foolish was I and
   ignorant: I was as a beast before You."

   1 shall not dwell longer on this part. I have, indeed, only brought it
   out because I know there are so many young Christians who are
   dreadfully alarmed when they discover what they are by nature and who,
   indeed, begin on a wrong theory by supposing that the Grace of God
   comes to make old Adam new--whereas the Grace of God does not change
   our old nature. It gives us a new nature, which subdues the old--but
   the old nature is there, still. Old Adam is old Adam even when the new
   Adam is in the heart. The flesh is evil, undiluted evil, just as much
   as before Christ entered the soul. Therefore, Divine Grace struggles
   with the flesh, good strives with evil, and the life of the Believer
   becomes a constant and perpetual battle--the one principle striving
   against the other till Divine Grace, at last, gets the victory and the
   saint is "afterwards received to Glory."

   II. We shall now turn to the faithful EXPRESSIONS OF THE SPIRIT and God
   help us while we enlarge upon them. How changed the language now!
   Nothing of the beast, here, but rather the spirit seems to grow angelic
   and to borrow Heaven's harps. Hear its first sweet word like music.
   "Nevertheless." As if, notwithstanding all, not one atom the less was
   it true and certain that David was saved, and accepted, and that the
   blessings he is now about to speak of were his by a perpetual
   entail--"Nevertheless I am continually with You." Here is Divine
   regard. Fully conscious of his own lost es- tate, and of the
   deceitfulness and vileness of his nature, yet, by a glorious burst of
   faith, he says, "Nevertheless I am continually with You"!

   I shall not preach on that, but just let you think it over. Let each
   one soliloquize--"I today, a black and detestable sinner, am
   nevertheless, if I believe in Jesus, continually with God! Continually
   upon His mind, He is always thinking of me for my good. Continually
   before His eyes. The eyes of the Lord never sleep but perpetually watch
   out for my good. Continually in His hands, so that none shall be able
   to pluck me from them until Omnipotence itself shall be overcome.
   Continually on His heart, engraved there, worn there as a memorial,
   even as the high priest wore the names of the twelve tribes upon his
   heart forever.

   Tried and afflicted Soul, vexed with the tempest within, look at the
   calm without. "Nevertheless"--O say it in your heart and suck the
   comfort from it, "I am continually with You." You always think of me, O
   God. The heart of Your love continually yearn towards me. You are
   always making Providence work for my good. You never pluck me from Your
   heart. You have set me as a signet upon Your arm. Your love is strong
   as death--many waters cannot quench it. Your affection is hot as coals
   of juniper and yet, yet it is true, I am as a beast before You, and
   when You look at me You can see nothing in me, apart from Christ, but
   what is debased and beast-like. Surprising Grace, You see me in Christ
   and though in myself, abhorred, You behold me as wearing Christ's
   garments and washed in His blood--

   "With the Savior's garments on Holy as the Holy One."

   And I am thus continually in Your favor--"continually with You." Oh, it
   is a child's faith--an infant faith, to be able to say, "I am with
   God," when I have the light of His favor shining on me. But oh, when I
   see the blackness of my heart, still to believe that I am continually
   with Him--this is a man's faith, what if I say, Brethren--a giant's
   faith? It is so easy when you have many graces and many virtues to say,
   "Christ can save me." Yes, but when your follies stare you in the face,
   when your sins rebuke you, still to say, "Wash me and I shall be whiter
   than snow. Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean," this is faith,
   indeed. Blessed faith is that that does not shut its eye to the
   disease, but seeing it, and knowing all its venom and deadly power,
   still trusts it to the Balm of Gilead, and believes that it can heal!

   But you will notice next that our Psalmist is not content with claiming
   Divine regard, he goes on to speak of Divine help and gracious
   operation. You hold me by the right hand"--Here is a recognition of the
   past. I am black and full of sin and treachery, why have I not fallen
   more? Because Your hand has held me up. O God, if You had not kept Your
   saints, they had been the vilest of transgressors. Oh, what should any
   of us have been, though we may be as stars now, if it had not been for
   God's right hand? What should we have been but black blots forever, if
   God had left us?

   Look back, Beloved, at the temptations from which you have been
   delivered, the trials from which you have es-caped--to what do you owe
   all these? Why, to the fact that He has held you by your right hand and
   is holding you by your right hand now. Let the present be a theme for
   gratitude. At this hour your feet are almost gone, but not quite, for
   He holds you. At this moment you are ready to say, "The Lord has
   forgotten me. God will be gracious no more." But He has as firm a grip
   of you today as ever He had. Oh, what joy it is to feel that God has a
   firm hold of us! If we only feel that we have a hold of Him, then our
   hand may fail. But if He has a hold of us, then neither death nor Hell
   shall ever triumph in casting us down.

   And this is true of the future. He will hold us with His right hand. If
   we believe on Christ today, we shall certainly be kept till we see the
   face of Christ in Glory everlasting. Here am I but a stripling, fresh
   come to the battle, and there may be many years of wars and fighting
   for me but, "I know that He is able to keep that which I have committed
   unto Him against that day." Here are some of you whose hair has turned
   gray with many years of trial in the wilderness. What do you say, has
   God forgotten you? Veterans in God's army, has He forsaken you? Has He
   deserted any of you in the moment of trial? No. Then let us, together,
   young and old, bless His name, that He holds us with His right hand.

   But what next? We must not tarry long on any one sentence. Our Psalmist
   goes on to speak of Divine guidance. "You shall guide me with Your
   counsel," says he. "I am foolish, I shall be sure to choose the wrong
   way. I am ignorant, I do not even know the right way. I am a beast and
   those beastly instincts of mine will constantly lead me astray. But You
   shall guide me by Your counsel." See, Brethren, how he throws himself
   on his God--he will have nothing to do with himself. "YOU shall" is his
   confidence. He is completely weaned from looking within. He casts
   himself flat on his God. "You shall guide me with Your counsel." That
   counsel I take it, means first, God's decrees--

   "He that formed in the womb,
   He shall guide me to the tomb. All my times shall ever be Ordered by
   His wise decree."

   Graciously has He ordained every step of our way from this time till we
   arrive in Heaven. Graciously has He ordained every temptation and
   trial--

   "Not a single shaft can hit, Till the God of love sees fit."

   I shall do, after all, what He decrees, have nothing but what He
   ordains, suffer nothing but what He thinks fit. I shall do nothing
   without His permission or aid. I must prevail, for thus His counsel
   runs to bring His many sons to Glory--"You shall guide me by Your
   counsel." Many people do not like predestination, but I think when they
   get washed up on a rock in some dark troublous day, they will be glad
   to cling to this Truth of God.

   Brethren, I thank God that I know there is as much in the decrees of
   God for a grain of dust that pains my eye, as there is in the cloud and
   tempest. The chaff from the hand of the winnower is steered as the
   stars in their courses. In the great, and in the little, Jehovah
   reigns. Standing in the chariot of Providence He holds the reins, and
   when the horses seem to be wild and to know no bit or bridle, He guides
   them according to His will. O rest in this, Believer--He shall guide
   you with His counsel. But this counsel also represents the written
   Word--His decree is His counsel, His written Word is our counsel, His
   counsel to us.

   Happy is the man who has God's Word always to direct him! What were the
   mariner without his compass? What were the Christian without the Bible?
   This is the unerring chart, the map in which every shoal is described,
   and all the channels from the port of destruction to the haven of
   salvation mapped and marked by One who has sailed along the sea.
   Blessed, blessed be You, O God, that we may trust You to guide us now,
   and guide us even to the end! And all this is to us who are like brutes
   before Him! O my Soul, have you ever known what it is to be thoroughly
   cast down till there was no hope left for you, and yet to be carried up
   till there was no doubt left?

   'Twas but yesterday I knew the whole of this experience in my own
   heart. A more wretched miserable being than I, Hell could scarcely
   produce, and yet a more happy joyful-hearted creature Heaven could
   hardly find. How, you say, how was this? When I looked within and
   marked depravity and death everywhere, my soul was troubled almost unto
   death. But when I looked to Christ and saw the fullness of the
   Covenant, and the complete way in which He covered all my sins and
   blotted out all my iniquity, my spirit was like a bird that had escaped
   from the fowler and soared singing up to Heaven with joy and gratitude.
   "You shall guide me with Your counsel."

   Then comes the last, Divine reception. "And afterward receive me to
   Glory." Oh, how sweet is this--"receive me to Glory." Catch it,
   Christian? I do not want you to think of what I say this morning. I
   want you to think of what you have felt and what your Lord is doing for
   you. He will receive you, to Glory--you! Why, if it had been said, "He
   shall damn you to all eternity," your heart would have said, "Ah, that
   I richly deserve." But He says, "I will receive you to Glory."
   Slipping, sliding, falling, and yet I will bring you safe at last!
   Wandering, erring, straying, yet I will receive you to Glory!

   Full of sin, even to the last, full of sin, haunted with unbelief even
   to your dying hour--tempted, perhaps on your deathbed--your very couch
   a part of the battlefield, and your pillow a castle to be stormed or to
   be defended--yet I will receive you to Glory. Brethren, that moment
   when you and I shall be received into Glory--can we conceive it? You
   are gone, frail body, no more pain. But better still, you are gone,
   vile flesh--no more temptation, no more sin. Old Adam, you shall rot.
   Let the worms devour you--glad am I to be rid of you--

   "Far from a world of grief and sin,

   With God eternally shut in.

   And this is your portion and my portion, though doubts and fears
   prevail, and we hardly dare to say that Christ is ours. Yet, resting on
   Him, on Him only, having nothing of our own, looking to His flowing
   wounds, covered with His matchless righteousness, saved at last we
   shall be, and we will sing forever to that matchless Divine Grace which
   saved us even to the end.

   III. To conclude, the Psalmist has been looking at his complex self--at
   the flesh and groaning over it. And then at his spirit, confident in
   its God, and he winds up the whole story thus--"WHOM HAVE I IN HEAVEN
   BUT YOU?" I have known men lose their property and yet they did not
   say, "Whom have I in Heaven but You?" I have known a man lose his wife
   and yet look to earth to find some comfort. I have known him lose child
   after child, and yet he still thought the world had many charms. I have
   known him sick, yet he has had pleasure in vanity.

   But there is one thing which cannot happen--a man cannot know himself
   so as to feel his folly and his ignorance, to feel the beast-like
   character of his nature, without at once turning his eye to Christ.
   There is nothing that makes one love Christ, I think, so much as a
   sense of His love balanced with a sense of our unworthiness of it. It
   is sweet to think that Christ loves us. But oh, to remember that we are
   black as the tents of Kedar, and yet He loves us! This is a thought
   which may well wean us from everything else besides. That He should
   love me when I have some graces and some virtues is not a great marvel.
   But that He should love me, when in me, that is, in my flesh, there
   dwells no good thing?

   When I have no charms, no beauties, not one attractive attribute, not
   one trait of character that is worthy of His regard--that He should
   love me then--oh, if this does not make me swear a divorce to the
   world, what can? Methinks, Believer, you will come to Jesus and put
   your hand in His and say, "You, You alone are mine. No other love can I
   have but this. I cannot love the world, when I have known such
   affection as Yours. And when I see how little I deserve it, I must love
   You." Then, the spirit flies to Heaven, thinking of all that joy and
   rapture which is to come, but remembering, as it enters Paradise, that
   it was on earth but as a beast before God.

   It looks all round through Heaven and says to angels, "I cannot think
   of you, I can only think of Him who could love so base, so vile a
   creature as I am." Surely, passing by principalities and powers,
   forgetting for awhile the blood-washed company, the sacramental host of
   God's elect, we shall look for the Throne where Jesus sits, and we
   shall sing to Him and this shall be the song, "Unto Him that loved us
   and washed us from our sins in His own blood, unto Him be glory forever
   and ever." Contemplate much, Believer, your own sad state, contemplate
   yet more your own safety and perfection in Christ. And these two things
   together shall make you despise the world and its joys, make you tread
   on the world and its trials, and make you feel such a knitting and
   union of heart to Christ, to Christ Jesus only, that you may say, "Whom
   have I in Heaven but You? And there is none upon earth that I desire
   beside You."

   I thought I saw just now before my eyes a dark and horrible pit and
   down deep below, where the eyes could not reach, lay a being broken in
   pieces, whose groans and howling pierced the awful darkness and amazed
   my ears. Methought I saw a bright one fly from the highest Heaven and
   in an instant dive into that black darkness till he was lost and buried
   in it. I waited for a moment and to my mind's eye I saw two spirits
   rising from the horrid deep, with arms entwined, as though one was
   bearing up the other, I saw them emerge from the gloom. I heard the
   fairest of them say, as He mounted into light, "I have loved you and
   given Myself for you."

   And I heard the other say, who was that poor broken one just now, "I
   was foolish and ignorant, I was as a beast before You." Before I could
   write the words both spirits had risen into mid air and I heard one of
   them say "You shall be with Me in Paradise," and the other whispered,
   "Nevertheless I am continually with You." As they mounted higher, I
   heard One say, "None shall pluck you out of My hand," and I heard the
   other say "You hold me by my right hand." As still they rose they
   continued the loving dialogue. "I will guide you with My eyes," said
   the bright One. The other answered, "You shall guide me with Your
   counsel."

   They reached the bright clouds that separate earth from Heaven and as
   they parted to make way for the glorious One, He said, "I will give you
   to sit upon My Throne even as I have overcome and sit upon My Father's
   Throne," and the other answered, "And You shall afterward receive me to
   Glory." Lo the clouds closed their doors and they were gone. Methought
   again they opened and I saw those two spirits soaring onward beyond
   stars and sun and moon--right up beyond principalities and powers--on,
   beyond cherubim and seraphim. Right on beyond every name that is named,
   until in that ineffable brightness, dark with insufferable light, the
   awful glory of the Deity whom eye cannot see, both those spirits were
   lost and there came the sound of joyous hallelujahs from the spirits
   which are before the Throne of God.

   May it be your lot and mine thus to be brought up, for we are thus
   fallen. May it be ours to be thus caught up to the third Heaven, for we
   are thus broken and cast down into the lowest Hell by nature. God give
   us faith in Christ. Faith in Christ--that is the link, the bond, the
   tie. "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." "Lord,
   I believe, help You my unbelief."

                           Ezekiel'S Deserted Infant

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 7, 1862,

   BY REV. C. H. SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "None eye pitied you, to do any of these unto you, to ha ve compassion
   upon you. But you were cast out into the open field to the loathing of
   your person, in the day that you were born. And when I passed by you
   and saw you polluted in your own blood, I said unto you when you were
   in your blood, Live; yes, I said unto you when you were in your blood,
   Live." Ezekiel 16:5, 6.

   Doubtless the Lord here describes the Jewish people when they began to
   multiply in the land of Egypt and were grievously oppressed by Pharaoh.
   Pharaoh had commanded them to cast out the male children that they
   might perish. Hence, the figure of an infant deserted, cast out into
   the open field to perish by wild beasts, by starvation, or exposure,
   was a very apt portrait of the youthful state of Israel, when God
   looked upon her in love, and brought her out of Egypt to set her in a
   goodly land.

   But all the best Divines and expositors concur in the belief that we
   have here also a most extraordinarily apt and significant description
   of the human race by nature, and of the way in which God in Divine
   mercy passes by the sinner when utterly lost and helpless and by the
   power of the Spirit, bids him "Live." At any rate, we intend to
   consider it so this morning.

   Without any preface, for we need none, we shall, first of all, bid you
   look at the misery of man's estate as set before us in the present
   verses. Then, next, we shall search for motives which could urge the
   Lord to have pity upon this miserable one. And then, thirdly, we shall
   pause a little while to listen to the Divine mandate by which this
   unhappy being is delivered from his lost estate. "I said unto you,
   Live; yes, I said unto you, Live."

   I. At the outset, I shall direct your contemplations to a survey of THE
   MISERY OF MAN'S ESTATE.

   The verse presents to us an infant exposed to die. All the common
   offices that were necessary for its life and health have been
   forgotten. Its heartless parents have laid it out in the open field,
   having no regard whatever for it. There it lies before our eyes,
   covered with blood, exposed to wild beasts, famishing, ready to perish.
   Among many heathen nations there existed the barbarous custom of
   leaving deformed children to perish in the woods or fields. Among the
   Spartans it was an established regulation to abandon their weaker
   offspring to perish at the foot of Mount Taygetus.

   And in these times there are dark places of the earth which are full of
   this unnatural cruelty. The Jews were certainly free from this sin but
   it was a practice of their near neighbors and therefore well known to
   them. And moreover, the remembrance of Egypt and their great lawgiver
   among the crocodiles of the Nile and all the males murdered by royal
   decree, would make the metaphor very simple to them.

   1. At the very first glance, we remark, here is an early ruin. It is an
   infant. A thousand sorrows that one so young should be so deeply taught
   in misery's school! It is an infant. It has not yet tasted joy, but yet
   it knows pain and sorrow to the fullest. How early are you blasted, O
   sweet flower! How soon are your young dawnings quenched in darkness, O
   rising sun! A ruin so terrible and so early has fallen upon each of us.
   Let proud man kick against the doctrine as he may, Scripture tells us
   assuredly that we are "born in sin and shapen in iniquity."

   We came not into this world as Adam came into the garden, without flaw,
   without condemnation, without evil propensities. But lo, by one man's
   offense we are all made sinners and through his desperate fall our
   blood is tainted and our nature is corrupt. From the very birth we go
   astray, speaking lies and in the very birth we lie under the
   condemnation of the Law of God. It is not mine to defend this doctrine,
   to answer objections to it, or to bring arguments for it. I simply
   announce what God has Himself revealed by the mouth of His servant
   David and also more fully by the tongue of the Apostle Paul.

   Man, unless God has mercy on you, you are lost and lost from your very
   beginning! You did not come into this world as one who might stand or
   fall, you were fallen already. An original and birth-sin had seized
   upon you in the womb, and you were even then as an infant cast out to
   perish and to die. There is hardly any doctrine more humbling than that
   of natural depravity or original sin. It has been the main point of
   attack for all those who hate the Gospel. And it must be maintained and
   valiantly vindicated by those who would exalt Christ, since the
   greatness and glory of His salvation lies mainly in the desperateness
   of the ruin from which He has redeemed us.

   Man, think not to save yourself by your works. Boast not of the
   excellence of your character and of your nature. You are a traitor's
   son, you are a felon's child! An act of dishonor was passed upon your
   father's house and you were born under the Law and under the
   curse--obnoxious to Divine Wrath in the very moment when your first
   breath was drawn. Sad heritage of sin! Miserable estate of sorrow! How
   deep the ruin of the Fall! Oh, to Divine Grace what debtors we are,
   that out of this ruin it can lift us up to heights of glory!

   2. The next very apparent teaching of the text is utter inability. It
   is an infant--what can it do for itself? If it were a child of some few
   years it might be able, with tottering feet, to find its way to some
   shelter. If it had the gift of articulate speech, it might sob out its
   wants and tell to the passerby what it needed. But it is an infant--it
   cannot speak. It knows sin but it has not mind enough to know why the
   pain is there. It is ignorant, and although conscious of its ills, its
   untutored, undeveloped intellect can neither describe the evil, nor
   prescribe the remedy.

   Though it may cast its little eyes around, even if help were there, it
   were not in its power to avail itself of the offered aid. It is
   impotent, helpless, utterly powerless. If anything is to be done for
   it, it must all be done by another's hand. Not even clay on the
   potter's wheel is more helpless than this infant as it now lies cast
   out in the open field. Such is human nature. It can by no means help
   towards its own restoration. "Dead," says our Apostle, "dead in
   trespasses and sins," and what shall the dead in their graves do
   towards resurrection? Shall the worm become mother of life, or shall
   corruption be the father of immortality?

   No, trumpet of God, there is no life in the dull, cold ear of death and
   no hearing in the hollow skull of the skeleton. If the graves open, a
   Divine hand must break the seal, heave up the mold and uplift the
   moldering corpse. If there is resurrection, it must come from God and
   from God alone. It must be a miracle in the beginning and a miracle
   even to the end. My Hearers, I am not the author of this doctrine, but
   simply the declarer of what God reveals. You are so lost that you
   cannot by the most desperate efforts of your own save yourselves!
   No--worse--so lost that by nature you have no wish to be saved and will
   not make the efforts or desire to make them.

   You hate God. It is a cutting accusation, but it is true, and may God
   the Holy Spirit make you feel its truth. Naturally, I say, you hate the
   Lord. By nature you love vanity and not God's Truth. You love sin and
   do not wish to be delivered from it. Holiness you choose not--God's
   commandments you abhor. Your nature has become so evil that the
   Ethiopian may sooner change his skin and the leopard his spots, than
   you of yourself learn to do well.

   But, mark you--and this is a thought that may crush our boasts and make
   us hang our heads like a bulrush evermore--this inability is our own
   sin. This is laid at our door--not as an excuse for our sinfulness but
   as a frightful aggravation of our guilt--that we have become so bad
   that we cannot make ourselves good. Our nature is now so desperately
   evil, both by its native depravity, and by our continual practice of
   sin, that iniquity has become our nature. It is as natural to us to sin
   as for water to descend, or sparks to fly upward--

   "Where vice has held its empire long, It will not endure the least
   control. None but a power divinely strong Can turn the current of the
   soul." You cannot, Souls, you cannot save yourselves. You are as
   helpless as the infant cast out. Your inability is utter and entire.

   3. Apparent, too, is yet a third misfortune--we are utterly friendless.
   "None eye pitied you to do any of these things unto you." We have no
   friend in Heaven or in earth that can do anything for us, unless God
   shall interpose. Grant you that a tender parent may pity, but no parent
   can change his child's nature or cleanse away the sin of his offspring.
   Let it be granted that there are ministers of Christ whose tearful eyes
   would woo you to Christ, but the most earnest Evangelist cannot quicken
   your soul.

   The most thundering of all God's Boanerges cannot awake the dead. Let
   it be considered that angels are anxious for your conversion, that were
   you saved they would clap their wings with joy and make glad holiday in
   Heaven. But an angel's power cannot snatch you from the grave of your
   sin, nor could the whole host of seraphs, with their kindred cherubs
   combined, do anything to deliver you from the ruin into which by Adam's
   sin and your own, you have been brought. Your kinsfolk may weep and
   lament for you, but no lamentation can make an atonement for your sin,
   no human tears can cleanse your filthiness, no Christian zeal can
   clothe you with righteousness, no yearning love can sanctify your
   nature.

   Friendless, helpless and ruined from our earliest state--good God, what
   creatures are men! Sinai thunders at us. The Law condemns us. Justice
   bares its sword. Holiness is incensed and truth is sworn to destroy.
   Where, where shall we fly, if You refuse us, O God!

   4. Furthermore, our text very clearly reveals to us that we are by
   nature in a sad state of exposure. Cast out into the open field, left
   in a wilderness where it is not likely that any should pass by, thrown
   where the cold can smite by night and the heat can blast by day, left
   where the wild beast goes about, seeking whom he may devour--such is
   the estate of human nature--unclothed, unarmed, helpless, exposed to
   all manner of ravenous destroyers. Little do any of us know how exposed
   by nature we are to sloth, to drunkenness, to lust, and pride and
   unbelief--to all those young lions which hunt in company with the great
   lion of the pit who seeks whom he may devour.

   Lord God, You alone know the awful dangers which prowl around an
   unregenerate man. What mischiefs waylay him! What crimes beset him!
   What follies haunt him! As God only knows the fullness of the guilt of
   even one sin, so His infinite mind, alone, can grasp the number of
   those tremendous temptations which are planted like snares of death in
   the path of an unconverted soul. Death is after you, O you helpless
   one! Hell yawns for you, sin longs to devour you! Friend, you have none
   but foes and they are many. Armed and mighty are those who would
   destroy you, and you have no power nor will to resist them. You are as
   a helpless infant in a tiger's jaws. Fascinated by the serpent eyes of
   sin, you are paralyzed by its witcheries and so rendered an easy prey
   for the Destroyer.

   5. It seems that this child, besides being in this exposed state, was
   loathsome. "You were cast out to the loathing of your person." It was
   in such a condition that the sight of it was disgusting and its person
   was so destitute of all comeliness that it was absolutely loathed. Such
   is man by nature, but he will not believe it. He still flatters himself
   that he is comely as the curtains of Solomon, while he is black as the
   tents of Kedar. We think ourselves angels, when we are nearest akin to
   devils. But when we get akin to angels, then we mourn the devil that
   still is within us.

   1 know this, that when God the Holy Spirit gives a man a view of
   himself, he is utterly loathsome in his own esteem. One of the
   cardinals of the olden times--when cardinals were sometimes
   saints--happened to pass by a meadow where he saw a shepherd leaning on
   his crook, weeping. He stopped to ask the lad what made him weep. The
   lad replied by pointing to the ground, for just at his feet there was a
   toad. I was weeping," said he, "to think that God should have made me,
   a creature so infinitely superior to this loathsome reptile at my feet,
   and that I should have made myself such a creature that this loathsome
   thing is superior to me, because it has never sinned."

   As the cardinal went his way, he said, "Verily, has it happened, that
   the foolish and unlearned enter into the kingdom of Heaven before us,
   for this peasant has found out the Truth of God." Vipers nor toads are
   more venomous or more loathsome to men than man must be to God, or
   would be to himself if he could see himself with the eyes of truth and
   if the veil of pride were once lifted from his eyes. The image of God
   in man is all obliterated. We have ashes for beauty, shame for glory,
   rottenness for health and Hell for Heaven.

   6. We close this fearful description by observing the certain ruin to
   which this infant was exposed, as setting forth the sure destruction of
   every man if Divine Grace prevent not. It is not a question whether man
   will be lost or not. As to whether man shall enter into the flames of
   Hell or not, is no query--man MUST perish unless God saves. Every one
   of us must be lost to all eternity, unless the strong arm of the Divine
   One interferes. There is no one else to nurture this helpless infant.
   This infant cannot rescue itself. Lost, lost, lost! Howl its requiem,
   you lost ones who have gone before, for help or hope there is none,
   unless the Eternal One shall interpose.

   I would, dear Hearers, that this strong language, as you may think it,
   might be felt to be pertinent to your own case, if you are unconverted.
   I am not selecting special characters and impeaching certain offenders
   who have been outrageously wicked. I am not now describing only the
   harlot, or the burglar, or the murderer--I am speaking of everyone of
   you by nature, of everyone of you who have not been born again. This is
   not complimentary language but it ill becomes God's minister to
   compliment any man. We must tell you plainly the Truth of God.

   You may have been moral, sober, generous, honest--philanthropy may have
   been as the air you breathe. There may be many good traits in your
   character that render you amiable to your relatives and friends--but by
   nature you are not one whit better than the vilest of the vile. And
   were your nature permitted to show itself in all its foulness, the
   black fountain is in your heart as much as in those who are banished
   from their country for their country's good. It is only Providence, or
   the check of society, that keeps it under. You are as much lost and
   ruined as they.

   I know I address many of you who have never fled to Christ for refuge
   but are on very good terms with yourselves, because in comparison with
   others, your character is blameless. Let me entreat you by the living
   God that searches all hearts, to look at yourselves, this morning, in
   your fallen state. If you live and die as you now are, there can be
   nothing for your portion but the flames of Hell. God grant that you may
   be snatched from so terrible a doom. But I see not how this can be
   unless first you are led to see that you deserve this doom and are made
   to tremble at the evil of sin and the wrath of the Lord.

   No doubt, Noah, when he told men they would all be drowned unless they
   fled to the ark, was thought to be very uncharitable. But it was the
   true charity which made him warn them. You must perish unless you find
   shelter in Jesus Christ. Your state is so terrible and damnable, that
   lost you must be unless you fly to God's plan of salvation which He has
   laid down for lost, ruined, helpless sinners. "Micaiah, spoke not good
   but evil," said the king, but he learned afterwards that Micaiah's
   hardness and boldness came of God, while the smooth things of the false
   Prophets came from the devil. I do again, then, beseech and entreat you
   to lay these things to heart.

   Ruined Souls, you are self-destroyed, ready to perish, without help,
   without power! You are cast out and exposed to evils of which you, as
   yet, are not aware but certain ultimately to make your bed in Hell
   unless God delivers you. Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of
   God, that He may exalt you in due time. Confess your sins before Him
   with broken hearts, weep before Him the tears of penitence, and He can,
   yes, He will deliver and bring up His chosen from the depths of
   destruction and His elect ones from the jaws of Hell. Thus mournfully
   have we rehearsed the story of human ruin. Let us bless God that we do
   not end here.

   II. We are now to search for MOTIVES FOR GOD'S GRACE. Brethren, we have
   a very difficult search before us when we look to this infant which is
   cast out. Its loathsomeness and its being covered with its own blood
   forbid us at once to hope that there can be anything in it which can
   merit the esteem of the Merciful One. Let us think of some of the
   motives which may urge men to assist the undeserving.

   1. One of the first would be, necessity. Some men, I do not doubt, are
   generous from necessity. That is to say they feel it necessary to
   maintain their reputation, and therefore they are generous before men.
   Or they gain so much self-esteem--and there is a necessity in man's
   nature to make him seek after that--that they are willing to be kind
   that they may be approved within. Not a few are placed in such a
   position that they could not well refuse to give their help when it is
   asked of them. But no necessity can ever effect the Most High. The
   first of all causes must be absolutely independent of every other
   cause. He acts voluntarily. It belongs to God to say absolutely, "I
   will."

   Man may say, "I will," but it must always be with bated breath, for the
   sovereign fiat of God may contradict him. But God is under no
   necessity. Has He a superior? Who is king over Him? Who dictates
   counsel to the Most High? Who sits at His bar and gives Him advice and
   warning and makes Him do according to his pleasure? Nor had God any
   necessity in order to make Himself happy or to increase His glory. The
   praises of angels were enough for Him. No, even the praise of angels is
   as nothing in His awful sight. His joy is in Himself.

   He finds within His own infinite essence a sufficiency of delight. He
   needs go abroad for nothing, for He fills all things and He is All in
   All. If it had been God's will to leave the human race to perish, He
   might have done it, and there was none to say to Him, "What are You
   doing?" And when He does save man, it is not because there is any
   compul-sion--either moral, physical, or spiritual upon Him. He has done
   as He wills in this great matter of the redemption and salvation of
   men. O Soul, God is not bound to save you! Man, you are lost and there
   is nothing that can compel the Almighty to deliver you! If He does it,
   it must be according to His own good pleasure, to the praise of the
   glory of His Grace.

   2. In this case, there was nothing in the birth of this child, in its
   original parentage, that could move the passerby. We are told in some
   former verses, "your birth and your nativity is of the land of Canaan;
   your father was an Amorite and your mother an Hittite," both of them
   belonging to an accursed race. Look unto the hole of the pit from where
   you are dug. There was nothing in your birth or mine why He should have
   pity on us. Kings, princes, mighty men boast much of their pedigrees,
   but the Lord knows nothing of the glory of these family trees and
   ancestries. No, rather, He leaves the mighty man in the dust, cutting
   down the high tree, that He may cause the low tree to flourish.

   He pours contempt upon princes and knows no respect of persons. All
   spring from the common race of man, and what is there in our corrupt
   nature, what is there in us to move the heart of God? Nothing,
   absolutely nothing. Young man, it is not because your father was godly,
   that God should be constrained to save you. It is not because your
   mother was a lady of rank, that the Almighty should stretch out His arm
   to you. You were conceived in sin, and stained in your very birth.
   There is, therefore, nothing here that could move the heart of deity.

   3. Nor was there anything in this child's beauty, for it was loathsome.
   Men are often affected by beauty. Doubtless Pharaoh's daughter
   preserved Moses because he was a comely child. We know that Ahasuerus
   chose Esther because of her beauty. And there have been many that have
   been exalted in the world for their personal attractions. But it was
   not so with man in God's sight. "The whole head is sick and the whole
   heart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no
   soundness in it; but wounds and bruises and putrefying sores."

   We are not only sinners, but sin itself. How then can sin attract the
   regard and love of a perfectly holy God? There may be much in us that
   can make our fellow creatures esteem us--there can be nothing in us as
   fallen, condemned, un-godly--that can make God esteem us. I know that
   you who are spiritually taught, will join with me in singing--

   "What was there in us to merit esteem,
   Or give the Creator delight?
   It was even so, Father, we ever must sing,
   For so it seemed good in Your sight."

   See then, Sinner, you are without form or comeliness, and you have no
   beauty that He should desire you. What can there be in a worm to
   gratify the Almighty? The heavens are not pure in His sight and He
   charged His angels with folly. How much less, then, should there be any
   beauty in man, that is but a worm, or in the son of man, that is
   crushed before the moth? Think not that He needs your beauty to excite
   His love. He can love you though deformed, and love you till He has
   made you comely by His comeliness, which He shall put upon you.

   4. Furthermore, as we have found no motive yet, either in necessity or
   the child's birth or beauty, so we find none in any entreaties that
   were uttered by this child. It does not seem that it pleaded with the
   passerby to save it, for it could not as yet speak. So, though sinners
   do pray, yet when a sinner prays, it is because God has begun to save
   him. A sinner's prayers can never be the cause of his salvation, for,
   mark you, the Truth of God is that no man ever seeks God first--God has
   first sought him and began a good work in his soul, before he ever
   turns to God.

   In some cases, this is very extraordinarily proved. The old writers
   used to quote the instance of a man who went into a wood, having been
   an outrageous sinner, with the determination of destroying himself.
   While he adjusted the rope, some passerby, hearing a sound, came and
   expostulated with him and the words were blessed to his salvation. Is
   there any preparation or preparatory process in a man who has come to
   such a pitch of sin, that he is about to take away his own life, to
   wash his hands in his own blood? Surely this was Divine Grace.

   There were one or two cases in Whitfield's history, of men who came
   into places where he was preaching, with stones in their pockets to
   pelt him with but who became themselves converted. Was there anything
   there for the Grace of God to get a hold of, anything to foster, to
   favor, to nourish the Grace, the Sovereign Grace of the Most High? No,
   rather, while they were yet without anything whatever that could have
   cried after God, He was found of them that sought Him not. He called
   them a people that were not a people, and her Beloved that was not
   Beloved.

   I know some think that the sinner takes the first step but we know
   better. If he did, it were like the old Romish miracle of St. Dennis,
   where we are told that after his head was cut off, he picked it up and
   walked two thousand miles with it in his hand! Whereupon, some wit
   observed that he did not see any wonder in the man's walking two
   thousand miles-- for all the difficulty lay in the first step. Just so,
   I see no difficulty in a man's getting all the way to Heaven, if he can
   but take the first step. For all the miracle lies in that first step,
   the making the dead soul live, the melting of the adamantine heart, the
   thawing of the northern ice, the bringing down of the proud look. This
   is the work, this is the difficulty. And if man can do that himself,
   verily, he can do the whole work.

   But when God looks upon men to save them, it is not because they cry to
   Him, for they never do and never will cry until the work of salvation
   is begun. They are unwilling and unable to use any entreaty or
   persuasion that could be cogent to the heart of God. Rather, they abhor
   the mercy. They run away from the Divine Grace which is offered to
   them. They reject the Gospel when it is preached. They will not come to
   Christ that they may have life, but they willfully and wickedly turn
   their backs upon the Most High. Until He by His strong hand brings them
   to Christ, saved they will never be. O Divine Grace, O Divine Grace,
   how wide Your sphere! How glorious are You in meeting the degradation
   and the sin of man! You show the splendor of Your power in beginning,
   carrying on, and finishing the work.

   5. Yet, further, Brethren--it does not appear that the pity of the
   passerby was shown upon this child because of any future service which
   was expected of it. This child, it seems, was nourished, clothed,
   luxuriously decorated, and yet, after all that, if you read the chapter
   through, you will find it went astray from Him who had set His heart
   upon it. The Lord foresaw this and yet loved that child
   notwithstanding. God knew that you and I, though He loved us when there
   was nothing good in us, after we were saved should still rebel. He knew
   that we had backsliding hearts. He knew that we should be unbelieving
   even to the end--but He loved us notwithstanding all this.

   He did not love you because He foresaw you would be a preacher. Nor you
   because He knew you would be a tract distributor. Nor you because He
   knew that you would be an indefatigable Sunday school teacher. He loved
   you although He knew that you would be as you are today, ungrateful and
   unkind to Him--cold in your soul, worldly in your spirit. You can
   today, rehearse experimentally, our last Sunday's text, "I was as a
   beast before you: nevertheless I am continually with you."

   There was, then, no motive of future service why this child should be
   blessed, or why God should save man. I do not know--I want to say what
   I cannot say this morning. I want to exhibit to you man, standing as a
   criminal at the bar, guilty, proved to be guilty even to his very face,
   yet proudly saying that he is not guilty. A traitor at heart, a base
   rebel, an ungrateful wretch! I want you to think of him as one upon
   whom pity seems as if it would be thrown away--not an object for mercy.
   One of whom the universe cries, "Away with him, away with him, it is
   not fit that he should live!"

   And then, I want to show you God in the sovereignty of His Divine
   Grace, saying, "I will spare that traitor. He deserves to die but I
   will spare him. I have no motive for it, except such as is in My own
   will. There is nothing in him, no reason in him why I should spare him,
   but I will spare him. I will prove that I am king forever and ever and
   the God and Lord of mercy. The only answer that we can give to the
   question, "Why then, does God spare this outcast infant?" is this, "I
   will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on
   whom I will have compassion. So then it is not of him that wills, nor
   of him that runs but of God that shows mercy."

   How is Jehovah exalted in our midst this morning! My spirit trembles
   while it labors to exalt the Lord alone. The Lord is King forever and
   ever, hallelujah! Bow your heads, both Saints and Sinners, and adore
   Him as King of kings and Lord of lords. Ask not questions, for He gives
   no account of His matters. Quarrel not with His dominion, for His
   answer is to you, "No but, O Man, who are you that reply against God?
   Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why have You made me
   thus?" Impeach not His justice, or His justice you shall feel in
   smiting you. Entreat His mercy, but entreat it as those that have no
   claim upon Him. Ask Him for it as knowing that if he gives it to you He
   has a right to give it or to withhold it if He will.

   Sinners, behold yourselves this morning, in the hand of an angry God.
   There you lie before God, like a moth beneath your own fingers. It is
   as He wills--to save or to destroy you. Are you at ease? Will you mock
   Him? Will you boast and glorify yourselves? Rather, as creatures that
   are now absolutely under His control and deservedly subject to His rod,
   bow your heads and cry, "God, be merciful to us, sinners! You can save,
   do it for Your own will and glory's sake, that Your mercy may be
   magnified and Your sovereignty may be clearly seen."

   We have found no motive in the creature, and therefore, we refrain from
   further search, believing that the fountain and wellspring of mercy is
   in God Himself. Into His reasons we cannot search, lest like Job, we
   should hear the rebuke of the Lord, "Have you entered into the springs
   of the sea? Or have you walked in search of the depth?" III. But now,
   we turn to consider THE MANDATE OF HIS MERCY. "I said unto you, Live."

   First, I want you to notice that this fiat of God is majestic. "I said
   unto you when you were in your blood, Live; yes, I said unto you when
   you were in your blood, Live." Darkness was upon the face of the earth
   and thus the Almighty spoke, "Let there be light!" And light was.
   Sublime because simple. Without any oratorical embellishments,
   magnificently stern--God speaks and it is done. So, in our text, we
   perceive a sinner with nothing in him but sin, expecting nothing but
   wrath. But the Majestic One passes by--He is making a tour of His
   dominions, splendidly arrayed, with ten thousand times ten thousand
   angels at His beck and call.

   He looks, and there lies an infant, loathsome, in its blood. He stops
   and He pronounces the word, the royal word, "Live." There speaks a God.
   Who but He could venture thus to deal with life and dispense it with a
   single syllable? It is majestic, it is Divine! And mark you, Brothers
   and Sisters, though the word preached by us may be very rough and
   rug-ged--as we confess to you it is--though we know but little of the
   graces of oratory, yet when God speaks by a minister, there is nothing
   more Divine under Heaven, nor in Heaven, than the Gospel. When the Lord
   speaks, even though it is by the unlettered and the ignorant, when
   through the Gospel He says, "Live," to a sinner--not even the angels
   who bow before the Throne of God ever heard a more Divine sound. Thus
   says the Lord, you dead sinner, "Live!"

   Again, this fiat is manifold as well as majestic. When He says, "Live,"
   it includes many things. Here is judicial life. The sinner is ready to
   be condemned and executed--his neck is on the block and the axe is
   gleaming in the sunlight--but the Mighty One says, "Live," and he rises
   pardoned and absolved. The execution is not only stayed, that were but
   res-pite--the crime is forgiven--the man is to live for years!

   It is, moreover, spiritual life. The man knew nothing of God, his eyes
   could not see Christ, his ears could not hear His voice. Jehovah said,
   "Live," and spiritual life was given and we were quickened who were
   dead in trespasses and sins. Moreover, it includes glory-life, which is
   the perfection of spiritual life. "I said unto you, Live." And that
   word rolls on through all the years of life till death comes, and in
   the midst of the shadows of death, the Lord's voice is still heard, "I
   say unto you, Live!" In the morning of the resurrection it is that same
   voice which is echoed by the archangel, "Live," and as the spirits rise
   to Heaven to be blessed forever in the glory of their God, it is in the
   power of this same voice, "I say unto you, Live."

   Note again, that it is an irresistible voice. When God says to a
   sinner, "Live," all the devils in Hell cannot keep him in the grave. If
   the Lord should say to a blasphemer here today, "Live," that blasphemer
   must become a saint. Saul of Tarsus is on the road to Damascus to
   arrest the saints of the living God. A strong hand might seize the
   bridle of his charger and throw him to the ground. But Saul is not to
   be stopped like that. He will rise from the ground the same Saul, to go
   to Damascus as blood-thirsty as ever. But see what Divine Grace can do!
   A voice from Heaven and a light brighter than the brightness of the sun
   and Saul is crying out, "Lord, what will You have me to do?" Within
   three days he is baptized. He becomes a preacher. And Saul that was
   called Paul becomes a leader in the hosts of the Most High. My Master
   can do the same today. Mighty to save is He--

   "Tell what His arm has done, What spoils from death He won, Praise His
   dear name alone. Worthy the Lamb."

   We remark again, that it is all-sufficient. "Live," do you say, great
   God? Why, the man is dead! There is no life in him, but in the Voice
   that bids him live. "Live," do you say? "By this time he stinks, for he
   has been dead four days!" There is power--not in his corruption but in
   the Voice that cries, "Come forth!" When we preach to sinners and tell
   them to believe in Christ, do not fancy it is because we think we have
   any power. No, but because when in God's name we say, "Believe," the
   power is in the mandate as it comes from our lips, uttered by the Most
   High. If a minister is not filled with God's Spirit, then His ministry
   is an empty dream. But if a minister is, as I conceive him to be, a man
   who speaks in God's name, and for the time being is the very mouth of
   God to men's soul's, then there is power in the Gospel as it is
   preached, attended with the demonstration of the Spirit, to do for the
   sinner what he can by no means do for himself.

   I cry today in my Master's name "Thus says the Lord, believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ and you shall live." Trust my Master bleeding on the
   tree and you shall be delivered. Rest on the merit of His blood and of
   His glorious righteousness! Trust in the power of His intercession
   before the Throne, and despite your lost estate, you shall be this
   morning saved forever and ever!

   We close when we shall have repeated ourselves once more by
   saying--this mandate was a mandate of Free Grace. I want to lay that
   down again, and again, and again--that there was nothing in this
   infant, nothing but loathsomeness, nothing therefore, to merit esteem.
   Nothing in the infant but inability. Nothing therefore, by which it
   could help itself. Nothing in it but infancy. Nothing therefore, by
   which it could plead for itself and yet Divine Grace said, "Live"--
   freely, without any bribe, without any entreaty, said--"Live." And so
   when sinners are saved, it is only and solely because God Wills to do
   it, to magnify His free, unpurchased, unsought Divine Grace.

   Surely this is a subject which will suit some here, though it will not
   please others. Proud Pharisees will turn on their heels. "That is very
   high Calvinistic doctrine," says one. My dear Friends, I do not care
   what it is. I know it is written in the Word of God. I preach very
   often sermons which get me the title of Arminian and just as often I am
   charged with Hy-perism. I am simply one who seeks honestly to tell you
   what he believes to be in Scripture and what he believes to be true.
   And therefore, whether it IS high or low is nothing to me. Is it true?
   I know the proud Pharisee will say, "No." "Why," says he, "there must
   be some merit in what we do! Surely we do something! Perseverance in
   well-doing and so on, surely this will effect much?"

   You are under the Law and not under Grace. You have not yet learned the
   A B C of the Gospel. You want to be a saint by the merit of what you
   do, and you will be lost as sure as you are a man unless you look at
   things in a different light. But I know that the doctrine will be
   acceptable to those condemned ones here this morning, who have written
   their own sentence out, who say, "I must perish, I have nothing to
   bring you, O Lord. I have not even a tender heart, I have not even such
   a sense of need as I want. Lord, I am empty, except that I am full of
   evil and full of sin, I have nothing that I could put before Your eyes,
   except that which would excite Your wrath and Your disgust. Great God,
   if You should not save me I cannot blame You. I lay hold of nothing in
   myself. But You have said, 'He that believes on the Lord Jesus Christ,
   has everlasting life.' Lord, I venture to believe on Him. You will be
   true, You will save even me."

   Soul, Soul, you may go out of this house light of heart and foot, for
   "your sins, which are many, are forgiven you!" In God's name I
   pronounce the sentence of absolution on you, if you have thus come to
   Christ and trusted in the Lord Jesus. There is not a sentence left in
   God's Book against you. By His Grace, you are no more dead but you
   live--no more accursed but beloved. You are no more loathsome but
   beautiful--covered with Christ's righteousness and filled with the
   Spirit of the living God.

   What shall I say to you who are Christians but this--for the sake of
   this Divine Grace--show your gratitude--live more like your Master and
   live more in God's service. Seek to spend and be spent in Him. Nothing
   can make a man work for Christ like Free Grace. And those who believe
   the doctrine of Free Grace and yet are idle, you must surely hold the
   Truth of God in unrighteousness, for there is no principle so active,
   so impulsive as this--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again
   With love intense I'd burn.
   Chosen of You before time began,
   I'd choose You in return."

   Finally, Christian, never give up any sinner. Never think that any man
   is beyond salvation. I charge you by the solemn thought that God looks
   for nothing in man, and saves only according to the sweet counsels of
   His own will, bring every man you meet with before God in prayer, plead
   with every man, preach Christ to every man, tell every man that Christ
   can save, tell that sinner that whatever there is not in him, Christ's
   power is still the same, that His arm is not shortened, neither is His
   ear heavy. And spread the glad news that it is not of the will of man,
   nor of his blood, nor birth--but by the power of the Spirit of God
   according to the will of the Most High--that men are saved. May the
   Lord add His blessing and do some of His mighty works this morning
   through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

                            Accepted In The Beloved

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 21, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.
   "He has made us accepted in the Beloved." Ephesians 1:6.
   "THE Beloved!" This was a golden name which the ancient Church in her
   most joyous moments was likely to give to the Anointed of the Lord.
   When the time of the singing of birds was come, and the voice of the
   turtle was heard in her land, her love note was sweeter than either
   bird or turtle, as she sung, "My Beloved is mine and I am His. He feeds
   among the lilies." Ever in her song of songs does she call Him by that
   delightful name, "My Beloved!"

   Even in the long winter when idolatry had withered the garden of the
   Lord, her Prophets found space to cease from uttering the thunders of
   judgment, to lay aside the burden of the Lord for a little season and
   to say, as Isaiah did, "Now will I sing to my Well-Beloved a song of my
   Beloved touching His vineyard." Though the saints had never seen His
   face, though as yet He was not made flesh, nor had dwelt among us, nor
   had man beheld His glory--the glory as of the only Begotten of the
   Father, full of Divine Grace and truth, yet He was the consolation of
   Israel, the hope and joy of all the chosen, the Beloved of all those
   who were upright before the Most High.

   Brethren, in the summer days of the Church, let us not fail to call
   Christ our Beloved. Both in our prayers, and public songs, and in those
   nearer and dearer approaches which we make to Him in private--when we
   may use more tender epithets than we would venture to do in a mixed
   assembly, we are likely to speak of Christ as the best Beloved of our
   soul--and to feel that He is to us very precious, the "chief among ten
   thousand and the altogether lovely."

   So true is it that the Church loves Christ, and claims Him as her
   Beloved, that the Apostle dares to defy the whole universe to separate
   her from the love of Christ, and declares that neither persecutions,
   distress, affliction, peril, or the sword, have been able to do it. No,
   he joyously boasts, "In all these things we are more than conquerors
   through Him that has loved us." And he concludes his bold utterance by
   declaring that he is persuaded that "neither death, nor life, nor
   angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things
   to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able
   to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
   Lord."

   We think we should not be trespassing into the realms of imagination if
   we ventured to say that Christ is also the Beloved of the angels. To
   Him cherubim and seraphim continually cry. For in that thrice-repeated
   strain, there is a word for the second Person of the Trinity, as well
   as for the first and the third--"Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
   Sabaoth." And, certainly, the blood-bought call Him their Beloved, for
   their incessant strain is, "Unto Him that loved us and washed us from
   our sins in His blood, unto Him be glory forever and ever."

   Yet, my dear Friends, the main reason why Christ is thus styled by the
   Holy Spirit, "the Beloved," doubtless is because He is the Beloved of
   the Father's heart. "This," said the mysterious voice from Heaven in
   the midst of the waters of Jordan, "this is my Beloved Son in whom I am
   well-pleased." And again, at the resurrection of Lazarus, there came
   the same voice from Heaven, announcing the perpetuity of the Father's
   love. None of us can tell how dear Jesus must be to His Father. We
   have, however, abundant proofs of the fact that He is very near unto
   Him, for He is privy to all His Father's counsels.

   From the counsels of the Most High, Christ was never absent. "When
   there were no depths, I was brought forth. When there were no fountains
   abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the
   hills, was I brought forth. While as yet He had not made the earth, nor
   the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. When He
   prepared the heavens, I was there. When he set a compass upon the face
   of the depth. When He established the clouds above. When He
   strengthened the fountains of the deep. When He gave to the sea His
   decree, that the waters should not pass His command. When He appointed
   the foundations of the earth, then I was by Him, as one brought up with
   Him. And I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him."

   "Let us make man," said God. "in Our own image"--calling Christ into
   creation's work. "Without Him was not anything made that was made," is
   the declaration of John the Divine. Beside this, we know that
   everything which is done of the Father by His Divine decree is that He
   may glorify His Son. While, on the other hand, the Son lived and died,
   and lives again that He may glorify the Father. Such is their mutual
   interest in one another, that we cannot suppose a relationship closer,
   nor a love more intense than that which exists between the Father and
   the Son. It were foolish and ridiculous in me to attempt to dive into
   the awful depths of the Divine unity. We know that the Father is One
   with the Son, and that Jesus is one with Jehovah.

   The Unity of Essence is a well so deep, that I cannot expect to find
   its bottom. And the love which springs up from this essential Unity
   must be more deep and profound than the wit of man can guess, or than
   the language of man can utter. I repeat the confession of our
   ignorance--it is impossible for us to form even a guess of the
   intensity of the affection that must exist between the eternal Father
   and Jesus Christ, His Son--since their essential Union from which this
   affection springs is a doctrine beyond our comprehension--and is meekly
   to be received of our faith. Certainly we know that never was the term,
   "Beloved," so full of meaning. Never did human word become so Divinely
   rich as when God Himself, by the Holy Spirit, applied it to Jesus the
   Beloved of the Father.

   No more, however, concerning this word, "the Beloved," except that I
   trust there are many of us here who can thus salute our Covenant Head.
   Yes, He is very dear to us. We love Him because He first loved us. The
   love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit and it has
   kindled in our poor souls a flame undying, which neither life nor death
   shall quench, but which shall burn brighter and brighter till it
   consumes flesh and self, and we shall be all on flame with love to
   Christ.

   Now, dear Friends, having thus brought forward the title of Christ, I
   shall, in dependence upon the Eternal Spirit, call your attention,
   first of all, to the words, "in the Beloved," or "positive union."
   Secondly, to the words "accepted in the Beloved," or glorious
   condition. And then to the whole text, "He has made us accepted in the
   Beloved," or Divine operation.

   I. First then, here is a matter most worthy of your best and most
   profound thoughts--"IN THE BELOVED," or, POSITIVE UNION.

   A thousand sermons would never exhaust the theme of the union of the
   Church with Christ. No theology is sound which does not recognize this.
   No experience can be very profound which does not lead the soul more
   clearly and more fully to rejoice in this most glorious Truth of God.
   Probably it is a doctrine more suitable to advanced Christians than to
   young Believers. But where the Lord enables the heart to feed upon it,
   it will be found to be food at once nourishing, delicious, satisfying
   and strengthening. They who feed upon it will be found like Daniel and
   his companions, to be fairer in countenance and fatter in flesh than
   any others.

   1. In explaining this positive union, let us begin by saying, "in
   Christ"--that is, in His heart, and in His heart from all eternity.
   With prescient eye Christ beheld His people before they were yet
   formed. He looked forward through eternity and the rolling years of
   time, and He foresaw that God would make man, and that man in Adam
   would fall and be ruined. His eyes looked over all the sons of Adam,
   and selected those whom He saw fit according to the counsel of His
   will--and these, at once, were put into His heart to be His darlings,
   His favorites forever and ever.

   It was not in time that Christ first wrote the names of His people upon
   His heart--it was a time before all times, when there was no day but
   the Ancient of Days. When creation's first year had not commenced. When
   all things slept in the mind of God as a thought, but had not come
   forth from His hands as a deed. We look upon the rocks with their long
   deposits of sand and shells--we go deeper down and see the long ages
   that must have passed while the stony strata were being formed. We
   wonder at the period that the aqueous and igneous rocks must have
   occupied in their formation. And sometimes we are staggered at the
   thought of what a great thing time is.

   We find we cannot grasp the idea of, "in the beginning God created the
   heavens and the earth." It is so far back that the wings of our
   imagination flag before they reach it as a resting place. But there was
   an eternity before all this. And all these ages are but as the drop of
   a bucket compared with the deep and bottomless sea of the eternity of
   God. Yet, when we fly back into the dread eternity, where thought is
   lost and mind fails, we discover in the breast of Christ eternal
   thoughts of love towards His children. Is it not a joy that can make
   your spirits dance, like David before the ark, that we were always
   Jesus' Beloved ones, always in the heart of Him whose heart was
   afterwards in the fullness of time pierced for us?

   Has He not said, "I have loved you with an everlasting love. Therefore
   with loving kindness have I drawn you"? "As the Father has loved Me,
   even so have I loved you"? That is, without beginning--ever since there
   was a Father and a Christ. It were blasphemy to suppose that God's love
   to Jesus was not always existent, or that Christ had a beginning in the
   Father's affections. Even from that time Jesus had chosen His people
   and they were in His heart. Beloved, as they were in His heart, so they
   have been in His heart ever since. When they fell in Adam they did not
   fall out of Christ. When they lived in this world a life of iniquity,
   yet still there was His great love with which He loved them, even when
   they were dead in trespasses and sins.

   When they scorned His Grace, defied His love, trampled on His Cross,
   and despised His blood, yet still never from His heart were they
   erased, for they had been engraved there too deeply by the nails for
   sin to destroy the remembrance. And now, today, now that we are
   continually backsliding, nothing has been able as yet to tear us from
   His heart. We are there and we shall be there, in death's dark gloom
   and in eternity's mysterious splendor--near to Jesus still, for is it
   not written--"He hates putting away"? "Having loved His own which were
   in the world, He loved them unto the end."

   So, then, Beloved, we are in Christ in the sense that we are in
   Christ's heart, and we always were so if we are His people.

   2. But, secondly, we are also in Christ's Book. Having loved us, we
   were chosen in Him and elected by His Father. We were not chosen
   separately and distinctly and as individuals alone and apart--we were
   chosen in Christ. As Watts well puts it--

   "Christ, is My first elect, He said-Then chose our souls in Christ, our
   Head." By Christ's love we were one with Him. The Father's election
   chose the whole Christ, both the Head, and the members, too. Christ can
   well say, "In Your book all My members were written, which in
   continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them." We all
   know that Christ is elect and precious. God singled out the humanity of
   Christ from many thousands of forms that He might have created. He
   ordained that the Seed of the woman--the Child that was born in
   Bethlehem and laid in the manger--should become the Body and the human
   soul which should be taken into union with Divinity. Here was election.

   And as Christ was thus chosen both in the Divine and Human natures, so
   are all His people chosen--chosen in Him. Blessed fact! The same
   register which includes Christ as first-born, includes all the
   Brethren. And until the flames of Hell can consume the record which
   certifies Christ as a Son of God, our sonship in Christ towards God
   must remain safe from all the attacks of Satanic craft. Disprove
   Christ's Sonship, and you disprove ours. Prove the union of Christ with
   God as His Son and since Christ's people are in Him, you prove their
   sonship, too. Look down the red roll which God wrote with His eternal
   finger, according to the counsel of His will and you see the names of
   all that should enter into eternal life.

   They are all there secure, because the first one is secure. And until
   the pen of Hell can run through the first one in the catalog, it shall
   never be able to run through any of the others--for there stand the
   names of all the elect, covered, protected and defended, by the name of
   Christ, which stands at the head. We are in that Book which is sealed
   with seven seals, which none but the Lion of the tribe of Judah has
   prevailed to open.

   3. Thirdly, we are in Christ's hands. We are in Christ's heart as our
   heavenly Lover. We are in Christ's Book as the Medium of our election.
   We are in Christ's hands as our Surety. You will remember, Beloved,
   that when Laban gave up his flock to Jacob, Jacob took them upon the
   condition of suretyship. Jacob said unto Laban, "That which was torn of
   beasts I brought not unto you. I bore the loss of it. Of my hands did
   you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night." Now, all
   those who the Father gave to Christ were bestowed upon Christ as a
   surety and at the Last Great Day, at the Redeemer's hands will God
   require the souls of all that were given to Him.

   He is the great Shepherd of the sheep, responsible as the Mediator,
   responsible to Him who possesses all. Sponsor for His people, Surety
   for all the chosen, He stands at this hour before the eternal Throne.
   And do you think, Beloved, He will lose us? Never! He has made us the
   choicest objects of His care. Shall His eyes sleep? Shall His heart
   forget? Shall His hands grow weary? Shall He lose the force and
   strength which anciently He possessed? He has sworn by Himself that He
   will bring us safely to the Father--will He be defeated? He has said,
   "I give unto My sheep eternal life; and they shall never perish,
   neither shall any man pluck them out of My hands"

   And shall the infernal lion rend that which He has deigned to keep?
   What? Shall He put His hands upon His people and shelter them there and
   clutch them as the choicest treasure and the rarest jewel that He ever
   had, and shall death or Hell unlock His fingers or wrench His chosen
   from His mighty grasp? Who shall defeat Omnipotence, or pluck the
   sinner from the Almighty grasp? Rejoice, Believers, you are saved just
   because you are in the hands of Christ. I marvel at those who try to
   slip from that text, "None shall pluck them out of My hand," and think
   that souls can be lost after that--for the text does not admit of any
   other meaning than their safety. "They shall never perish," and "I give
   unto them eternal life," are plain, literal, positive statements, which
   none can misunderstand. Happy are the men who are thus in Christ.

   4. But, fourthly, we are in Christ's loins. This may convey a thought
   somewhat different from being in Christ's hands. We were all of us in
   the loins of Adam, and have all sprung from him by natural generation.
   Adam was our Federal Head. All his acts were representative acts. While
   he was obedient, we were obedient in him. Had he continued obedient,
   we, his descendants, should have been partakers of the privileges which
   accrue to obedience. Adam offended. We offended in him. Being the
   inheritors of his nature we have partaken of his original corruption.
   And being moreover in him as our representative, we became partakers of
   his condemnation. In Adam all die. "By the offense of one man,
   condemnation came upon all men."

   As being, then, in the loins of Adam, we fell--and we should have
   fallen into everlasting perdition, if we, as God's chosen, had not been
   also in the loins of Christ. But all the chosen were in the loins of
   Christ from all eternity, so that what was done He did for them. When
   He obeyed the Law, and made it honorable, they are regarded before God
   as having kept the Law, and having honored it in every jot and tittle.
   When He did hang upon the tree, the chosen who were in Him were
   virtually suffering the wrath of God. Justice looks upon the chosen as
   though they themselves had suffered all that Christ suffered, as though
   they had drunk the wormwood and the gall, and had descended into the
   lowest depths.

   When He was buried we were buried with Him. For we are dead with Christ
   unto the world and buried in Baptism with Him unto death. When Christ
   ascended from the tomb we rose in Him. He rose again, not as a private
   individual, but for our justification. Virtually every elect soul rose
   from the eternal death of its deserved perdition in the day when Christ
   startled the keepers and rolled away the stone. And when Christ
   ascended up on High we ascended in Him. Up with Him we entered into the
   spheres. And with Him, today, we are risen in Christ, and made with Him
   to sit in heavenly places, even in Christ Jesus.

   Today, Beloved, the language of the Psalmist is more true than he
   thought concerning man, "You made Him to have dominion over the works
   of Your hands, the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and
   whatever passes through the paths of the seas." We see not all things
   yet put under man on earth. But we see Jesus, who as the representative
   Man sits in Heaven, triumphant over all things, having all things put
   forever under His feet. And representatively under our feet, too, since
   we are in Christ. Just as the Apostle Paul argues concerning Levi, that
   Levi is inferior to Christ, for, he says, Abraham was less than
   Melchisedek, for without doubt the less is blessed of the greater, so
   also Levi was less than Mel-chisedek, for he was in the loins of
   Abraham when Melchisedek met him.

   So Beloved, as Levi was in the loins of Abraham, who paid tithes to
   Melchisedek, so we were in the loins of Christ and paid the debt due to
   Divine justice, gave to the Law its fulfillment, and to wrath its
   satisfaction. In the loins of Christ we have passed through the tomb
   already, and have entered into that which is within the veil and are
   made to sit down in heavenly places, even in Him. This day the chosen
   of God are one with Christ and in the loins of Christ.

   5. As we are in the heart of Christ, in the Book of Christ, in the
   hands of Christ, and in the loins of Christ, there is yet another
   thought dearer and sweeter still. We are in the Person of Christ, for
   we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones. When the
   Spirit of God comes into the sinner and convicts him of sin, that
   sinner is led to look to Christ, only, for his salvation,. Christ then
   becomes unto him the Way and the Life. By the mysterious operations of
   the quickening Spirit, the sinner begins to live a spiritual life.

   Now, in the moment when the spiritual life was first given, there
   commenced in that soul a vital and personal union with the Person of
   Christ Jesus. There had always been in that soul a secret mystical
   union in the Divine purpose. But now there comes to be a union in
   effect and the soul is in Christ from that hour, in a sense in which it
   never was before. Oh, do you understand what it is to be in Christ
   vitally? Beloved, no explanations can set this forth. "The natural man
   discerns not the things which are of the Spirit of God." These are
   things which must be known experimentally by each man for himself.

   Have you felt a life in you that is far superior to the vital principle
   which you inherit from your parent? Have you known that regeneration
   has given you another existence which generation did not confer upon
   you? Have you felt principles alive within which no education could
   have developed, and which no persuasion could have implanted? Have you
   within you the living and incorruptible seed of God, which abides
   forever? Have you been made partakers of the Divine nature, having
   "escaped that corruption which is in the world through lust"?

   Have you been begotten again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of
   Jesus Christ from the dead? If so, the life in you is Christ in you,
   the hope of Glory. And your life is sustained by the fact that you are
   one with Christ. Suck the nourishment of your life from Him just as the
   branch draws from the trunk the sap whereby it is invigorated and made
   to live--

   "I can do nothing without You, My strength is wholly Yours.
   Withered and barren should I be If severed from the vine"

   I trust, Brethren, that we are in union with Christ, not in theory, but
   in fact--not as a matter of doctrine, but as a matter of experience,
   till we can say, "Christ is in me and I am in Him. The life that I live
   in the flesh is no more I, but Christ that lives in me." "In the
   Beloved," then, is a thought which is not very easy for us to bring out
   in so short a space of time.

   Now, I want to put you to the test this morning, by appealing to you
   all whether you know anything about this. A great many will say, "Well,
   it is a very odd thing, we do not understand it." Take heed to
   yourselves, then. Deal honestly with your spirits. Inasmuch as you do
   not know what it is to be in Christ, then you are without Christ. And
   then you are without hope, and there remains nothing for you but a
   fearful looking for judgment and of fiery indignation. No man out of
   Christ can be saved. In Christ the branch lives. But divided from
   Christ, men gather up the useless branches and cast them into the fire
   and they are burned.

   Come, now, I want to try you. The first question I ask you, to
   ascertain whether you are in Christ, is this--Is He all your
   dependence? For the union of the saint with Christ is set forth by the
   union of the stone with the building. Now, the stone in the building
   lies upon the foundation. There it rests and abides, being cemented
   fast to it. Do you rest upon Christ? I ask you, is He all your trust?
   There is a blessed text in one of the Prophets, "I will fasten him as a
   peg in a sure place and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his
   father's house, as well the cups as the flagons, they shall all hang on
   him."

   Do you so hang on Him? Can you feel today that without a falsehood all
   your trust on Him is set, that you bring from Him all your standing,
   all your confidence, all your peace? If so, let us hope that your union
   is a true one. And if it is so, then, as I have sometimes seen stones
   in the old walls of Roman castles which could scarcely have been
   separated from the fabric, even by gunpowder itself, without the
   blasting of the fabric, too--so is it with you. Unless the foundations
   can be removed, you cannot be moved, for if you depend on Him by a
   living faith, you are so a part of Christ that the living stone has
   grown into the living foundation and separated from Him you never can
   be in time or in eternity.

   Another question. If you are today in Christ, then do you bring forth
   some fruit unto Him? For Christians are represented as being in Christ,
   as the branch is in the vine. "Every branch in Me," said Christ, "that
   bears fruit, He purges it that it may bring forth more fruit." What do
   you say? What are your fruits? Is there humility of mind? Holiness? Do
   you seek to walk like Jesus did? My dear Hearers, this is a very sharp
   question to put to you, but I put it to each of you personally, for by
   your works you must be judged at the Last Great Day. His servants you
   are, whom you obey. If you give yourselves up to the pleasures of this
   world, to the lusts of the flesh, to your own selfishness--then you are
   the servants of sin.

   "Be not deceived, God is not mocked." "Whatever a man sows that shall
   he also reap." Do you of the Spirit bring forth fruits of the Spirit?
   Do you walk and act as the elect of God, putting on a heart of mercy
   and compassion? Have you a single eye to Christ's glory, and do you
   live to His service? If so, then thanks to God, no pruning knife shall
   cut away the branch that brings forth fruit. It is the branch which
   brings forth no fruit, which is not in Christ vitally, that is to be
   severed, cast away. But if you are in Him so as to bring forth fruit
   unto Him, then fruit to eternal life shall you bear evermore.

   Another question--Do you love Christ? Does your heart go out after Him?
   Do you pant to be in His arms? Is His company your Heaven? Is His
   absence your Hell? Remember, another figure which is used, is the union
   of the husband with the wife. Marriages that are made in Heaven are
   cemented not by gold or beauty, but by love. In Christ there is an
   infinite love towards His people, insomuch that He left His Father and
   did cleave unto His wife, and they two became one flesh. "This is a
   great mystery," said Paul, when he spoke concerning Christ and His
   Church. Are you wedded to Him by an affection which no time can alter
   except it be to deepen it? Are there ties which bind your heart to Him,
   which torture and racks cannot separate?

   If there are, then you are married unto One that will never put you
   away, One that will never leave you a widow, for your Maker is your
   Husband and He loves faithfully. He is One that calls you His
   Hephzibah, His soul delights in you. And your land He calls Beulah, for
   He has married it. Is there such a union? Are you thus in Christ? Then
   a last question and I will leave this point--Is there a life in you? Is
   Christ the life of your spirit? If you tell me you have nothing more in
   you than what nature gave you, then you are in nature's death. There is
   a supernatural life which is imparted by the Holy Spirit.

   Therefore, we read in Scripture that Believers are one with Christ as
   the members are one with the head. They are one in living union. If you
   cut away the head, the whole dies. Yes, and mark you, the head dies,
   too. So Christ is one with us if we are really His. Because He lives we
   shall live also. If we die, Christ dies, and if Christ lives, we live.
   And since He ever lives to make intercession for us, our eternal life
   is sure. But, oh, we must have this life! "Except a man eat My flesh,"
   says He, "and drink My blood, there is no life in him," as if there
   could not be spiritual life till Christ Himself were there, and Christ
   not there without becoming life to our souls.

   II. I now turn very briefly to our second point. The text tells us we
   are "ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED."

   To be brief and yet explicit, let me notice that I think the acceptance
   here meant, includes first of all, justification before God. We stand
   on trial. When we stand in Christ we are acquitted--while standing in
   ourselves the only verdict must be condemnation. The term "acceptance,"
   in the Greek, means more than that. It signifies that we are the
   objects of Divine complacency. When God looked upon the world of old,
   He said it was "very good"--and when the Lord looks upon His people in
   Christ, He says the same. But, methinks if there could be anything
   better than "very good," He would say His people in Christ were better
   than the work of His own hands, since they wear not a created
   righteousness, but the righteousness of the Creator, Jesus Christ
   Himself.

   They are, then, accepted by His justice, and they are viewed with
   complacency by His holiness. But this is not all. When it is written,
   "Accepted in the Beloved," it means that those accepted are the objects
   of the Divine delight. Friends, whenever I get to this thought, (and
   many a time in this House of Prayer I have got to it), I always feel
   inclined to sit down and let you think it over, for it is such an
   extravaganza of Divine Grace that we--worms, mortals, sinners-- should
   be the objects of Divine love! When princes wed with beggars the world
   marvels. But when God sets His affections upon sinful men and women in
   Christ, oh, this is the wonder of wonders! Even the angels might desire
   to look into it!

   I do believe that when we have been in Heaven ten thousand years, this
   will still be a subject of rapture and surprise--that ever He should
   have found anything in us in which He could take delight! To pity us,
   to show mercy to us-- that I can understand. But to love us! The big
   heart of God to love a creeping thing like man! The infinite soul of
   the Most High to pour itself out on such a mean, worthless creature as
   man! The everlasting God who fills all in all--to concentrate as it
   were, the powers of His Spirit and set the whole upon a creature that
   His own hands have made--a creature that had revolted and rebelled and
   at the best is worthless still! Oh, sing of this, you spirits before
   the Throne! We cannot speak of it today as we would.

   All this is, "in the Beloved." We are not accepted any way else but,
   "in the Beloved." Let me show you that this is the best way in the
   world to he accepted. Each of us knows it is the only way. But even if
   there were another, it is the best way. Suppose we could be accepted in
   ourselves. Adam was, while he was obedient--he was accepted in his own
   works. Yes, but how soon he fell! And then his acceptance fell, too. He
   stood on his own feet, and therefore he soon fell to the ground.
   Suppose you and I had kept the Law up till now. I think I hear you say,
   "Oh, I wish I had! I wish I could come before God as a perfectly
   righteous man." O Soul! You would not be half so safe as you are now in
   Christ.

   But if I had no sin, yet I would ask that I might be in Christ--for I
   might have sin some day--and then down would go the goodly structure!
   That which is built upon a fallible creature is built upon the sand.
   And if the structure had up to now been without one rotten timber, yet,
   since the basis is the will of man--and that might change--damnation
   might shortly overtake us. After all, we had done better, surely, to
   stand in Christ, who cannot fall.

   Now, I know some professors who seem to me to stand in their own
   experience, to be accepted in their own experience. At least that is
   their apprehension. Just now they had such visits from Christ's faith,
   such gleams of His love. And now they think God accepts them, for they
   feel so high, so heavenly-minded, so drawn above the earth! I have seen
   these same persons the next day feel their souls cleave to the earth
   and they have said, "Now, I am not accepted." O that these Beloved Ones
   would but know that God never did accept them in their experience--He
   accepted them in Christ. And He never can reject them till He rejects
   them in Christ, which cannot be, since He cannot reject Christ.

   I would that they would see that their "ups" make them no higher before
   God, and their "downs" make them no lower-- that all their high joys do
   not exalt them, and all their low despondencies do not really depress
   them in their Father's sight. They stand accepted in One who never
   alters, in One who is always the Beloved of God, always perfect, always
   complete, always without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing. Blessed
   faith, that walks above experience! Joyous trust that in the dark
   nights still sings of Heaven's unclouded noon, and in the midst of
   blackness and vileness consciously felt, still boasts of pardon bought
   with blood, of righteousness complete, and without flaw!

   The Arminians say our being accepted before God, if I understand it
   correctly, is also an acceptance in our graces. This is the English of
   their doctrine of falling away--while a man walks worthily, God accepts
   him. If he walks sinfully, then God accepts him no more. Those of you
   who like this way of being accepted, may choose it. For my part, I feel
   there is nothing can ever satisfy the craving of my spirit but an
   acceptance which lies utterly and wholly out of me and only and
   entirely in Christ Jesus. Why, Brethren, we would be accepted one day
   and rejected the next! No, more--we might be accepted one minute and
   rejected the next! If it lay in anything whatever in our walk, or in
   our work, we should be in the Covenant and out of the Covenant fifty
   times a day.

   But I suppose the Arminians have a difference between sin and sin.
   Surely, they must have the old Romish distinction between venial and
   mortal sin. For if sin puts a man out of Christ, I wonder when he is
   in--since we are sinning day by day. Perhaps there is a certain
   quantity of sin required to do it. Then that is only the old Romish
   dogma revived. Some sins, mortal on the Arminian theory, so as to put a
   man out of Divine Grace, and other sins venial, so that they can keep
   in Grace and sin, too. I glory in my God that I know--

   "Once in Christ in Christ forever, Nothing from His love can sever." If
   my good works had put me into Christ, then my bad works might turn me
   out of Him. But since He put me in when I was a sinner, vile and
   worthless--He will never take me out, though I am a sinner vile and
   worthless still--

   "Unchangeable His will,
   Though dark may be my frame;
   His loving, heart is still
   Eternally the same--
   My soul through many changes goes,
   His love no variation knows."

   Now, Christian, I want you this morning, to rejoice in this--you are
   accepted "in the Beloved." You look within and you say, "There is
   nothing acceptable here!" Man, look at Christ, and see if there is not
   everything acceptable there. Your frame depresses you, but look to
   Jesus, and hear Him cry, "It is finished!" Will not that death-note
   reassure you? Your sins trouble you. But remember they were laid upon
   the Scapegoat's head of old and they no more exist, for He has cast
   your sins behind His back and thrown them into the depths of the sea--

   "In your Surety you are free! His dear blood was shed for you!
   With your Savior's garments on, holy as the Holy One."

   While you have still to bear groans and doubts and fears, to fight with
   corruption, and to wrestle with temptation, you are still accepted in
   the Beloved.

   You are never accepted in yourself--you are but a condemned sinner in
   yourself. You are never anything but accursed both of God and of the
   Law out of Jesus. But in Christ never accursed, in Christ never
   condemned, for he that believes in Him is not condemned, and he that
   believes not is condemned already, because He believes not on the Son
   of God. "Accepted in the Beloved!" This sentence seems to me to be such
   a mouthful. It is a dainty all your own. Let it lie in your mouth like
   a wafer made with honey. "Accepted in the Beloved!"

   How I pity you who cannot say this. How I rejoice with you who can! You
   have troubles, you say--what are your troubles? You are accepted in the
   Beloved. You tell me you have to fight with flesh and blood--what of
   it?--so long as you are accepted in the Beloved? But you are so poor,
   you say, and you have to go home to a miserable meal today--but then,
   how rich you are--you are accepted in the Beloved! The devil is
   tempting you--never mind, he cannot destroy you, for you are accepted
   in the Beloved. Even the glorified souls are no more accepted than we
   are. They are only accepted in Heaven in the Beloved, but so are we!

   I have often thought that if the children of God could fall from Grace
   on earth, they could certainly fall from Glory in Heaven. What is there
   that keeps them holy in Heaven? Is it their own will? If so, the
   heavenly saints may become hellish fiends. Brethren, it is Christ that
   keeps them. They are in Christ, therefore they cannot fall--so are we
   in Christ--therefore shall we never fail nor fall away but unto the end
   shall we endure.

   III. Now, one minute upon the last point. That is, DIVINE OPERATIONS.
   He has made us accepted in the Beloved."

   Do not you see, Beloved, the whole way through, it is all of God and
   not of man? It was Christ who at first put us in His heart to be
   accepted there. It was the Father who put us in His Book according to
   the good pleasure of His own will to be accepted there. It was Christ
   that took us into His hands, according to His suretyship engagement,
   that we might be accepted there. It is Christ that took us into His
   loins, begetting us again unto a lively hope that we might be accepted
   there. And it is Grace that has united us in the Person of Christ that
   we may stand accepted there. You see, it is all of God from first to
   last. Jonah learned sound Divinity when he went into the whale's belly,
   for he said, "Salvation is of the Lord." And before the Throne of God
   in Heaven they always sing sound theology, for a part of the song is,
   "Salvation unto God and unto the Lamb." Not of man, neither by man--not
   of the will of man, nor blood, nor birth. But according to the counsel
   of Him that works all things according to the good pleasure of His
   will.

   Sinner! Does that suit you? You that are not in Christ in your own
   experience, does that suit you? It ought to do so. If you had to put
   yourself into Christ, you could not do it. Men and women, if God asked
   anything of you to qualify you for Christ, you could not do it. But He
   asks nothing of you whatever. His mercy comes to you, not when you have
   made yourselves alive, but while you are yet dead. It comes to you, not
   merely when you seek it, but it first seeks you and then makes you seek
   it--

   "No sinner can be beforehand with You-- Your Grace is most sovereign,
   most rich and most free." This is the good point about it, that it is
   most free. And this is the Gospel I am sent to preach to you this
   morning--"He that believes on the Lord Jesus Christ has everlasting
   life."

   Sinner, if you trust in Christ this morning, that act of faith shall be
   a point of union between you and Christ, and you shall be in Him
   vitally. Trust Christ, then, Soul. "Well," you say, "I have nothing. I
   have no reason to be satisfied, for I have no good works. But here
   evidently is a plan of salvation that does not want anything from me. I
   accept it." Say in your heart this morning, "If the Lord had asked any
   doings, or willings, or feelings of me in order that I might be in
   Christ, such a lost soul as I am, I could do none of these things. But
   when He tells me to believe in Christ, my soul perceives that He is
   able to save, and I know Christ is willing, and therefore I will trust
   Him this day."

   Soul, if you have done this, you are in Christ, you are accepted in the
   Beloved this morning. There may be a man that came in here a drunkard
   or a thief, that may yet go out of this place accepted in the Beloved.
   There may have come in here a woman of evil name, but if she believes
   in Christ, she shall go out accepted in the Beloved. She came in here
   in her own conscience condemned, she shall go out justified if she
   believes in Christ. If you can see Christ die and trust Him, and if you
   can see Christ risen and trust Him--if you can see Him pleading and can
   trust Him--then you are one with Him.

   God has made you accepted in the Beloved. Oh, precious salvation that
   comes all the way to where you are! Let you be where you may, so long
   as you are not in torments and not in Hell, this salvation comes to
   your door. God give you Grace to lay hold of it now, or rather that it
   may lay hold of you--and then you may say--

   "I do believe, I will believe That Jesus died for me, That on the Cross
   He shed His blood From sin to set me free."

   And if you believe in Him, by His Grace, your eternal life is sure,
   because you are one in Him, and, "accepted in the Beloved."

                         Believers--Lights In The World

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 28, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Do all things without murmurings and disputing, that you may be
   blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst
   of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the
   world; holding forth the Word of Life, that I may rejoice in the day of
   Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain."
   Philippians 2:14-16.

   We shall be very far from the truth if we suppose that Christian
   precepts have suffered any degeneration of meaning. If we imagine that
   the precepts of the Gospel were more stern in Apostolic times than in
   these later ages, we labor under a very gross and dangerous delusion.
   Fresh from the abominations of heathenism the early converts would
   naturally be placed under the mildest rules, rather than the more
   severe. If the Gospel could have known a change, the Apostle would have
   given its easiest precepts at the first, and then in these better days
   the whole Revelation would have been brought out and more stringent
   precepts would have been proclaimed.

   Since, however, it is contrary to the genius of the Gospel to be
   progressive in its Revelation, since it was all revealed at once, we
   must never imagine that the precepts given by Paul may be toned down
   and diluted to suit the present age. I say again, Brethren, if these
   men, fresh from the foul Stygian ditch of heathen abomination and
   lasciviousness, were nevertheless exhorted to the greatest sublimity of
   holiness, much more is it incumbent upon us to arrive at a very high
   state of Christian perfection and walk very near to God and be very
   close imitators of Christ.

   May God help us to hear, this morning, the address which Paul gave to
   the Church in Philippi. May we feel its full forge in our consciences
   and embody its full meaning in our lives.

   The Apostle says, "Do all things"--by which he seems to teach the
   activity of the Christian Church, for the Christian religion is not
   mere thinking or feeling but doing and working for God. "Do all things
   without murmurings," without murmuring at God's Providence--which was a
   common vice of the heathen, who, on their tombstones often recorded
   their protest against God for having removed their darlings and
   upbraided Him as cruel and unkind for taking away their relatives.

   "Do all things without murmurings against one another" Let your love be
   so hearty and sincere that you do not envy your richer or more talented
   Brethren. Let there be no low whispers traveling through your
   assemblies against those who ought to be esteemed among you. Whatever
   you do, let no murmuring be mixed with it, but labor with delight and
   suffer with patience. Let there be no murmurings even against the
   ungodly world. If they are unjust, bear their injustice in silence. Be
   not always offering complaints. There are a thousand things which you
   might speak of, but it is better that, like Aaron, you should hold your
   peace. To suffer in silence shall dignify you, and make you greater
   than ordinary manhood--for then you shall become like He--who before
   His accusers opened not His mouth.

   The Apostle continues, do all things without "disputing." Dispute not
   with God. Let Him do what seems good to Him. Dispute not with your
   fellow Christians, raise not railing accusations against them. When
   Calvin was told that Luther had spoken ill of him, he said, "Let Luther
   call me a devil if he please, I will never say of him but that he is a
   most dear and valiant servant of the Lord." Raise not intricate and
   knotty points by way of controversy. Remember, you have adversaries
   upon whom to use your swords, and therefore there is little need that
   you should blunt their edges by dashing at the armor of your fellows.

   Dispute not even with the world. The heathen philosophers always sought
   occasions for debate. Be it yours to testify what God has told you, but
   court not controversy. Be not ashamed to contend earnestly for the
   faith once delivered to the saints, but never do it in a spirit of mere
   debating--never because you wish to gain a victory, but only because
   you would tell what God has bid you reveal. "Thatyou may be blameless."
   Men will blame you, but you must seek, as Chris- tians, to lead lives
   that give no occasion for blame. Like Daniel, compel them to say of
   you, "We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we
   find it against him concerning the Law of his God."

   Erasmus writes of his great adversary, Luther, "Even Luther's enemies
   cannot deny but that he is a good man." Brethren, force this tribute
   from an unwilling world. Live so that as in Tertullian's age, men may
   say as they did in his time, "Such-and-such a man is a good man, even
   though he is a Christian." The heathens thought the Christians the
   worst of men, but were compelled to confess them to be the best, even
   though they were Christians. "Be you blameless and harmless," says the
   Apostle. The Greek word might be translated "hornless," as if you were
   to be creatures not only that do no harm but could not do any.

   Like sheep that not only will not devour but cannot devour, for it were
   contrary to their nature. For they have no teeth with which to bite, no
   fangs with which to sting, no poison with which to slay. If you carry
   arrows, let them be dipped in love. If you bear a sword, let it be the
   sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. But otherwise, be
   everywhere, even among those that would harm you, "holy, harmless,
   undefiled, separate from sinners." "As the sons of God," the Apostle
   goes on to say--as if the dignity of our relationship should beget in
   us an equally dignified deportment. "Remember," says the old
   philosopher--"Remember, O Antigonus, that you are a king's son!"
   Remember, O Christian, that you are a son of the King of kings--even
   God Himself!

   Soil not the fingers which are soon to sweep celestial strings. Let not
   those eyes become the windows of lust which are soon to see the King in
   His beauty--let not those feet be defiled in miry places, which are
   soon to walk the golden streets--let not those hearts be filled with
   pride and bitterness which are soon to be filled with Heaven, and to
   overflow with ecstatic joy. As "the sons of God," remember that the
   eyes of all are upon you. More is expected from you than from other
   men, because you have a higher pedigree, for you are descended from the
   very highest, Himself, and therefore should be the highest and best in
   the world.

   The Apostle then adds, "without rebuke." Men whom the world cannot
   rebuke. Men who can stand right straight up and defy their enemies to
   find any real fault in them. Men who can say without any Phariseeism,
   as Job did, "Lord, You know that I am not wicked." My Brethren, I would
   you were such that men must lie before they can revile you. I would
   have you men upon whose snow-white garments filth will not stick--who
   may be, and must be slandered, but cannot be really rebuked. O Beloved,
   to use Paul's own words, "Be you sons of God without rebuke, in the
   midst of a crooked and perverse nation."

   I have expounded the address of Paul. Permit me to remind you that all
   the while he is telling us to do this as the means to an end--and what
   is the end? Why, that we may, "shine as lights in the world in the
   midst of a crooked and perverse nation." The means themselves are
   precious. To be "holy, harmless and undefiled," is a glorious matter of
   itself. But when such a bright thing becomes but a means, how excellent
   must the end be! How desirable that you and I, and each one of us who
   has named the name of Jesus, should "shine as lights in the world,
   holding forth the Word of Life"!

   This brings me to the subject which I want to impress upon your hearts
   this morning. I would that every Believer here, whether member of this
   Church or of any of the part of Christ's family, might see to it, that
   from now on he should shine as a light in the midst of the darkness of
   this world, giving light to those that come within the range of his
   influence. There seems to me to be four things about which I may well
   speak. First, here is publicity required--they cannot shine without it.
   Here is, secondly, usefulness intended. Here is thirdly, position
   indicated--they are "in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation."
   And here is, fourthly, an argument suggested, that in the day of Christ
   I may rejoice that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.

   I. First then, here is A MEASURE OF PUBLICITY REQUIRED. You will note
   the text says they are to be lights. Now how can they be lights without
   being seen, and of what use would they be if they could be unseen
   lights? I cannot tell! But then, they are to shine, and how can they
   shine unless there is some radiance proceeding from them, and how this
   if they live in secret, and if they are never understood to be
   Christians at all? But then, where does the text say they are to shine
   as lights?--in their house? No, "in the world." True, they are to be
   lights in their own family--but moreover if they come up to the full
   standard of what they should be, they are to be lights in the world.

   These three words--lights, lights shining, and lights in the
   world--most positively teach that a Christian must have some degree of
   publicity, and that it is hardly possible for him to carry out his true
   character if he lives in such retirement and secrecy as never to be
   known to be a Christian. Some timid hearts there are, some gentle
   spirits, that shun altogether the exposure of their religion. They
   quote Nicodemus as if they did not know that Nicodemus is rather a
   beacon than an example. I would be far from crushing a tender spirit,
   far from laughing at the nervousness which may keep a man in the back
   rank when he ought to stand in the forefront of the battle.

   But if I should, by some Scriptural remarks, lead Christians to see
   that they are not to be always seeking retirement, but rather they must
   stand out and avow the Master. And if I can persuade the gentle spirit
   to bear its willing witness to Christ, thrice happy shall I be!
   Pharisees of old courted publicity. They could not give away one
   halfpenny in the street but they must sound a trumpet that everybody
   might see their splendid charity. They could not pray in their closet,
   but they must seek some corner of the street that every passerby might
   hold up his hands in amazement at the man who was so good that he
   prayed even in the street!

   The world has found this trick out. We usually say of ladies, when we
   find them working at parties, that they do not work at home. And we
   should surely think of people who pray in the streets, that they pray
   nowhere else. And of persons who show their charity publicly, that they
   show all that they have to show. Ostentatious religion nowadays is soon
   discovered and detected. But while we must be warned against the pride
   of the Pharisee, we must take care that we run not into another
   extreme. "Am I always to serve God by stealth? Am I never to speak a
   good word for Christ lest somebody should say I am proud?"

   Your own conscience will be your guide in that matter. If you detect in
   yourself any desire to glorify yourself--then you are wrong in making
   your religion public at all. Plainly, if you discover that you are
   keeping back in order to get an easier path for yourself--then you are
   grievously wrong in seeking to hide your religion. If it is for God's
   honor for you to publish on the housetops what He has told you in the
   closet, do it. And if it is for Christ's honor to do only in the closet
   that which another man would do in the street, do it. Your conscience
   will always teach you, if it is an enlightened conscience, when you
   might act boldly and when, on the other hand, you would be cowardly.

   I think there is no difficulty in steering between this Scylla and
   Charybdis. Any man with a little wisdom will soon discern what he ought
   to do. But do not, I pray you, make the Pharisee's pride an excuse for
   your cowardice. Never say, "I do not like to make a profession because
   there are so many hypocrites!" The more reason why you should make a
   profession that there may be some honest ones. Do not say, "Oh, I would
   not, for fear people should think I am proud!" Why should you look at
   the fear of man which brings a snare--is it not yours to obey God,
   rather than man?

   I cannot understand Christ's words--"You are a city set on a hill which
   cannot be hid." Nor these, "Let your light so shine before men, that
   they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in
   Heaven." Nor these, "He that with his mouth confesses and with his
   heart believes on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be saved."--I cannot
   understand these passages, if you are never to avow your faith, but
   keep your religion hidden up in a secret place and go to Heaven by
   stealth.

   How much publicity, then, do we really think is necessary in a
   Christian? It is becoming that he should make a public avowal of his
   faith. He should come out from among the world and declare himself to
   be on the Lord's side. There is an ordinance which God has Himself
   ordained, which is the proper way in which to make this profession--to
   be baptized in water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
   the Holy Spirit--thus openly being buried in water to show our death to
   the world, and rising out of the water to show that we hope to live a
   new life as the result of the resurrection of Christ from the dead.

   If you should differ as to the form in which this profession is to be
   made, yet the profession should be made. If you would be honest and
   true, you must in answer to the Master's summons, "Who is on the Lord's
   side?" come out and say, "Here am I, Lord, I am Your servant and I
   would serve You even to the end." You should also be associated
   constantly with Christian people. The one act of profession is not
   enough--it should be continued by union with some visible Church of
   Christ. We find in the Apostle's days that those who were converted
   were added to the Church. It is written, "They first gave their own
   selves to the Lord and unto us by the will of God."

   Christianity requires you to unite yourselves with those who are united
   to Christ. If the Church of Christ is the spouse of Jesus, you should
   seek to be a member of her visibly, as well as invisibly--especially
   you that are lately converted, for your presence in the Church is for
   your good, and much for the Church's comfort. The man that was healed
   stood with Peter and John. And it is written, when they saw the man
   that was healed standing with Peter and John, they could say nothing
   against them. The gathering together of the converts to sustain the
   minister is a very great help in the propagation of the Truth of God as
   it is in Jesus.

   Besides this association with Christians, there should be a daily
   carrying out of your Christianity in your life. It is not all that we
   say that shines. That may be only a flash, a sparkle, a display of
   fireworks--it is our daily acting which is the true shining out of
   Christ within. Let the servant prove her Christianity by being more
   attentive than any other. Let the master prove his by being more
   generous than any other master. Let the rich man shine in his
   liberality. Let the poor man shine in his patience. Let each in every
   sphere seek to excel those who are not in Christ, that so everyone may
   prefer us in our position to the worldling in the same office, and take
   knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus and have learned of Him.

   But to shine as lights, we must add the open testimony of our words. I
   will not give a rusty nail for your religion if you can be quiet about
   it. I do not believe you have any. That which is nearest to the heart
   is generally most on the tongue. You must be constantly bearing your
   witness by the words of your mouth for Christ, seeking to teach the
   ignorant, to warn the careless, to reclaim the backsliding and to bring
   the wanderers to the Cross. You will have many opportunities in the
   sphere in which you move, avail yourself of them all, and so shall you
   shine as a light in the world.

   And there are times when you cannot shine without a very bold and stern
   decision for Christ. When the old Roman senator, in the days of
   Vespasian, was told by the emperor that he might go into the senate
   house but he must hold his tongue, he answered, "I, being a senator,
   feel impelled to go into the senate house, and being in the senate, it
   is the part of a senator to speak what his conscience dictates."
   "Then," said Vespasian, "if you speak you will die." "Be it known to
   you, O Emperor," said he, "that I never hoped to be immortal, nor did I
   ever wish to live when I might not speak my mind."

   Brave Roman! We must have brave Christians, too, who say, "Being a
   Christian, it is mine to speak, and if that should cost me all I have,
   and life itself, I never thought myself immortal, and I wish to die
   when I may not speak out that which God has written in my heart." There
   are times, I say, when if we should falter, or delay, we become
   traitors at once--make sure that in those "crises of your being"--you
   promptly follow your Lord.

   So much of publicity I think is needed then--an open profession, a
   constant association with the Christian Church, a perpetual living out
   of godliness, an open declaration of the same, and a deliberate
   decision when occasion shall present itself. Look you, Sirs, Christians
   are soldiers. If our soldiers were to take it into their heads that
   they ought never to be seen, a pretty pass things would come to. What
   were the soldiers worth when they shunned parade, and dreaded battle?
   Take off your regimentals, and be packing, Sirs! We want not men who
   must always lie skulking behind a bush, and dare not show themselves to
   friend or foe.

   Christians are runners, too and what sort of runners are men who run in
   the dark? Not so, says the Apostle? He says, we are "encompassed about
   by so great a cloud of witnesses," and therefore bids us, "lay aside
   every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us." What? Running
   match and no spectators! Ave Imperator! The champion salutes you! He
   prays you to dismiss the spectators. Conscript fathers, leave your
   seats and you knights of the empire retire from the race! You common
   herd retire, or put your fingers to your eyes--here comes a runner who
   is so dainty that he cannot be looked at, a swift-footed racer who must
   be scrutinized by no vulgar eye or he will faint and lose the crown.

   Ha! ha! ha! ha! the mob laughs. "Ah," they say, "these are not the men
   to make a Roman holiday, these timid fools had better play with babes
   in the nursery, they are not fit to consort with men." What do you
   think of Christians who must have the stadium cleared before they can
   enter the course? Rather, O sons of God, defy all onlookers. Crowd the
   seats and look on, you angels, and men, and devils, too--and see what
   you will. What matters it to the Christian, for he is looking unto
   Jesus! He runs not for you but for the reward--and whether you look or
   look not--his zeal and earnestness are still the same. Christ is in
   him, and run he must, look on who will.

   II. Secondly, here is in the text, USEFULNESS. "Well" says one, "if I
   were known to be a Christian what use would it be?" We will soon show
   you. One remark, however, I will make--the better Christian you are,
   the more public you will be--but the less will be thought of you! You
   have noticed at night a star, it is only a little spark, but still it
   is very bright, and everybody says, "Do you see that star?" Yes, but
   there is a moon, why does not everybody say, "Look what a beautiful
   moon?" They notice the star first, because it is not usual to see stars
   so brilliant. By-and-by, of a moonlight night, you will hear people
   say, "What a lovely moon!"

   Now, in the daylight people do not say, "What a lovely sun!" No. "What
   a lovely landscape! What a beautiful view! Look at the tints of those
   trees now the sun is shining!" Just so, the little Christian is like a
   star, bright in his little sphere. Others are like the moon, they
   excite admiration and attention to themselves. But a full-grown
   Christian, who should be perfectly conformed to the image of Christ,
   though giving more light than either the moon or the star, would not be
   half so much looked at, for men would be looking at what he shed light
   upon, rather than upon him. They would look to the doctrine that he
   taught rather than to how he taught it. They would be looking rather at
   the lesson of his life than at the life itself. So that if I should
   urge you to more and more publicity, it will not be for your sake, but
   that you may be more and more forgotten, while the Truth of God is the
   more clearly seen.

   But what is the use of lights, what is the use of Christians as lights?
   The answer is manifold. We use lights to make manifest. A Christian man
   should so shine in his life that those who come near him can see their
   own character in his life, can see their sins, can see their lost
   estate. He should so live that a person could not live with him a week
   without knowing the Gospel. His conversation should be such that all
   who are about him should perfectly understand the way to Heaven. Things
   that men will not see and cannot see without him, should be very clear
   wherever he is.

   Men sometimes read their Bibles and they do not understand the Bible
   because they want light. Like Philip, we should be willing to sit in
   the chariot and instruct the passerby, making manifest the meaning of
   God's Word, the power of God's Word, the way of salvation, the life of
   godliness, and the force of the Truth of God. May I ask each one of
   you, have you made men understand the Gospel better? "Ah," says one, "I
   leave that to the minister." Then you have neglected your duty--repent
   of your great sin and ask God, now, to help you to be making manifest
   to all persons who come near you their sin and the Savior.

   The next use of a light is to guide. The mariner understands this. When
   our sailors, some years ago had a Nore light, they thought they were
   getting on marvelously. But when they had the Mouse, the Maplin, the
   Swin Middle, and all the other lights on the sands, they soon found
   navigation much easier than it had been before. Every Christian should
   light some part of the voyage of life, and there should not be a
   channel without its light. Blessed pole star! How many a slave have you
   guided from the swamps and whips of the South up to the country of the
   free? Blessed are you, O Christian, if your light has led some soul to
   Jesus, to the land of the free, where the slave can never wear his
   fetters again. I hope that you have often, when men have scarcely known
   it, pointed them the way to Christ, by saying, "Behold the Lamb of

   God."

   Lights are also used for warning. On our rocks and shoals a lighthouse
   is sure to be erected. Christian men should know that there are plenty
   of false lights shown everywhere in the world. The wreckers of Satan
   are always abroad, tempting the ungodly to sin under the name of
   pleasure. We must put up the true light upon every dangerous rock, to
   point out every sin and tell what it leads to, so that we may be clear
   of the blood of all men, shining as lights in the world.

   Lights also have a very cheering influence, and so have Christians.
   Late one night we had lost our way in a park not far from the suburbs
   of London, and we were walking along and wondering where we were. We
   said, "There is a light over there," and you cannot tell what a source
   of comfort that candle in a cottage window proved to us. I remember
   riding in a third class carriage, crowded full of people, on a dark
   night, when a woman at the end of the carriage struck a match and lit a
   candle--with what satisfaction was everybody's face lit up, as all
   turned to see it. A light really does give great comfort. If you think
   it does not, sit in the dark an hour or two. A Christian ought to be a
   comforter--with kind words on his lips and sympathy in his heart--he
   should have a cheering word for the sons of sorrow.

   Light, too, also has its use in rebuking sin. I think our street gas
   lamps are the best police we have. If those lamps were out, we should
   need ten times the number of watchers, and there would be far more
   crimes. Why is it that thieves do not like the light?--because their
   dark deeds can only be done in darkness. And how is it ungodly men do
   not like Christians? Why, because they rebuke them. And just as lights
   tend to make a city safe, and stop robberies and crime, so Christian
   men, when they are in sufficient numbers to act upon the commonwealth,
   will make crime less common--certainly they will compel it to hide its
   deformity under the shadows of night, whereas, before it might have
   walked in the blaze of day with approbation.

   But the Christian is a light in a very peculiar sense--he is a light
   with life in it. Turn the lantern upon that dead man's face. You can
   see it cold and white, like the chiseled marble. Shoot the light right
   into his eyes. He does not see.

   You cannot make him live by the power of any human light. But the
   Believer is God's lantern, full of the Holy Spirit-- and it happens
   often that through our testimony God shoots into the eyes of the dead a
   light which makes them live--so that the darkness of Hades gives way to
   the brightness of Glory and the midnight darkness of the spirit is made
   to fly before the rising Sun of righteousness.

   We have dwelt long enough upon the uses of these lights, and I may only
   say, in concluding this point, I wonder what is the good of a Christian
   who is not thus useful to the world? He has a treasure but he hoards
   it. What is the good of misers while they live? They are like swine
   which only eat--they are of no service till they die. Then they are cut
   up and their estates are pulled into pieces. And perhaps some good may
   be gotten by those who gets something to eat from them. Vile is the
   wretch who hoards gold, but what is he who hoards bread? The world is
   starving and they hoard the Bread of Life. It is like manna--it breeds
   worms and they cannot eat it themselves, but they will not give it to
   others.

   A religion that is no blessing to others, is no blessing to me--I am
   just laying up for myself a mass of putridity. It will never do my soul
   good, or else it would have compelled me to do good to others. But they
   are hoarding water, the Living Water. They are damming up the stream to
   keep enough for themselves, and what is it doing? It is covered with
   rank weeds. It breeds malaria. It turns foul. All manner of loathsome
   creatures are in it. They are more foolish still, they are trying to
   hoard up the light, as if they would have any the less if they let
   others have it. Hoard up light as if there were only a scant supply.

   Infamous! Diabolical! I wish there were a stronger word than that, "If
   any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha,"
   says Paul. And I question whether that dreadful anathema does not
   include within it those who do not love souls, and therefore prove they
   do not love Christ. For if they loved Christ they must love sinners. If
   they loved Jesus they must seek to extend His kingdom and to let Him
   see of the travail of His soul.

   III. But time waits not for me and I must proceed to touch with brevity
   upon the third point--POSITION INDICATED.

   "But," says one, "I cannot shine, it is of no use talking about it, I
   am not in a position to do any good." The Apostle anticipates you. He
   says, "In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation." "If I were to
   remove from this," says one, "I might serve the Lord's cause, but I
   cannot where I am." But, dear Friend, you are not to get out of it, you
   are to speak for your Lord where you are.

   In the midst of that crooked and perverse nation you are to shine as
   lights in the world. Your position teaches you three things. First of
   all, it should be an incentive to you. The worse the people are among
   whom you live, the more need have they of your exertions. If they are
   crooked, the more necessity that you should set them straight. And if
   they are perverse, the more need have you to turn their proud hearts to
   the Truth of God. The worse your position is, the more thankful you
   ought to be that you are in it. Where should the physician be but where
   there are many sick? Where is honor to be won by the soldier but in the
   hottest fire of the battle?

   Do not blame your position if you are an unprofitable servant, but lay
   the blame upon yourself. If you find it hard to do good where you are,
   it will be harder anywhere else. As the bird that wanders from her
   nest, so is the man that wanders from his place. Lazy workmen find
   fault with their tools and employers. If you transplant a tree to make
   it produce more fruit, you may possibly succeed, but there are nine
   chances to one that you will kill it altogether.

   Again, as you are in such a position, let it administer a caution to
   you. They are a crooked and perverse nation, do not wonder, therefore,
   if they hate your light and try to blow it out. Be the more anxious not
   to give them any unnecessary offense. Let your goodness be the only
   fault they can find in you. Ask the Lord to keep your lamp well trimmed
   for you. Beseech Him to protect it from their malicious breath. Be the
   more anxious to cultivate a close acquaintance with Christ, because a
   crooked nation would decoy you from Him. Do not try to please men--make
   not the opinion of this generation your rule, for it is very
   crooked--and if you travel one way you will not please them unless you
   turn the other way, and then turn again to humor their crooks.

   One is often amused to find one's self publicly abused for doing the
   very thing the opposite of which one was abused for the week before!
   And sometimes in the same newspaper article you will nowadays catch the
   writer first falling foul with you for doing one thing, and then
   falling foul with you for not doing it again. It is a crooked and
   perverse nation-- the man who tries to please man shall find himself in
   a labyrinth of the most mazy kind. He shall be a wretched time server
   all his life and a detestable hypocrite even to his death. Such a man,
   to use a rustic simile, is like a toad under a harrow, he will have to
   be crawling continually to escape the spikes on the right and the iron
   ties on the left. And he will probably die a miserable death with the
   iron in his soul at the last. Be cautious, but be particularly cautious
   against excessive caution. Please the Lord and let men please
   themselves.

   Once more, while the eyes of perverse men should be an incentive and a
   caution to you, do not forget the rich consolation afforded by the fact
   that all the saints have endured the like trial. Are you in the midst
   of a crooked people? So was Paul. So was the Church at Philippi--so are
   all the saints. Remember that as they won their crowns in a strife
   which was none of their choosing, so must you. They were not carried on
   beds of down to Heaven, and you must not expect to travel more easily
   than they. They had to hazard their lives unto the death in the high
   places of the field, and you shall not be crowned till you also have
   endured hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

   The road of your pilgrimage will not be smooth if it is the way of the
   Apostles and Prophets. Soft raiment, delicate nursing, dainty feeding
   and luxurious ease belong to the palaces of earth--but not to the
   company without the camp who bear their Lord's reproach. I charge you,
   O servants of the Lord, and you who are members of this Church
   especially, stand fast, wait, watch and wrestle. Be steadfast,
   unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.

   IV. To conclude, there is an ARGUMENT SUGGESTEAD. It is a very
   affectionate and touching one which I mean to take the liberty of
   applying to you, my Beloved flock. "That I may not run in vain, nor
   labor in vain in the day of Christ." The Apostle was the founder of the
   Church at Philippi. He had watched over them with all the anxiety of
   one who had planted and watered, and who looked for the increase. He
   therefore appealed to the affection which he knew they had for him. "I
   have run," argues the Apostle, "with all men looking on and
   gazing--many of them hating and scoffing. I have run with all my might,
   would you have me run in vain? I have labored, I have labored more than
   they all," the Apostle could say, "would you have me labor for
   nothing?"

   He knew the answer they would give him would be, "No, Beloved Paul, we
   would see you win the prize for which you did run, and reap the fruit
   for which you did labor." "Well," argues the Apostle, "but I cannot,
   except you shine as lights in the world. You disappoint my hopes, you
   snatch the prize from my grasp, you fill me with anguish, if you are
   not holy, heavenly-minded witnesses for Christ." I use the same
   argument with you. To the stranger here today it will have no force.
   But with many of you I know it will be an argument of power.

   How many out of this congregation first learned of Jesus from my lips?
   A multitude of you were brought to Christ through the preaching of the
   Word here, or in Park Street, or the Surrey Gardens, or Exeter Hall.
   The Word was feebly preached in rough language, then, as now--but God
   owned it--not to tens nor twenties, but to hundreds yes, to thousands
   of you--and, by His Grace, not to you only--but to people in every land
   and of every kindred. The Lord has made my spiritual children as many
   as the stars of Heaven for multitude. I rejoice, yes, I must rejoice,
   when I hear continually of the multitudinous conversions which are
   worked by the Holy Spirit through the sermons both printed and
   preached.

   God is with us and He does not let one Word fall to the ground. But
   what if you, as a Church, should be idle? What if your lives should be
   unholy? What if you should lack zeal and faith to testify for Christ?
   What then? My best expectations are defeated, my life has been a
   failure, and all that I have done falls to the ground. I have thought
   it in my heart, and I earnestly pray to my God that it may come to pass
   that here, as in a barracks, a great army may find its constant lodging
   place. That afterwards the Lord may pour you out like a vast conquering
   host, upon all parts of the world, to teach and testify, and live and
   labor, and speak for Christ. Surely, my Brothers and Sisters, you would
   desire this yourselves! I pray for it! Will you unite in desiring it
   and praying for it with me?

   It has happened of late, especially to me, to see God's hand very
   visibly. Never in my experience have I seen so much spiritual activity
   as just now, and while it is true of all sections of the Christian
   Church, it has been peculiarly so of that section over which it is my
   lot to preside. The sermons have been now for eight years scattered in
   English, Welsh, French, Dutch, German, Swedish--in fact, in all
   Protestant languages. At first there were many conversions--there are
   still. Next I find that those who were regular subscribers to the
   sermons begin to receive the doctrine of the preacher. The converts to
   Christ grow and get clear views of the Truth of God. Even in the point
   of Baptism there are great numbers who are convinced that it is most
   Scriptural that only Believers should be baptized. Very many have come
   here, and in the pool beneath, I have baptized them into the name of
   Christ.

   Our denomination does not increase. I am not very anxious that it
   should, for as it stands at present I have no great love for it. But
   our principles are spreading marvelously, and in this I must rejoice.
   As the result of this I have constantly letters like this, "Sir, Sir, I
   live in a village where the Gospel is not preached. There is a Church,
   it is true, but we have a Puseyite clergyman. Cannot you do something
   for us? You have many young men training for the ministry, could you
   not send a friend to preach in my drawing room?"

   Then comes another--"Sir, the Chapel has been shut up in our village a
   long time, could you not come and help us?" Then there are many of this
   kind--two Christian men write, wishing to be baptized into Christ--they
   come, they go back. Within a month there are four more from the same
   village. They go back and I almost forget them, but they do not forget
   me. Soon, the whole six will write a letter--this is a common
   thing--and say, "Could not we be formed into a Church? We will find a
   room--can you send someone to preach to us?" This happens every week,
   and your minister feels that as long as ever he has a man, he will say,
   "I will do it for you." And as long as he has any money of his own he
   will say, "Oh, yes, I will do it for you."

   But every now and then he wishes that he had some who would stand by
   him in larger attempts. Cheerfully you give week after week for the
   support of our young ministers, and I think our friends will continue
   to do this. At any rate, the Lord will provide and friends far away may
   be moved to assist us. I want still more aid, for the field is ripe,
   and we want more harvest men to reap it. It grows, the thing
   grows--every day it increases. It started but as a little flake of snow
   and now like an avalanche it sweeps the Alps' sides bare before its
   tremendous force.

   I would not now that you should prove unworthy of the day in which you
   live, or the work to which God has called us as a Church. Four Churches
   of Christ have sprung of our loins in one year and the next year shall
   it not be the same? And the next and the next, if the Holy Spirit is
   with us, and He has promised to be with us, if we are with Him.

   Now, in regard to the particular effort at Wandsworth, for which a
   collection is to be made. When I was sore sick some three years or more
   ago, I walked about to recover strength and walked through the town of
   Wandsworth. I thought, "How few attend a place of worship here. Here
   are various Churches but there is ample room for one of our own faith
   and order. Something must be done," I thought, "If I could start a man
   here preaching the Word, what good might be done." The next day, some
   four friends from the town called to see me, one a Baptist and the
   three others were desirous of Baptism, "Would I come there and form a
   Church?"

   We took the large rooms at a tavern and preaching has been carried on
   there ever since. Beginning with four, the Church has increased to one
   hundred and fifty. I have greatly aided the interest by going there
   continually and preaching and helping to support the minister. Now, a
   beautiful piece of ground has been taken, and a Chapel is to be
   erected, and I firmly believe there will be a very strong cause raised.
   We have many rising Churches, but this one has just come to such a
   point, that a House of Prayer is absolutely needed. I should not have
   asked you for this aid so soon, but the rooms in which they worship are
   now continually used for concerts on Saturday evenings and are not
   altogether agreeable on Sunday.

   I would just as soon worship in one place as another, for my own part,
   but I see various difficulties are now in the way, which a new Chapel
   will remove. I hope you will help them in so doing. Help me in the
   earnest effort of my soul to hold forth the Word of Life and to let
   Christ's kingdom come and His will be done. You that feel no desire to
   honor the Master--you that care nothing for the spread of His
   kingdom--you that are satisfied to hold your heads down and not boast
   and glory in Him--stand back and assist us not.

   But you who would help His kingdom--you who love His name--you who are
   the debtors of His Grace--help the cause everywhere, and help it this
   day. For Christ's sake, I ask it of you and by His Grace you will not
   deny me.

                               Good News For You

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 5, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was." Luke
   10:33.
   THE good Samaritan is a masterly picture of true benevolence. The
   Samaritan had no kinship with the Jew, he was purely of foreign origin,
   yet he pities his poor neighbor. The Jews cursed the Cuthites and would
   have no dealings with them, for they were intruders in their land.
   There was nothing, therefore, in the object of the Samaritan's pity
   that could excite his national sympathies, but everything to arouse his
   prejudices, hence the grandeur of his benevolence.
   It is not my intention, this morning, to indicate the delightful points
   of excellence which Christ brings out in order to illustrate what true
   charity will perform. I want you only to notice this one fact, that the
   benevolence which the Samaritan exhibited towards this poor wounded and
   half-dead man, was available benevolence. He did not say to him, "If
   you will walk to Jericho, then I will bind up your wounds, pouring in
   the oil and wine." Or, "If you will journey with me as far as
   Jerusalem, I will then attend to your wants."

   Oh, no, he came "where he was," and finding that the man could do
   nothing whatever for his own assistance, the good Samaritan began with
   him, then and there, upon the spot, putting no impossible conditions to
   him, proposing no stipulations which the man could not perform--but
   doing everything for the man, and doing it for him as he was, and where
   he was.

   Beloved, we are all quite aware that a charity of which a man cannot
   avail himself, is no charity at all. Go among the operatives of
   Lancashire and tell them that there is no necessity for any of them to
   starve, for on the top of Mount St. Bernard, there are hospitable monks
   who keep a refectory, where they relieve all passers-by. Tell them they
   have nothing to do but to journey to the top of the Alps and there they
   will find food enough. Poor souls! They feel that you mock them, for
   the distance is too great.

   Penetrate one of our back streets, climb up three pair of stairs into a
   wretched room, so dilapidated that the stars look between the tiles.
   See a poor young girl dying of consumption and poverty. Tell her, if
   you dare, "If you could get to the seaside, and if you could eat so
   much beef steak, you would no doubt recover." You are shamefully
   laughing at her--she cannot get these things. They are beyond her
   reach--she cannot journey to the seaside--she would die before she
   reached it. Like the wicked, your tender mercies are cruel.

   I have noticed this unavailing charity in hard winters. People give
   away bread and soup tickets to poor people who are to give sixpence and
   then receive soup and bread. And often I have had persons come to
   me--"Sir, I have a ticket. It would be worth a great deal to me, if I
   had sixpence to go with it to get the relief. But I have not a farthing
   in all the world, and I cannot make out the good of giving me this
   ticket at all." This is hardly charity.

   Think you see Jeremiah, down in the low dungeon--if Ebedmelech and
   Baruch had stood over the top of the dungeon and called out to him,
   "Jeremiah, if you will get half way up, we will pull you out," when
   there was not a ladder, nor any means by which he could possibly get so
   far, how cruel would have been this charity. But, instead thereof, they
   took old rags from under the king's treasury, and put them on ropes and
   bade him put the rags under his armholes and sling his arms through the
   ropes and then they pulled him up all the way. This was available
   charity. The other would have been hypocritical pretense.

   Brethren, if in the description of a good Samaritan, Christ describes
   him as giving to this poor wounded man a charity of which he could
   avail himself, does it not seem to be strongly probable--no, even
   certain--that when Christ comes to deal with sinners, He gives them
   available mercy--Divine Grace which may be of real service to them?

   Therefore, permit me to say I do not believe in the way in which some
   people pretend to preach the Gospel. They have no Gospel for sinners as
   sinners, but only for those who are above the dead level of sinnership
   and are technically styled sensible sinners. Like the priest in this
   parable. They see the poor sinner, and they say, "He is not conscious
   of his need, we cannot invite him to Christ." "He is dead," they say,
   "it is of no use preaching to dead souls." So they pass by on the other
   side, keeping close to the elect and quickened, but having nothing
   whatever to say to the dead, lest they should make out Christ to be too
   gracious and His mercy to be too free.

   The Levite was not in quite such a hurry as the priest. The priest had
   to preach, and might be too late for the service, and therefore he
   could not stop to relieve the man. Besides, he might have soiled his
   cassock, or made himself unclean. And then he would have been hardly
   fit for the dainty and respectable congregation over which he
   officiated.

   As for the Levite, he had to read the hymns. He was a clerk in the
   church, and he was somewhat in a hurry, but still he could get in after
   the opening prayer, so he indulged himself with the luxury of looking
   on. Just as I have known ministers say, "Well, you know we ought to
   describe the sinner's state and warn him, but we must not invite him to
   Christ." Yes, Gentlemen, you must pass by on the other side, after
   having looked at him, for on your own confession you have no good news
   for the poor wretch.

   I bless my Lord and Master, He has given to me a Gospel which I can
   take to dead sinners, a Gospel which is available for the vilest of the
   vile. I thank my Master that He does not say to the sinner, "Come half
   way and meet Me," but He comes "where he is," and finding him ruined,
   lost, obdurate, He meets him on his own ground and gives him life and
   peace without asking, or expecting him to prepare himself for Grace.
   Here is, I think, set forth in my text, the available benevolence of
   the Samaritan. It is mine this morning, to show the available Grace of
   Christ.

   I. The sinner is WITHOUT MORAL QUALIFICATION FOR SALVATION but Christ
   comes where he is.

   I want, if I can, not to talk about this as a matter having to do with
   the multitude that are abroad, but with us in these pews. I speak not
   of them and those, but of you and me. I want to say to every sinner,
   "You are in a state in which there is nothing morally that can qualify
   you for being saved, but Jesus Christ meets you where you now are."

   1. Remember first, that when the Gospel was first sent into the world,
   those to whom it was sent were manifestly without any moral
   qualification. Did you ever read the first chapter of Paul's Epistle to
   the Romans? It is one of those awful passages in Scripture, not
   intended to be read in congregations, but to be read and studied in the
   secrecy of one's chamber. The Apostle gives a portrait of the manners
   and customs of the heathen world, so awful, that unless our
   missionaries had informed us that it is exactly the photograph of life
   in Hindustan at the present moment, infidels might have declared that
   Paul had exaggerated.

   Heathendom in the time of Paul was so desperately wicked that it would
   be utterly impossible to conceive of a sin into which men had not
   fallen. And yet, "We turn unto the Gentiles," said the Apostle. And the
   Lord Himself commanded, "Go you into all the world, and preach the
   Gospel to every creature." What? To Sodomites, whose very smallest sin
   is adultery and fornication? To thieves and murderers, to murderers of
   fathers and mothers? Yes, go and preach the Gospel to them!

   Manifestly, the fact is that the world was steeped up to its very
   throat in the filth of abominable wickedness, and yet the Gospel was
   sent to it. This proves that Christ does not seek for any qualification
   of morality, or righteousness in man, before the Gospel is available to
   them. He sends the Word to the drunkard, to the swearer, the harlot,
   the vilest of the vile. For such is the Gospel of Christ intended to
   save.

   2. Remember again, the Biblical descriptions of those whom Christ cared
   to save in the world proves to a demonstration that He comes to the
   sinner where he is. How does the Bible describe those whom Christ came
   to save? As men? No, my Brethren--Christ did not come to save men as
   men, but men as sinners. As sensible sinners?--No, I think not. They
   are described as, "dead in trespasses and sins." But to the Law and to
   the Testimony, let me read you one or two passages. And, while I read
   them, I hope you may be able to say, "There is hope for me."

   First, those whom Christ came to save are described in 1 Timothy 1:15
   and many other places, as "sinners." "This is a faithful saying and
   worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to
   save sinners, of whom I am chief." "Sinners," without any adjective
   before the word. Not "awakened" sinners, not "repenting" sinners. But
   sinners, as sinners. "Surely," says one, "I am not shut out." Another
   account is found in Romans 5:6, "For when we were yet without strength,
   in due time Christ died"--for whom? Those who had some desires after
   God? Some respect to His name?

   No, "for the ungodly." Now, an ungodly man means a man without God, who
   cares not for God. "God not in all his thoughts," and therefore he is
   not what men call a "sensible sinner." The ungodly are like "the chaff
   which the wind drives away." Even these are the persons that Christ
   came to save. In the same chapter, 10th verse, you find them mentioned
   as "enemies." "When we were yet enemies, we were reconciled to God by
   the death of His Son."

   What do you say to this? They are not described as friends. Christ laid
   down His life for His friends in one sense-- "But God commends His love
   toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
   Enemies to God were the objects of Divine Grace, so that in enmity
   Christ comes and meets man where he is.

   In Ephesians 2:1 we read of them as, "dead in trespasses and sins."
   "And you have He quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins."
   Christ, then, does not ask the sinner to make himself alive. The Gospel
   is not only to be preached to those who have some good notions, some
   good desires, some trembling of the heavenly life within, but to the
   dead as dead. To the dead does Christ comes, and meets them in the
   grave of their sin.

   Again, Ephesians 2:3--they are "children of wrath." "We were by nature
   the children of wrath even as others." Yet the Gospel came to such. Can
   you see anything hopeful in a child of wrath? I ask you to look over
   him from head to foot--if this is his name and character--can you see a
   spot of goodness as large as a pin's point in the man? And yet such
   Christ came to save.

   Once again, they are mentioned as "accursed." "Ah," says one sinner, "I
   have often cursed myself before God, and asked Him to curse me." Well,
   Christ died for the accursed, Galatians 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us
   from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us." That is, for us
   who were under the curse. And, once more, they are described by the
   dreadful word "lost." They are lost to all hope, to all consideration
   for themselves. Even their own friends have given their case up as
   hopeless.

   "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost" (Luke
   19:10). If I understand those passages which I have read in your
   hearing, they mean just this--that those whom Christ came to save have
   no good whatever in them to co-operate towards their salvation. And
   Christ does not look upon them in order to find anything that is good
   in them. I am bold to say the only fitness for cleansing is filthiness.
   The only fitness for a Savior is being lost. And the only character
   under which we come to Jesus is as sinners, lost, dead and accursed.

   3. But, thirdly, it is quite certain from the work of Divine Grace
   itself, that the Lord does not expect the sinner to do anything or to
   be anything in order to meet him, but that He comes to him where he is.
   Look, Sinner, Christ dies on Calvary, a weight of sin is on His
   shoulders, and on his heart. In agonies the most awful, He shrieks
   under the desertion of His God.

   For whom did He die? For the innocent? Why for the innocent? What
   sacrifice did they need? For those who had some good thing in them? Why
   all these agonies for such? Surely a less price might do for them if
   they could eke it out themselves. But because Christ died on account of
   sin, I take it that those whom He died for must be viewed as sinners
   and only as such. Inasmuch as He paid a dreadful price, I gather that
   they must be dreadfully in debt, and that He died for those who had
   nothing to pay with.

   But Christ rose again, rose again for our justification. For whose
   justification? For the justification of those who were justified in
   themselves? Why, this were to perform an unnecessary work! No, my
   Brethren, for those who had no justification of their own, not a shadow
   of any, who were condemned, utterly condemned on account of their own
   works. Moreover, I hear Him by the ear of faith pleading before the
   eternal Throne. Who does He plead for? For those who have something to
   plead on their own account?--that were needless.

   Do men give their money to the rich? Do they spend their charity on
   those who do not need it? If men have something to plead for
   themselves, then why does Christ plead for them? No, Brethren, He
   pleads for those who have nothing whatever, that they can bring as an
   argument with which to enforce their prayers. But Christ ascended and
   received gifts. Who for? For those who merited rewards? No, verily, let
   them get them for themselves. But He received gifts for men-- yes, for
   the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them.

   But he gives the Holy Spirit. To whom does He give the Holy Spirit? To
   those that are strong, and good, and can do all themselves? O, my
   Brethren, no! He gives the Holy Spirit to those that are powerless,
   weak, dead. He gives the Holy Worker to those who are all unholy and
   full of sin. He puts the Omnipotent Influence into those who were
   slaves to the spirit of evil. Brethren, the work of Christ supposes a
   lost, ruined, rebellious sinner--and so I say--Christ meets the man
   where he is.

   4. Yet more, for I would clear up this point before I leave it, the
   godlike character of the Grace of God proves that He meets the sinner
   where he is. If God forgives little sinners only, then He is little in
   His mercy. If the Lord does not do something more than men can think,
   then we have made too much noise about the Gospel, and have exalted the
   Cross above measure. Unless there is something extraordinary in Divine
   Grace, then I cannot understand such a passage as this, "As high as the
   heavens are above the earth, so high are My ways above your ways, and
   My thoughts above your thoughts."

   I venture to say, Brethren, that many of us have thought of forgiving
   our enemies. It has sometimes been our happy portion to do good to them
   that hate us. Now, if God would be godlike in His Grace--and I am sure
   He will--He must do something more than that. He must not only forgive
   His enemies but they must be enemies of such an atrocious character
   that no man would have forgiven them--

   "Who is a pardoning Godlike You, Or who has Grace so rich and free?"
   But where is the meaning of this boast, if the Lord merely pardons
   sinners who are sensible of their sins and lament them? The marvel is
   in this--that while they are yet enemies He calls them by His Grace and
   invites them to mercy. Yes, more, He blots out their sins and makes
   them friends--thus meeting the sinner where he is.

   5. The spirit and genius of the Gospel utterly forbid the supposition
   that God requires anything in any man in order to save him.

   If salvation is offered to man upon a condition, they who fulfill the
   condition have a claim to the blessing. This is the old Covenant of
   Works. The substance of the legal Covenant is, "Do this and I will
   reward you." When the man has done it, he deserves what has been
   promised. Yes, and if you make the condition ever so easy, yet, mark
   you, so long as it is a condition, God is bound by His own Word, the
   condition being fulfilled, to give man what he has earned. This is
   works and not Divine Grace.

   It is debt and not free favor. But, inasmuch as the Gospel is free
   favor from beginning to end, I am absolutely sure that God requires
   nothing--neither good wishes, good desires, nor good feelings of a
   sinner--before he may come to Christ. But that he may know that
   everything is of Grace, the rebel is commanded to come just as he is,
   bringing nothing, but taking everything from God, who is superabundant
   in mercy, and therefore meets the sinner just where he is.

   I say to the sinner, wherever you may be today, if you are without any
   virtue, and if you are filled with all vice. If there are no good
   points in your character. If there is everything that is bad against
   man and against God in you. If you have committed every crime in the
   catalog, if you have ruined your body, and damned your soul, yet still
   Christ has said it--"Him that comes unto Me I will in no wise cast
   out." And if you come to Him, He can no more cast you out than if you
   had been the most virtuous, the most honorable, and the most devout of
   all living men.

   Only today believe in the mercy of God, in Christ, and cast yourself on
   Him and you are saved to the praise and glory of that Divine Grace
   which meets you just where you are, and saves you from sin.

   II. In the second place, there are very many of the lost race of Adam
   who say that they are WITHOUT ANY MENTAL QUALIFICATION. This is their
   excuse--"But, Sir, I never was a scholar. I was sent out as a boy to
   earn my own living, so that I never had a week's schooling. I am so
   ignorant that I cannot read any book and if anybody were to ask me to
   make a prayer I could not, I have not sense enough."

   Now, you see the Lord Jesus meets you just where you are. And how does
   He do this? Why, first, the saving act is one that requires no mental
   power. Faith lays hold on eternal life. Now, a child whose faculties
   are ever so little developed can believe what it is told. The child
   cannot reason, cannot argue, cannot dispute, cannot spilt hairs, cannot
   see a knotty point in theology, but it can believe what it is told.
   Faith requires so little mental vigor or intellectual clearness, that
   there have been many who were idiots in other things, who have been
   made wise unto salvation by the act of faith in Christ.

   You remember our Lord's own words, "I thank You, O Father, Lord of
   Heaven and earth, that You have hid these things from the wise and
   prudent and have revealed them unto babes." But this never could have
   happened had not the act which brings us into communion with Christ
   been the lowest act of the human faculty--that of simply trusting to
   Christ--as the result of crediting that which is told us upon good
   testimony.

   But then, again, to meet this defect of mental power, remember the
   singular simplicity of that which is believed. Is there anything more
   simple in the world than the doctrine of the Atonement. We deserve to
   die, Christ dies for us. We are in debt, Christ pays for us. Is not
   this plain enough for a Ragged School child? It is so plain, that many
   of our learned doctors of Divinity try to take it out of the Bible.
   They think, "If this is the marrow of it all, then any fool can be a
   theologian." So they kick against it.

   What is Unitarianism but a stumbling at the simplicity of the Cross.
   There were Unitarians who stood at the Cross when Christ died. they
   said, "Let Him come down from the Cross and we will believe on Him."
   That has been the Unitarian character ever since. They will receive
   Jesus anywhere but on His Cross. But up there, dying in man's place, he
   is so commonplace, that these great gentlemen run to philosophy and
   vain deceit sooner than lay hold on that which the most common may as
   fully understand as they.

   Yet more. To meet any mental deficiency in man, while the Truth of God
   itself is simple, it is taught in the Bible under such simple
   metaphors, that none can say they cannot understand it. How simple is
   the metaphor of the brazen serpent, held up before the snake-bitten
   Israelites, while they are commanded to look and live? Who does not
   understand that a look at Christ, who dies in the place of men, will
   make them live? "If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink."
   Who does not understand the figure of a fountain flowing in the
   streets, that every thirsty passerby may put his lips down and drink?

   "Behold the Lamb of God." Who does not understand the sacrifice? Here
   is a lamb killed for the sin of Israel, and so Christ dies for the sin
   of those who believe in Him. The act of faith is simple, the object of
   faith is plain. The metaphors make it clear, and he is without excuse
   who does not understand the Gospel of Christ.

   To crown all, to you, my Beloved Hearers, Christ has given you
   abundance of teachers. There sits in your pew with you today a man of
   your own rank and calling, who will explain to you the Gospel, if you
   do not understand it. Here are many of us, who are but too glad if we
   can roll away the stone from the door of your sepulcher. Here are
   children of God themselves, saved by Sovereign Grace, and if you really
   do not know the way, do but touch your neighbor and say to him, "Can
   you explain to me yet more clearly what I must do to be saved?"

   Now, this is meeting you, let your brains be the very smallest. This is
   coming down to you, though you sit on the lowest step of human
   intellect. Jesus Christ meets you just where you are.

   III. But yet again. I think I hear another say, "I am in despair, for I
   CANNOT FIND ANY REASON IN MYSELF, OR OUT OF MYSELF, WHY GOD SHOULD
   FORGIVE SUCH A PERSON AS I AM."

   So then, you are in a hopeless state--at least you see no hope. The
   Lord meets you where you are, by putting the reason of your salvation
   altogether in Himself. Shall I remind you of one or two texts which
   will surely satisfy you? "I, even I, am He that blots out your
   transgressions." What for? "For My own sake." He cannot pardon you for
   your sake, you clearly see that. And you feel that He cannot pardon you
   for other people's sake. But for "My own sake," says He, "that I may
   glorify Myself." Not in you but in His own mighty breast He finds the
   motive, that He may make His own mercy illustrious. For His own sake He
   will do it.

   Or take another--"For My name's sake, even for My name's sake, will I
   defer My anger, that I cut you not off." Here it is again--for His
   name's sake, as if He knew He could not find any motive, so He puts it
   all on Himself. He pardons, that He may honor and glorify His own name.
   Sinner, you can not say that this does not meet your case--for if you
   are the most hellish good-for-nothing sinner that ever cursed God's
   earth, and polluted the air you breathe, yet He can save you, for His
   own sake. There is still room for you to hope. For the bigger the
   sinner you are, the more glory to Him if He saves you. And if salvation
   is given for a reason only in Himself, there is, therefore, a reason by
   which He can save you, even you.

   Remember that He puts His own design before your eyes to show you that
   if you have no reason in yourself, that is no hindrance to His saving
   you. What is God's design in saving men? When He brings them to Heaven,
   what will be the result of it? Why, that they may love and praise His
   name forever and sing, "Unto Him that loved us and washed us from our
   sins in His blood, unto Him be glory." You are just the man. If you are
   ever saved and brought to Heaven, oh, will you not praise His Grace?

   "Yes," said one old man who had long lived in sin, "if He ever does
   bring me to Heaven, He shall never hear the last of it, for I will
   praise Him throughout eternity." Why, do you not see that you are the
   man? You are the very man that will answer God's design, for who shall
   love so much as he who has had much forgiven? And who shall praise so
   loudly as he whose mighty sins have been overcome by the mighty love,
   and goodness, and Grace of God? You can not say that it does not meet
   you, for here is a motive and a reason--though you can find none in
   yourself.

   Here is another reason why God should save you--it is His own Word, the
   Word of Him that cannot lie. I will bring up that text again, perhaps
   there is a heart here that will be able to cast anchor on it--"Him that
   comes unto Me I will in no wise cast out." You say, "But if I come, I
   can see no reason why He should save me." I answer, there is a reason
   in His own promise. God cannot lie. You come. He will not cast you out.
   He says, "I will in no wise cast out." "But," you say, "He may for
   such-and-such a reason."

   Now, this is a flat contradiction. The two cannot stand. If there is
   anything that is necessary in order for a soul to come, and you come
   without it, yet there is the promise--and as it has no limit in it,
   plead it--and the Lord will not refuse to honor His own Word. If He can
   cast you out because you have not some necessary qualification, then
   His Word is not true. Whoever you may be, whatever you may not be, and
   whatever you may be, if you believe in Jesus Christ, there is a reason
   in every attribute of God why you should be saved.

   His Truth cries, "Save him, for You have said 'I will.' " His power
   says, "Save him, lest the enemy deny Your might." God's wisdom pleads,
   "Save him, lest men doubt Your judgment." His love says, "Save him."
   His every attribute says, "Save him." And even Justice, with its hoarse
   voice, cries, "Save him, for God is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins, if we confess our sins."

   I am trying to fish in deep waters after some of you that have long
   escaped the net. I know when I have given free and full invitations,
   you have said, "Ah, that cannot mean me." You are without faith in
   Christ, because you think you are not fit. I will be clear of your
   blood this morning. I will show you that there is no fitness wanted,
   that you are commanded now to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as you
   are, for Jesus Christ's Gospel is an available Gospel, and comes to you
   just where you are. Without moral or mental qualification, and without
   any sort of reason why He should save you, He meets you as such and
   bids you trust Him.

   IV. We proceed to our fourth point. "Oh," says one, "but I am WITHOUT
   COURAGE. I dare not believe on Christ. I am such a timid, trembling
   soul, that when I hear that others trust Christ, I think it must be
   presumption. I wish I could do the same, but I cannot, I am kept under
   by such a sense of sin, that I dare not. O Sir, I dare not, it would
   look as if I were flying in the face of Justice if I were to dare to
   trust Christ and then to rejoice in the pardon of my sin."

   Very well, Christ comes to meet you where you are, by very tender
   invitations. "Ho, everyone that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he
   that has no money, come you, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk
   without money and without price." "Come unto Me, all you that labor and
   are heavy laden and I will give you rest." "The Spirit and the bride
   say, come. And let him that hears say, come." "And let him that is
   athirst, come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life
   freely."

   How sweetly He puts it to you. I do not know where more wooing words
   could be found, than those the Savior uses. Will you not come when
   Christ beckons, when with His loving face streaming with tears, He bids
   you come to Him? What? Is an invitation from Him too little a thing for
   you? O Sinner, trembling though you are, say in your soul--

   "I'll to the gracious King approach,
   Whose scepter pardon gives;
   Perhaps He may command my touch,
   And then the suppliant lives."

   Knowing that you would neglect the invitation, He has put it to you in
   the light of a command. "This is the commandment, that you believe on
   Jesus Christ whom He has sent." "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
   you shall be saved." "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved.
   But he that believes not shall be damned." He thought you would say,
   "Ah, but I am not fit to accept the invitation." "Well," says He, "I
   will command the man to do it."

   Like a poor hungry man with bread before him, who says, "Ah, it would
   be presumption on my part to eat," but the king says, "Eat, Sir, or I
   will punish you." What a generous and liberal command! Even the threat
   itself has no anger in it. Like the mother, who, when the child is near
   to die, and nothing will save it but the medicine, and the child will
   not drink, she threatens the child, but only out of love to it that it
   may be saved. So the Lord does add threats to commands.

   For sometimes a black word will drive a soul to Christ where a bright
   word would not draw it. Fears of Hell sometimes make men flee to Jesus.
   The weary wing made the poor dove fly to the ark--and the thunderbolts
   of God's justice are only meant to make you fly to Christ the Lord.

   Beloved, once more, my Master has sweetly met your want of courage by
   bringing many others, so that you may follow their example. As fowlers
   sometimes have their decoys, so my Master has decoys that are to draw
   others to Him. Other sinners have been saved, others He has cleansed
   who did but trust Him. There was Lot. Ah, Lot! Guilty of drunkenness
   and incest, and yet a saint of God. David the adulterer and murderer of
   Uriah and yet washed "whiter than snow."

   Manasseh the bloody persecutor, who had cut Isaiah in two, sawing him
   in halves, and yet he was taken among the thorns, and God had mercy on
   him. What shall I say of Saul of Tarsus, the persecutor of God's
   people? And the robber dying on the Cross for his crimes, and yet
   saved? Sinner, if these do not induce you to come, what can overcome
   your sinful diffidence? "But," says one, "you have not hit my case yet.
   I am an outrageous sinner!"

   Well now, I will hit it this time. In 1 Corinthians 6:9, hear the Word
   of the Lord, "Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
   effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor
   covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit
   the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but you are washed, but
   you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus
   and by the Spirit of our God."

   Why, Brethren, what horrible descriptions there are here! There are
   some of them so bad that when we have read the description, we wish to
   forget the sin. And yet--and yet, glory be to Your Almighty Grace, O
   God!--such have You saved and such You save still. O, timid Sinner, can
   you not trust in Jesus after this?

   Hear the Word of the Lord again in Titus 3:3-5--"For we ourselves also
   were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving many lusts and
   pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.
   But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man
   appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
   according to His mercy He saved us."

   Now, you hateful sinners, and you that hate others. You that are full
   of malice and envy, here is the gate open, even for you, for the
   kindness and love of God towards man appears in the Person of Christ.
   Listen to another, for God's Words are more than mine, and I do hope
   they will attract some of you. In Ephesians 2:1-3--"Dead in trespasses
   and sins. Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of
   this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
   that now works in the children of disobedience. Among whom also we all
   had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh,
   fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind. And were by nature
   the children of wrath, even as others.

   "But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved
   us, even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with
   Christ, (by Grace you are saved), and has raised us up together and
   made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." What for?
   "That in the ages to come"--mark this--"He might show the exceeding
   riches of His Grace in His kindness towards us through Christ Jesus."

   One more passage and I will not weary your attention. O that this last
   passage might comfort some of you! It is Paul who speaks in 1 Timothy
   1:13, "I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor and injurious: but I
   obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the Grace
   of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love, which is in
   Christ Jesus. This is a faithful saying." See how he puts it from his
   own experience, "and worthy of all acceptation." And therefore worthy
   of yours, poor sinner, "that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
   sinners, of whom I am chief."

   "Ah" says one "but he would not save any more." Let me go on--"Howbeit
   for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might
   show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should
   hereafter believe on Him to life everlasting."

   So that if you trust as Paul did, you shall be saved as Paul was, for
   his conversion and salvation are a pattern to all those who should
   believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, unto life everlasting. So Sinner,
   timid as you are, here Jesus meets you. O, I wish I could say a word
   that would lead you poor tearful ones to look to Jesus! O, do not let
   the devil tempt you to believe that you are too sinful. "He is able to
   save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him"--

   "Let not conscience make you linger,
   Nor of fitness fondly dream."

   Fitness is not needed--do but come to Him. You are black in sin, and
   you do not feel your blackness as you ought-- that makes you all the
   blacker. Come, then, and be clean. You are sinful, and this is your
   greatest sin, that you do not repent as you ought. But come to Him and
   ask Him to forgive your impenitence. Come as you are--if He rejects one
   of you, I will bear the blame forever. If He casts one of you away that
   shall trust Him, call me a false prophet in the day of the
   resurrection. But I pawn my life upon it--I stake my own soul's
   interest on this--that whosoever comes unto Him, He will in no wise
   cast out.

   V. I hear one more complaint. "I am WITHOUT STRENGTH," says one, "will
   Jesus come just where I am?" Yes, Sinner, just where you are. You, you
   say, cannot believe, that is your difficulty. God meets you, then, in
   your inability. First, He meets you with His promises. Soul, you can
   not believe. But when God, that cannot lie, promises, will you not
   believe, can you not believe, then? I think God's promise--so sure, so
   steadfast--must overcome this inability of yours, "Him that comes to
   Me, I will in no wise cast out." Cannot you believe now? Why, that
   promise must be true!

   But next, as if He knew that this would not be enough, He has taken an
   oath with it--and a more awful oath was never sworn--"As I live, says
   the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, but had
   rather that he should turn unto Me and live. Turn you, turn you, why
   will you die, O house of Israel." Can you not believe now? What? Will
   you doubt God when He swears it? Not only make God a liar but--let me
   shudder when I say it--will you think that God can perjure His own
   Self?

   God forbid you should so blaspheme! Remember, He that believes not has
   made God a liar, because He believes not on the Son of God. Do not do
   this! Surely you can believe when the promise and the oath compel you
   to faith. But yet more, as if He knew that even this were not enough,
   He has given you of His Spirit. "If you, being evil, know how to give
   good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father
   give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?" Surely with this you can
   believe.

   "But," says one, "I will try." No, no, do not try. That is not what God
   commands you to do--no trying is wanted. Believe Christ now, Sinner.
   "But," says one, "I will think of it." Do not think of it. Do it now,
   do it at once for this is God's Gospel. There are some of you standing
   in these aisles, and sitting in these pews, who I feel in my soul will
   never have another invitation. And if this is rejected today, I feel a
   solemn motion in my soul--I think it is of the Holy Spirit--that you
   will never hear another faithful sermon, but you shall go down to Hell
   impenitent, unsaved, unless you trust in Jesus NOW.

   I speak not as a man but I speak as God's ambassador to your souls, and
   I command you, in God's name, trust Jesus, trust Him now. At your peril
   reject the voice that speaks from Heaven, for "he that believes not
   shall be damned." How shall you escape if you neglect so great a
   salvation? When it comes right home to you, when it thrusts itself in
   your way, oh, if you will neglect it, how can you escape? With tears I
   would invite you, and, if I could, would compel you to come in. Why
   will you not?

   O Souls, if you will be damned, if you make up your mind that no mercy
   shall ever woo you, and no warnings shall ever move you, then, Sirs,
   what chains of vengeance must you feel that slight these bonds of love?
   You have deserved the deepest Hell, for you slight the joys above. God
   save you. He will save you, if you trust in Jesus. God help you to
   trust Him even now, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                Faith Omnipotent

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 12, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Jesus said unto him, If you can believe, all things are possible to
   him that believes.'"

   Mark 9:23.

   I MUST take your minds back to the scene in the midst of which Christ
   uttered these memorable words. Christ had been upon the mountaintop,
   transfigured in the presence of His three disciples. During His absence
   the disciples remaining had been put to a nonplus. They found
   themselves, for lack of faith, unable to work a miracle. And the
   Pharisees triumphed. Christ came down just at the very moment and
   turned the scale.

   We find a parallel case in the story of Moses, when with his servant,
   Joshua, he went up to the mountain and beheld the glory of the Lord.
   While he and Joshua were absent, evil lifted up its head, and those who
   would walk by sight prevailed over the poor weak faith of Aaron, so
   that he made for them a golden calf. And lo, as Moses returned, he saw
   the people given up to the worship of this image which they could see
   with their eyes and handle with their hands. Faith had left the field
   routed, because the champion was not there, and sinful sight was for
   the moment triumphant.

   Moses dashes boldly into the midst of the people and instantly they are
   put to confusion. Some tremble and the most brazen of them are made to
   hang their heads. He lays hold upon their molten calf, grinds it to
   powder and makes them drink it.

   Now, our Lord with his Joshuas--Peter, James, and John, the three elect
   out of the elect--had been on the mountain of transfiguration. The
   rest, like Aaron, found themselves attacked by those who would have
   signs and wonders. And being unable to furnish these signs and wonders
   for lack of faith, the Pharisees pushed their advantage, and the hosts
   of God seemed to fly before them. But suddenly, like a great King,
   Christ stands in their midst. The Pharisees are abashed. A miracle is
   performed. Faith triumphs, and the doubters are shamed.

   It is as if some mighty general who, having been absent from the field
   of battle, finds that his lieutenants have rashly engaged in action,
   and have been defeated. The left wing is broken, the right has fled,
   and the center begins to fail. He lifts his standard in the midst of
   his troops and bids them rally around him. They gather. They dash upon
   the all but triumphant enemy, and soon they turn the balance of
   victory, and make the late victors turn their ignominious backs to
   flight.

   Brethren, here is a lesson at the very outset. What we need for
   conquest is the shout of a king in the midst of us. The presence of
   Christ is victory to His Church--the absence of the Lord Jesus entails
   disgraceful defeat. O armies of the living God, count not your numbers!
   Rely not upon your strength. Reckon not upon the ability of your
   ministers. Trust not in human might. Nor on the other hand be dismayed
   because you are few, nor tremble because you are feeble. If He is with
   you, more are they that are for you than they that are against you.

   If Christ is in your midst, there are horses of fire and chariots of
   fire round about you--

   "When He makes bare His arm, Who can His cause withstand? When He, His
   people's cause defends, Who? Who shall stay His hand?" Lift up your
   eyes, then, to the hills from where Jesus comes who is your Help, and
   entreat Him never to forsake His people but to dwell with them, and
   walk among them forevermore.

   The matter about which the dispute had arisen was this--a certain man
   had a demoniac son who was afflicted with a dumb spirit which threw him
   into convulsions and ravings of the most hideous kind. The father,
   having seen the futility of the endeavors of the disciples, had little
   or no faith in Christ, and therefore, when he was bid to bring his son
   to him, he said to Jesus, "If you can do anything, have compassion on
   us and help us."

   Now there was an "if in the request, but the poor trembling father had
   put the "if in the wrong place. Jesus Christ, therefore, without
   telling him to retract the "if," just puts it in its legitimate
   position. "No, verily," He seemed to say, "there should be no 'if about
   My power, nor about My willingness, the 'if lies somewhere else." "If
   you can believe, all things are possible to him that believes." The man
   received faith, offering at the same time a humble prayer for an
   increase of faith, and instantly Christ spoke the word and the devil
   was cast out with an injunction never to return.

   Brethren, you and I see that there is an "if somewhere, but we are
   perpetually blundering by putting it in the wrong place. //"Christ can
   convert heathens? No, no, if the Church can believe He can! //"Christ
   can make the ministry successful? No, if you can believe He can!
   //"Christ can give me the pardon of sin, if He can give me high
   enjoyments, if He can lift me above doubts and fears? Not so,
   Brethren--not so. You have misplaced your "if." It is if you can
   believe. For if you can, even as all things are possible to Christ, so
   shall all things be possible to you.

   Faith stands in God's power and in God's majesty. It wears the royal
   apparel and rides on the king's horse, for it is the Divine Grace which
   the king delights to honor. Girding itself with the glorious might of
   the all-working Spirit, it becomes, in the Omnipotence of God, mighty
   to do, to dare and to suffer. "All things," without limit, "are
   possible to him that believes."

   I shall, this morning, dwell upon some of the achievements offaith and
   then notice where faith's great power lies. God help us to speak on
   both of these points with Divine power.

   I. First, SOME OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF FAITH. Time would fail me if I
   should attempt to rehearse the record of those who have earned a good
   report through faith. It is not necessary that my humble tongue should
   recapitulate what Paul, with inspired lips, has uttered in the ears of
   the Church. Turn to the 11th chapter of Hebrews and see there a mighty
   triumphal arch which God the Holy Spirit has raised in commemoration of
   the splendid triumphs which faith has achieved. Behold this tower of
   David, built for an armory, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all
   shields of mighty men.

   With joy the Church recounts her worthies, for the Lord utters His
   voice before His army, for His camp is very great. But it needs not
   that I remind you of these ancient things, I will rather speak of some
   of the things which faith can perform today, even today.

   1. First, we will consider faith in its relationship to guilt. Here we
   may say, in your hearing, if you can believe guilt can be
   removed--perfect pardon and complete justification are possible to the
   vilest sinner, if he can believe in Christ. Behold, my Brethren, faith
   going forth to conflict with sin. Mark for a moment its determined
   struggles but see it coming back, like David, with Goliath's head in
   his hand--a mighty conqueror--through the strength of its God. Faith,
   in dealing with sin, does not forget the greatness of it. Our sin is
   tremendous--it is not possible for us to overestimate its guilt.

   The sinner, under the most awful convictions, never exaggerated the
   evil of sin, it is a dreadful and a bitter thing. But faith deals thus
   with it, "What if my sin is great? I have a great Savior--surely He is
   able to take my sin, even if it were a hundred times as great as it
   is--and to cast it all into the depths of the sea. I know that I have
   greatly revolted and have sinned with many aggravations against my God.
   But I believe in His great mercy, and I know that He is able to blot
   out my sins like a cloud and my transgressions like a thick cloud."

   Faith does not lessen sin in the estimate of a sinner. But it exalts
   Christ, so that the sinner firmly and fully believes that if his sin
   could be multiplied by all the number of the elect, yet He who is
   mighty to save could roll all the burden away and make him free. The
   greatness of sin is no barrier to its removing, if you can believe.

   Many, also, are troubled with a consciousness of the ill consequence of
   sin. They are made to look into Hell. They seem to hear the wailings as
   they ascend from the place of torment. Such awful passages as these are
   in their troubled mind--"Tophet is prepared of old, the pile thereof is
   wood and much smoke." "These shall go away into everlasting punishment,
   where their worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched." But faith
   says, "Yes, but despite all this, the agonies of Christ were so great
   that they are a fit and full expiation by which all these torments can
   be, by God's mercy, fully removed from those who trust in Jesus--and
   they can even mount to the upper skies."

   To know the consequence of sin, and yet believe that Christ can
   pardon--this is faith work. Not to make out sin to be a peccadillo, a
   small and trivial offense--but to confess that the full weight of God's
   eternal arm can be none too heavy to fall upon the man who has dared to
   insult his Maker's laws. But despite all this, to believe that the
   Atonement made by blood upon the Cross is enough, and more than enough,
   to expiate all--this is the victory of faith--to know that the blood of
   Jesus Christ, God's dear Son, cleans us from all sin.

   Multitudes, also, I know, are very much vexed by remembering what guilt
   has done in them. "I am," says such an one, "so hard-hearted, I have so
   little repentance, I am so prayerless, I have nothing good in me. I am
   everything that is vile. There is not a commendable thing in me to move
   the pity of God." Now faith comes in and says, "It is even so. But,
   despite all this, I do believe the naked promise of God. I come to
   Jesus as I am, having nothing in myself, but possessing all things in
   Him."

   Nor will faith let the hardness of the heart, or the stubbornness of
   the will be any argument why the soul should not rest on Christ.
   Believing all that could be laid to its charge, and sorrowfully
   repenting of it all, still faith says, "It is written, 'Him that comes
   to Me, I will in no wise cast out.' I come, and Jesus cannot, will not,
   cast me out." When I feel my soul softened, when I feel the motions of
   the living fire within, then to believe that Christ can save me is no
   great faith.

   But when I feel no spiritual life, when my heart is as hard as a nether
   millstone, and I see myself as corrupt as a dunghill, then to believe
   in Him that justifies the ungodly--then to take the mercy which Christ
   gives to the very chief of sinners--this is a masterpiece of faith. And
   herein faith makes all things possible to him that believes--

   "In hope against all human hope,
   Self desperate, I believe
   Your quickening word shall raise me up,
   You shall the Spirit give."

   The thing surpasses all my thought, but faithful is my Lord. Through
   unbelief staggers not, for God has spoken the word--

   "Faith, mighty faith the promise sees, And looks to that alone,
   Laughs at impossibilities, And cries, 'It shall be done.'"

   Sinners also are greatly troubled when they are awakened concerning the
   future. "You will sin again," says Satan, "just as you have done. All
   pretences to a new life will be signal failures. You will go, like the
   dog to his vomit, and return, like the sow that was washed to her
   wallowing in the mire." The quickened mind clearly perceives that this
   would inevitably be the result, if the work were to be performed by
   human strength. But faith denies the slander by looking to the Lord,
   alone. "Though in me, that is in my flesh, there dwells no good thing,
   yet He is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by
   Him."

   And faith clutches that promise, "I give unto My sheep eternal life,
   and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My
   hands." And she looks upon the future with the same eyes of faith with
   which she looks back upon the past and rests herself upon the
   faithfulness and power of God to save. At times these old sins will
   rush in upon the Believer's mind with a terrific force. Gathering
   dreadful strength from the justice of God, our eyes are tormented with
   the vision of an angry God, with His sword drawn, ready to smite us for
   our offenses. Glorious is that faith which can fling itself into the
   arms of God, even when the sword is in His hand, and will not believe
   that God can strike the sinner who relies upon the blood of Jesus!

   Mighty is that faith which, looking at Justice, stern and severe, yet
   trembles not, but cries, "You are merciful and just to forgive me my
   sins, for I have confessed them. Christ has made full Atonement, and
   You will not twice demand the debt. He paid it once, and You cannot lay
   anything to my charge." Triumphant is that faith which marches right up
   to Heaven and stands before the blazing Throne of the great and holy
   God, and yet can cry, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's
   elect? God has justified--who is he that condemns? It is Christ that
   died, yes, rather, that has risen again." And this, even when sin rolls
   like a black flood, and the remembrance of the past has lashed the soul
   to tempest.

   When we really know the blessed merit of Jesus' blood. When we fully
   understand the superlative mercy of God. When we come to know the
   overflowing love of the Father towards His beloved children--we shall
   not look upon sin as being less sin than before, but we shall no longer
   fear its penal consequences, being confidently assured in our soul that
   none of these sins can destroy us. That not the whole of them together
   can for a moment shake our standing in Him, nor by any means put us in
   any danger of eternal wrath, since we are covered with the
   righteousness of Christ, and washed in His blood.

   Brethren, our sins, when pardoned, should increase our delight in God,
   since they afford us evidences of His exceedingly abundant Grace and
   love. Amalie Sieveking, a notable Christian heroine, one of the most
   zealous workers of modern times, writes thus--"The sense of my own
   powerlessness but brings me nearer to Him whose strength is made
   perfect in weakness. I give myself up to His guidance in cheerful trust
   that He will finish the work which He has begun, and help the poor
   stumbling child again and again to rise, yes, should it stumble a
   hundred times a day." And this is the point I want you to
   notice--"Sometimes I feel as though I must lay bare to others the whole
   accumulated amount of my guilt, that they may with me admire the riches
   of Divine long-suffering."

   This is how faith learns to deal with sin--to make it a foil to show
   the brightness of mercy--the setting in which the diamond of Divine
   love flashes with superlative luster. The faithful heart always
   remembers its sin with shame. But still it remembers God's pardoning
   love with gratitude, and the sorrow helps to increase the thankfulness.
   The lower we sink by reason of our sin, the higher our love to God
   rises when we reflect how His strong hand has taken us up "out of the
   horrible pit, and out of the miry clay, and set our feet upon a rock
   and established our goings."

   Oh, I would this morning that some of you who are full of sin would
   believe that Christ can save you! "All things are possible to him that
   believes." What if you are the blackest sinner out of Hell and think
   the devil, himself, white compared with yourself? If you can trust
   Christ this morning, "all things are possible to him that believes."
   Whiter than the newly fallen snow shall you be in an instant, if you
   can now rest your soul upon Jesus, who is able to save.

   2. Let us now observe faith in the midst of those constant attacks of
   which the heir of Heaven is the subject. Here faith, again, does all
   things. My Brethren, no sooner is a Christian born, than there is a
   great stir about him, even as concerning Christ Himself, for Herod
   seeks the young child that he may destroy him. We all know how
   constantly the world attacks us, more especially if we will be separate
   from it, and will keep our garments white, and will not indulge in the
   common pleasures, nor be guided by the ordinary maxims of society. Then
   the world howls at us like a pack of wolves.

   What then? Why, faith finds here but an easy task, for it learns to
   glory in tribulations, delightfully remembering the beatitude of Jesus
   on the mount--"Blessed are you when men shall revile you, and persecute
   you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake.
   Rejoice and be exceedingly glad: for great is your reward in Heaven:
   for so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you." This is an
   everyday conquest with the Christian--to laugh at Satan's threats.
   "This is the victory which overcomes the world, even our faith."

   The world attacks us also with its smiles, and unhappy is the man who
   has no faith, for soon the blandishments of the world will overcome
   him. But he that is full of faith, when the world offers him silver,
   replies, "No, I am rich in gold." And if the world would give him
   treasure, he would say, "I have a better portion than you can offer me.
   Will you tempt a king with farthings, or a prince with beggar's broken
   victuals? I am heir of all things in Christ. This world is mine and
   Heaven is mine, too." So he laughs to scorn all the smiles of the
   wicked, just as he did in the case of their frowns.

   Alas, Brethren, we are equally attacked by the flesh. The lusts within
   are not dead. They are still powerful, and we know it. But here, too,
   faith overcomes. For while faith recognizes the power of the flesh, and
   the lusts thereof, it so lays hold upon Christ that it is lifted up
   into heavenly places, and is able to tread its corruptions under foot.
   Faith says to the Believer, "Be assured that notwithstanding all the
   plagues of your heart, and all the loathsomeness of your nature, yet
   you shall as surely conquer as Christ has conquered. And you shall one
   day be as pure and spotless as even Christ Himself before the Father's
   Throne."

   Up and at your lusts, Believer! There is no sin which will not yield to
   faith. There is no reason that we should always be sinning as we have
   been--we can overcome our lusts. You can drive out these
   Canaanites--though they dwell in cities walled to Heaven, and have
   chariots of iron, you shall put your feet upon their necks, and utterly
   destroy them. By little and by little you may assuredly drive them
   out--but only by faith. Not by works, not by trust in your own moral
   resolutions, but by trust in the sprinkled blood of Jesus, can you
   overcome all temptation and subdue your sins--

   "With my sling and stone I go,
   To fight the Philistine,
   God has said it shall be so,
   And I shall conquer sin.
   On His promise I rely,
   Trust in an Almighty Lord,
   Sure to win the victory,
   For He has spoken the word.
   In the strength of God I rise,
   I run to meet the foe,
   Faith, the word of power applies
   And lays the giant low.
   Faith in Jesus' conquering name,
   Slings the sin-destroying stone,
   Points the Lord's unerring aim,
   And brings the monster down."

   So is it with the devil. The devil comes out against us. But we are
   more than a match for him when our faith is firm. Upon the shield of
   our faith we catch his arrows, and by the sword of our faith we smite
   him to the very heart. There is no temptation that ever can assail a
   Believer but faith can certainly supply an antidote. If I believe in
   Jesus, I have His promise that I shall overcome, and I shall overcome
   because I believe that promise. Even if I should get beneath the
   devil's foot, and he should lift his sword to smite me, if I can say,
   "Rejoice not over me, O my enemy, for when I fall yet shall I rise
   again," I will rise and victory is mine. Faith overcomes even Hell
   itself and its crowned monarch--for defense it is a panoply and for
   attack it is our battleaxe and weapons of war.

   As for the trials of this life, it is marvelous what teachers these are
   to faith, for she perceives that troubles come from God. Chrysostom has
   a gloss upon that passage in Job, where Job says, "The Lord has taken
   away." He did not say the Chaldeans did it, nor the Sabeans, though
   they certainly were the instruments. But the Lord has taken away. The
   Believer, seeing God's hand in everything that happens to him, feels
   pleased with all alike. As Providence is in his Father's hand, he knows
   that it is always guided by love, by wisdom and by Divine Grace.

   And so he thinks his worst days to be as good as his best, his foul
   days are fair, his dark days are bright. In full confidence he believes
   that all things work together for his good, and he leaves the working
   of them entirely with his God. Oh, Beloved, it is only want of faith
   that makes this world such a place of sorrow to God's people--but when
   we get faith, faith laughs at every tribulation--from whatever source
   it may come.

   Thus I have shown you that "all things are possible to him that
   believes." Rise up, O hosts of Hell and shoot your arrows! You heavens,
   prepare your tempests! O earth, cast forth your floods, and You, O
   flesh, come forth with all your blasphemy and wickedness--faith walks
   unharmed amidst all your fury more than conqueror through Him that has
   loved her!

   3. We turn your attention to another point. The obtaining of eminence
   in Divine Grace. Many professed Christians are always doubting and
   fearing and they think that this is the necessary state of Believers.
   By no means, Brothers and Sisters! "All things are possible to him that
   believes." And it is possible for you to get into a state in which a
   doubt or a fear shall be but as a bird of passage flitting across your
   soul, but never lingering there. When you read in biographies of the
   high and sweet communions enjoyed by favored saints you sigh, "Alas,
   these are not for me." Oh climber! If you have but faith, you shall
   stand upon the very pinnacle of the temple--for "all things are
   possible to him that believes."

   I know you read of what some great men have done for Jesus. What they
   have enjoyed of Him. How much they have been like He is. How they have
   been able to endure for His sake. And you say, "Ah, as for me, I am but
   a worm. I can never attain to this." There is nothing which one saint
   was that you may not be. There is no height of Divine Grace, no
   attainment of spirituality, no position, or assurance, no post of duty
   which is not open to you, if you have but the power to believe. Get up,
   get up from your dunghills--lay aside your sackcloth and your ashes--it
   is not meet that you should grovel in the dust, oh children of a King!

   Ascend! The golden throne of assurance is waiting for you! The crown of
   confidence in Jesus is ready to bedeck your brow. Wrap yourself in
   scarlet and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day. For, if you
   believe, all your land shall flow with oil, and wine and milk, and
   honey--your soul shall be as a watered garden and your spirit shall be
   satiated as with marrow and fatness. "All things are possible to him
   that believes."

   4. And yet a fourth point. The power of faith in reference to prayer.
   Here "all things are possible to him that believes." In prayer we are
   sometimes staggered by reason of the great things we are about to ask.
   But faith looks at the great promise, the great God, and His great
   love, and thinks that even a great thing is but a crumb from the
   Master's table. Then, again, we are often driven back by a sense of
   unworthiness. But faith looks at Christ's worthiness and believes that
   His worthiness is quite sufficient to put our unworthiness altogether
   out of court.

   Then we are apt to think of God's delays. But faith thinks that God
   cannot deny, though He may delay--so she hangs on till the promise is
   fulfilled. Though the vision tarries, she waits for it till it comes,
   for sure is she that it will come. And, oh, it is a splendid thing to
   see faith wait upon God in prayer, and forswear all carnal means,
   depending simply and wholly upon the naked promise, and believing that
   God can do His own work and perform His own Word. Brethren, no man
   ought to doubt in these modern times that God will answer prayer, and
   that faith with prayer can do anything.

   We have often heard of George Muller, of Bristol. There stands, in the
   form of those magnificent orphan houses full of orphans, supported
   without committees, without secretaries, supported only by that man's
   prayers and faith--there stands, in solid brick and mortar, a testimony
   to the fact that God hears prayer! But, do you know that Mr. Muller's
   case is but one among many?

   Remember the work of Francke at Halle. Look at the Rough House just out
   of Hamburgh, where Dr. Wichern, commencing with a few reprobate boys of
   Hamburgh, only waiting upon God's help and goodness, has now a whole
   village full of boys and girls, reclaimed and saved--and is sending out
   on the right hand, and on the left, Brethren to occupy posts of
   usefulness in every land.

   Remember the brother Gossner, of Berlin, and how mightily God has
   helped him to send out not less than two hundred missionaries
   throughout the length and breadth of the earth, preaching Christ, while
   he has for their support nothing but the bare promise of God, and faith
   which has learned to reach the hand of God, and take from it all it
   needs.

   And need I remind you of a story we told you last Friday night--the
   story of Pastor Harms, in Hermaunsburg, where, by the power of that
   man's faith in preaching the Word, he has seen the barren wilderness
   made to blossom like the rose. His Church has become a very model of
   what a Church of God ought to be, a living, working body, from which he
   sends out missionaries to the coast of Africa, having nothing for their
   supply but the offerings of the people, drawn from them by the exercise
   of prayer and faith.

   I was reading a memorable passage in his life, where he says, he was
   wanting to send his missionaries out to the Gal-las tribe in Africa but
   could not find any means. And so he says, "Then I knocked diligently on
   the dear God in prayer. And since the praying man dare not sit with his
   hands in his lap, I sought among the shipping agents, but came to no
   speed. And I turned to Bishop Gobat in Jerusalem, but had no answer.
   And then I wrote to the missionary Krapf in Mornbaz, but the letter was
   lost.

   "Then one of the sailors who remained said, 'Why not build a ship and
   you can send out as many, and as often as you will.' The proposal was
   good. But the money! That was a time of great conflict and I wrestled
   with God. For no one encouraged me, but the reverse. And even the true
   friends and Brethren hinted that I was not quite in my senses. When
   Duke George of Saxony lay on his deathbed, and was yet in doubt to whom
   he should flee with his soul, whether to the Lord Christ and His dear
   merits, or to the pope and his good works, there spoke a trusty
   courtier to him--'Your Grace, straightforward makes the best runner.'

   "That word has lain fast in my soul. I had knocked at men's doors and
   found them shut. And yet the plan was manifestly good, and for the
   glory of God. What was to be done? Straightforward makes the best
   runner. I prayed fervently to the Lord, laid the matter in His hand,
   and, as I rose up at midnight from my knees, I said, with a voice that
   almost startled me in the quiet room--Forward now, in God's name! From
   that moment there never came a thought of doubt into my mind."

   Friends, the Churches of Christ have no need of the modern machinery
   which has supplanted the simplicity of faith! I verily believe if the
   Lord swept the committees, secretaries, and missionary societies out of
   the universe, we should be better without them if our Churches would
   but trust God, send out their own men, raise the money to support them,
   and believe that God would bless them. I hope the Church will soon say,
   like David in Saul's clanking armor, "I cannot go with these, for I
   have not tried them," and with only her sling and her stone, confident
   in her God, I trust she will confront her foe. We can do all things, if
   we can but trust Christ.

   "All things are possible to him that believes," but nothing is possible
   to your schemes and to your systems. God will sweep them away, and
   happy shall be that man who shall lead the van in their utter
   destruction. Go up against her, take away her bulwarks, for they are
   not the Lord's. He did not ordain them, nor will He stand by them. Act
   in faith, O you people of God, and prove the power of prayer, for "all
   things are possible to him that believes."

   5. There is another point, upon which I have already entrenched, that
   is, in the service of God "all things are possible to him that
   believes." I know the devil will say to you, "Why, you have no gifts."
   And what if you have not? If you have the gift of faith, you may do
   somewhat and fulfill your mission. Perhaps you are a minister. You have
   been laboring in a village with very little success. Brother, may it
   not be that you did not believe that God would give you success? For if
   you had believed it you would have had it. You are not straitened in
   God, but straitened in your own heart!

   I know what it is to go to my chamber and feel ashamed of many a sermon
   I have preached and moan and groan over it. And I have known what it is
   to discover, within a month, that the sermon has been far more useful
   in conversion than those which I thought had something about them which
   might render them effective. The fact is, God wants not our power but
   our weakness. Not our greatness but our nothingness. Oh, Brother, if
   God has called you to a work that is ten times harder than you have
   strength to perform, go and do it in His strength and "all things are
   possible to him that believes."

   I would that this age would breed a few extravagant men--we are getting
   so dull, so cold, so common-place--we all run in the same cart rut,
   imitating one another. In the sight of one of the heroes of old, we
   little men do walk under their huge legs, and peep about to find
   ourselves dishonorable graves. And all this is because we have left off
   faith. Let a man believe that God has called him to a mission. Let him
   say, "Forward, in God's name!" and that man will carve his name in the
   Rock of Ages and leave memorials behind him which angels shall gaze
   upon when the names of emperors and kings have been swept into
   oblivion.

   Men and Brethren in this Church! Many and many a time have I stirred
   you up to faith, and there are some few of you who begin to know what
   faith means. But, oh, I fear there are many of you still that have not
   come to the fullness of the meaning of faith. To live in a region of
   miracles, to be called fanatics, to see God's hand as visibly as you
   see your own, to recognize Him as greater than second causes, to find
   Him as one whose arm you can move, whose power you can command, to
   stand in an extraordinary position, far above the place where reason
   can put you--to know that you are a distinguished, separated,
   especially-favored child of God--oh, this is Heaven begun below!

   Believe me, I often marvel how people can think that the present
   attainments of the Church are all the Church can expect. I look upon
   decent trades people, respectable ministers, and amiable women, and so
   forth, doing something but doing very, very little--and I am apt to
   say--"What? What? Is this all Christ shed His blood for--to make us do
   this? Is this all the Holy Spirit does, to make a man get through a
   decent sermon on a Sunday? Is this all? Is this God's work? I see God's
   work in nature, and there are towering Alps, and roaring seas, and
   waterfalls lashed to fury. But I look on God's work in the
   Church--little, little, little everywhere. Littleness is stamped upon
   the brow of today. We do not do and dare.

   And I am inclined to think that until we see some great and daring deed
   attempted, and some great and marvelous thing done for Christ, we shall
   not see the glory of the Lord revealed, so that all flesh shall see it
   together. What are we doing here, all of us cooped up in this little
   island, all of us living in England? "The world lies in the Wicked
   One." How is it our hearts beat not for the heathen? We must stay at
   home. We have calls. But is not the call of God louder still, if we had
   but faith? But we are so carnal--we live so much on "the things that
   are seen," that we cannot do a rash, brave, imprudent act for the
   Master.

   God help us to do it! Then shall the Church arise and put on her
   beautiful garments. And woe to you, Askelon, when Israel's God is in
   the camp! Woe to you, Gaza, for your gates shall be carried on our
   shoulders, when once we believe we are strong enough to bear them to
   the top of the hill, posts and bars and all! "All things are possible,"
   in the service of God, "to him that believes."

   Finally, when we shall come to die, sickness shall cause us no anxiety.
   The solemn mysteries of the last article shall give us no alarm. The
   grave shall be no place of gloom. Judgment shall know no
   terrors--eternity shall have no horrors. For to him that believes, all
   things are possible, and death and death's shade give way before faith.
   Heaven yields to faith. Hell trembles at it. Earth is powerless before
   it and lies in the hand of the faithful man, like clay upon the
   potter's wheel, to be molded as he wills.

   II. I come to my last point and may God bless it. WHERE LIES, THEN, THE
   SECRET STRENGTH OF FAITH? It lies in the food it feeds on. For faith
   studies what the promise is--an emanation of Divine Grace, an
   overflowing of the great heart of God. And faith says, "My God could
   not have given this promise, except from love and Grace. Therefore it
   is quite certain that this promise will be fulfilled." Then faith
   thinks, "Who gave this promise?" It considers not so much its
   greatness, as "Who is the Author of it?"

   She remembers that it is God, that cannot lie--God Omnipotent, God
   Immutable. And therefore she concludes that the promise must be
   fulfilled. And forward she goes in this firm conviction. Then she
   remembers, also, why the promise was given--namely, for God's glory,
   and she feels perfectly sure that God's glory is safe--that He will
   never stain His own escutcheon, nor mar the luster of His own crown.
   And therefore she concludes that the promise must and will stand.

   Then faith also considers the amazing work of Christ as being a clear
   proof of the Father's intention to fulfill His word. "He that spared
   not His own Son but freely delivered Him up for us all, how shall He
   not with Him also freely give us all things?" Then faith looks back
   upon the past, for her battles have strengthened her, and her victories
   have given her courage. She remembers that God never has failed her.
   No, that He never did once fail any of His children. She recollects
   times of great peril, when deliverance came--hours of awful need, when
   as her day, her strength was. And she says, "No. I never will be led to
   think that He can now forswear and change His Character and leave His
   servant.

   Faith, moreover, feels that she cannot believe a hard thing of her dear
   God. Is it wrong to use that expression? I must use it, for He is dear
   to me! I think this is one of the things I have repented of above all
   other sins I have committed--the sin of ever doubting Him who loves me
   so well that He had sooner die than I should perish, and did die that I
   might live. What? That God so dear to my soul--do I doubt Him? I would
   not spread a report that my father was a liar, or that my mother would
   forswear herself. No, blessed parents, you would not be unkind to me.

   And, my blessed God, my faith knows that You cannot be unkind--our love
   will make You faithful even if your faithfulness were not enough in
   itself. If our God can leave us, then indeed am I mistaken in His
   Character. If I can dare something for God, and He can leave me, then
   have I misread Scripture. I do not believe, young warrior, if God shall
   prompt you to dash into the thick of the battle, that He will leave
   you, as Joab did Uriah, to fall by the arrows of the enemy. Only dare
   it, and God will be greater than your daring. But we refuse to be
   honorable. A little hardship, a little difficulty, a little danger, and
   we shrink back to our ignoble sloth. Oh that we would rise to the glory
   of believing!

   Dearly Beloved, I have tried thus to stir up your souls. But I am very
   conscious that we cannot have this faith in Christ, except as we have
   more of His Holy Spirit. But then we have the promise--"If you, being
   evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more
   shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?"
   Ask for more faith. This Church is enough of itself for the conversion
   of the whole world, if God will give us faith enough. If the little
   band at Jerusalem were all that was wanted, a band of more than two
   thousand faithful men and women might be enough, if we had faith.

   And look at all the Churches around--would their success be as little
   as it is, if they had more faith? All things are possible, and yet we
   do nothing! Everything within our reach, and yet we are poor! Heaven
   itself on our side, and yet we are defeated! Shameful unbelief, be you
   put to death forever! Glorious faith, live you in our souls! I hope
   that both sinner and saint will believe in the mercy and goodness and
   Truth of God, as revealed in Christ, and that we will take this home
   with us for today's meal--"All things are possible to him that
   believes."--

   "Faith treads on the world and on Hell; It vanquishes death and
   despair. And, O!Let us wonder to tell, It o vercomes Heaven byprayer--
   Bids sins of a crimson-like dye Be spotless as snow and as white-- And
   raises the sinner on high To dwell with the angels of light."

                                 Self-Delusion

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 19, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in and shall not be able."
   Luke 13:24.

   EVERY wise merchant will occasionally hold a stock-taking, when he will
   cast up his accounts, examine what he has on hand, and ascertain
   decisively whether his trade is prosperous or declining. Every man who
   is wise in the kingdom of Heaven, will do the same by himself. He will
   cry, "Search me, O God and try me." And he will frequently set apart
   special seasons for self-examination, to discover whether things are
   right between God and his soul. The God whom we worship is a great
   heart-searcher.
   Of old His servants knew Him as, "the Lord which searches the heart and
   tries the reins of the children of men."

   We who are called to be the mouth for God unto the people feel
   ourselves impelled to stir you up in His name to make diligent search,
   for we would not have you come short of the promised rest. We should be
   unfaithful to your souls if we did not warn you against deception, and
   excite you to solemn trial of your state. That which every wise man
   does, that which God Himself does with you, I may well exhort you to do
   with yourselves this morning.

   may God help you to deal very faithfully with your own hearts. Let the
   oldest Saint here look well to the fundamentals of his piety, for gray
   heads may cover black hearts. And let not the young Believer, in the
   first flush of his joyous faith, despise the word of warning, for the
   greenness of youth may be joined to the rottenness of hypocrisy.

   1 shall not, this morning, aim to introduce doubts and fears into your
   minds. No, verily, I rather hope that the rough winds of
   self-examination may help to drive them away. It is not security, but
   carnal security, which we would kill. Not confidence, but fleshly
   confidence, which we would overthrow. Not peace, but false peace which
   we would destroy. I am sure I am right in taking such a text as this,
   and in desiring to force it home upon your attention. For Christ,
   speaking to His own disciples, says, "I say unto YOU."

   Notice with great care how He repeats the personal pronoun, you, you,
   yourselves, some twelve times in a few verses. As if this were a matter
   especially belonging to professors--a subject which ought to come under
   our immediate notice, not as having reference to aliens and foreigners
   from the commonwealth of Israel, but to us, the professed followers of
   Jesus.

   Let us bow our strength to our solemn work at once. O great Master of
   assemblies, make our words as goads to the conscience, and fasten them
   as nails in the memory!

   I. Our first remark is this--MANY PROFESSORS ABE DECEIVED. So the text
   teaches us. It does not say, "a few may be misled," but "many shall
   seek to enter in, and shall not be able." That many professors are
   deceived is clear enough from the language of Christ Himself, both here
   and in other places. For instance, "Then shall the kingdom of Heaven be
   likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps and went forth to meet
   the bridegroom. And five of them were wise and five were foolish."

   We hope that in our Churches we have not such a division as this! It
   were a fearful thing to contemplate only one half as sincere, and the
   other half graceless, having the lamp of profession, without the secret
   vessel of spiritual life! Yet, so alarming a proportion as five out of
   ten should make us search ourselves very carefully, lest we are found
   among the virgins, and among the virgins having lamps, yes, and among
   those whose lamps are burning--and yet should be cast away as having no
   oil in our vessels!

   Remember how the Master in another parable puts the multitude of the
   lost clearly before us--"When the Son of Man shall come in His glory
   and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the Throne of
   His glory: and before Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall
   separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from
   the goats: and He shall set the sheep on His right hand but the goats
   on the left." Now, by these goats are meant those who are in the flock
   but are not sheep.

   A separation is needed, for they once were mingled. Yes, so mingled
   that they had a sort of hope, and were able impudently to plead--"Lord,
   when did we see You hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or
   sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto You?" Yet I do not
   discover in the parable that there were more sheep than goats. I find,
   at any rate, that the goats did make up a very considerable multitude.
   And though they expected to receive the benediction with the blessed,
   He said, "Depart from Me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
   for the devil and his angels."

   Remember, also, another parable of our Savior, where the sower went
   forth to sow his seed. Here there were three places where the seed fell
   in vain, and only one where it brought forth fruit. And, out of the
   three where it fell in vain, there were two that must be numbered with
   professors. In the one case it fell where the thorns sprang up and
   choked it-- there was religion but worldliness killed it. In the next,
   it fell where there was not much depth of earth. And the Master tells
   us that there are some who hear the Word and with joy receive it. But
   when persecution comes by-and-by, they are offended, for there was
   never a deep work in their inner spirit.

   Tremble, my Hearers, so many of you as have received the Word with joy
   and gladness, lest you should be found to have had no depth of earth
   and so, by-and-by, the good things which have blossomed and budded in
   you should perish before the burning sun of persecution.

   Nor are these parables so few. I might occupy much of your time by
   recalling them. But let me remind you that Christ Himself is compared
   by Malachi to a refiner. "He shall purify the sons of Levi. He shall be
   like a refiner's fire and like a fuller's soap." Now, of the mass that
   is put into the refining furnace, how little comes out pure gold or
   silver? All those who have to deal with metals will tell you that the
   ore and the slag make up, by far, the greater part, and that if they
   get but a small percentage, they are well rewarded for all their toil
   and trouble.

   The Master says He will bring a third part through the fire, and happy
   should it be for us, if we are not found among the two-thirds that
   shall be put away like dross. You will remember, too, that Christ
   compares Himself to a farmer winnowing his corn. "Whose fan is in His
   hand and He will thoroughly purge His floor and gather His wheat into
   the garner. But He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire." Ask
   the farmer whether the chaff does not make a very considerable part of
   the unwinnowed mass, and whether it is not most intimately connected
   with the wheat.

   A large heap, it lies upon the floor--wait till the fan has been used
   and diligently applied and you shall see the heap diminished by
   handfuls, for the chaff has fled, and now only the good grain is left.
   All these metaphors, and many more, go to warn us that there are many
   professors who are deceived--many that are in Israel, who are not of
   Israel. Many that are mingled with us, who, like the mixed multitude
   which came up out of Egypt with Moses, shall never enter into the
   promised land, but shall leave their carcasses to perish in the
   wilderness.

   But, dear Friends, we are not left to inferences, for Holy Scripture
   gives us facts. Let me recall them to your recollection. Among the
   Apostles themselves, chosen by Christ, having Christ for their teacher
   and exemplar, there was a Judas. "I have chosen you twelve, and one of
   you is a devil." Were it very reasonable to suppose that our modern
   Churches have a smaller proportion than this of devilish deceivers? If
   even among Apostles, one in twelve is a liar, deceiving, and being
   deceived, O Lord, how should

   Your people search and try themselves, lest they be found wanting at
   the last!

   Remember, too, that in the early Church, within a few days after the
   Spirit of God had been poured out, when that Church was in the
   overflowing joy of her espousals, there were found two at least who
   were false to their profession. Ananias and Sapphira "lied unto the
   Holy Spirit," and fell dead before the rebuke of Peter. If, with the
   Spirit just poured out, there were spots in their solemn feasts. If in
   the first glory of the Church's sky there were wandering stars to whom
   is reserved the blackness and darkness forever, how much more in these
   days of the Church's weakness, when we have need enough to cry,
   "Descend, O sacred fire, descend again. For without You Your Church
   shall die"?

   The Book of the Acts of the Apostles also informs us of an instance of
   a wonderful success in the city of Samaria. And yet even here, among
   the early converts of this revival, there was found an arch-impostor.
   Philip the Evangelist preaches in Samaria and it is written, "Then
   Simon Magus believed also." But you know how false he was. For Peter
   said, "Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the
   Holy Spirit can be purchased with money." "I perceive that you are in
   the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity."

   Well, if in one of the earliest of revivals, when converts were
   numerous, when miracles abounded, when the whole city was full of
   joy--we still find a Simon Magus--what must we expect now? And,
   Brethren, I scarcely need to remind you, that with Paul as an overseer
   of the Church, the cases of deception and apostasy were not few. "All
   they which are in Asia are turned away from me, among whom are
   Phygellus and Hermogenes." "Demas has forsaken me." "Alexander the
   coppersmith did me much evil."

   Hymenaeus and Alexander having made shipwreck of faith, the Apostle
   says, "Whom I have delivered unto Satan that they may learn not to
   blaspheme." Philetus is mentioned, "Who has strayed according to the
   truth." I say, there were even in such Churches as the Galatians--men
   who were accursed because they preached another Gospel. And in the
   Church of Corinth there were found evil ones who had to be cast out of
   the assembly. Moreover, Brethren, you will remember that the Lord Jesus
   Christ, Himself, gives no flattering character of the seven Churches in
   Asia, though they were like seven golden candlesticks.

   Of the best of them He might say, "I have somewhat against you." Of
   Sardis it is said, "You have a few names even in Sardis which have not
   defiled their garments." And of Laodicea, you will remember it was,
   "neither cold nor hot, so that Christ did spew it out of His mouth."
   Put these things together, and you will see they make up a mass of
   hypocrisy and deception in the most favorable age of the Church's
   history. And we therefore think ourselves far from an uncharitable
   judgment when we expect to find in the Church of today many that are
   deceived. But, friends, I need not argue thus. For we know that there
   are such, and know it to our shame.

   Every now and then a cedar falls in our midst. "Howl fir trees," when
   the cedars fall. We have seen--who has not, that has had any experience
   in the religious world?--we have seen our leaders turn their backs in
   the day of battle. And our teachers fail to sustain their own
   character. Ah, and we have the painful conviction that there are others
   who are not discovered yet, whose sins do not go beforehand unto
   judgment but follow after, who are nevertheless tainted at the core.
   There are the many covetous professors who are as grasping and as
   grinding as if they never professed to be Christians.

   And you know that "covetousness is idolatry." There are the many
   time-serving Christians who hold with the world and with Christ, too.
   And you know that we cannot serve two masters. There are the many
   secret sinners among Christians who have their petty vices which come
   not under human observation, and who, because they are thought to be
   good, write themselves down among the godly. Now we know there is
   nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and woe to them when their
   secret sins shall be published on the housetops!

   Then we have the legal professors who trust to their own works, and
   shall find that the curse of Sinai shall wither them. And what more
   shall I say? Have we not many who are not so inconsistent that we could
   put our finger upon any open sin sufficient to deserve excommunication,
   but who are guilty of enormous spiritual wickedness? They are dead,
   they bring forth no fruit. Their hearts are hard as a millstone with
   regard to the conversion of sinners.

   They have not the faith of God's elect. They do not live by faith. They
   have not the spirit of Christ, and therefore they are none of His. God
   knows we have sought to use all care and diligence in this Church, both
   to keep out unworthy persons, and to cast out unhallowed livers. But,
   despite all that, we cannot but be conscious, and we tell it to you
   faithfully, that the enemy still continues to sow tares among the
   wheat. The gold is mixed with the dross, and the wine with wa-ter--for
   evil men thrust themselves into the heritage of the Lord.

   When our muster-roll shall be revised at last, how many out of our more
   than two thousand members will be found to be base-born pretenders unto
   godliness! O my Brethren, I implore you by the precious blood of
   Christ, which was not shed to make you hypocrites, but shed that a
   sincere people might show forth His praise--I beseech you, search and
   look, lest at the last it be said of you--"Mene, Mene Tekel, you are
   weighed in the balances and found wanting."

   II. We shall now turn to a second point. IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT
   THERE ARE FALSE PROFESSORS.

   There is an imitation of the externals of godliness which is not easy
   to detect. Art can carve a statue so that it almost breathes. And some
   of us, in looking at very skillful paintings, have mistaken them for
   realities. In a notable picture in the Exhibition, you will have
   noticed an imitation of sunlight shining under a door so well painted
   that many go up to it to ascertain if it is not really a gleam from the
   sun. We know that men can counterfeit coins and notes so well that only
   the most experienced can detect them.

   And in all commercial transactions men are so well aware of the
   subtlety of their fellows, that they look well lest they are deceived.
   The vital mysteries of godliness are mysterious--the inner life cannot
   be perceived by the carnal eye, and the outer life of the godly seems
   to most men to be but morality carried out with care. And therefore it
   becomes but a very simple task for a man to make himself look just like
   a Christian, so as to deceive the very elect. To learn by heart that
   which others say from the heart--to get the outline of a Believer's
   experience and then to adapt it skillfully to one's self as our
   experience--this is a thing so simple that instead of wondering that
   there are hypocrites, I often marvel that there are not ten times more!

   And then, again, the Graces--the real Graces within--even they are very
   easy to counterfeit. There is a repentance that needs to be repented
   of--and yet it approaches as near as possible to true repentance. Does
   repentance make men hate sin? They who have a false repentance may
   detest some crimes. Does repentance make men resolve that they will not
   sin? So will this false repentance. For Balaam said, "If Barak would
   give me his house full of silver and gold, I will not go beyond the
   word of the Lord."

   Does true repentance make men humble themselves? So does false
   repentance. For Ahab humbled himself before God, and yet he perished.
   There is a line of distinction so fine that an eagle's eye has not seen
   it, and only God Himself, and the soul which is enlightened with His
   Spirit, can tell whether this repentance is genuine or not. And as for
   faith, how easy it is to counterfeit this! Even in Christ's day there
   was a faith which worked miracles, but did not save the soul. And Paul
   tells us that if we had a faith which could remove mountains, yet if we
   had not charity, it would profit us nothing.

   I know it, that a man may say that he is saved by faith without works.
   And his faith may give him comfort, his faith help him in trials, it
   may make him forsake some sins, and yet it may not be the faith which
   looks alone to Christ and so saves the soul. To imitate these things,
   to so cunning and well-practiced a counterfeiter as Satan, is no great
   difficulty.

   Dear Friends, let us remember, too, that there are so many things which
   help a man to deceive himself. He himself is naturally disposed to be
   very partial. "Let well enough alone," is a proverb which most men have
   learned. Very few men care to look at the worst of their own state.
   They would rather say, "Peace, peace," than think too harshly of
   themselves. What man ever gave himself a bad character? Or if he did,
   what man could not abundantly excuse himself for having such a
   character?

   Then there is the devil who never wants us to be too careful, for
   heedlessness is one of the nets in which he takes his prey. He will
   whisper in the ear, "It is all well," and so beguile the simple soul to
   its sure ruin. Beside that, there are the inconsistencies of true
   Christians. Self and Satan will always use these. "Why, you are as good
   as old So-and-So." Or, "David sinned, therefore you may be a saint and
   sin. Lot fell, therefore you may fall and be a saint." And so, what
   with the flesh, what with the sins of true Christians, and what with
   the devil, it is easy for a man to fall asleep in carnal security,
   dreaming about Heaven, and never having his dream broken till he lifts
   up his eyes in Hell.

   Beloved, I must add to this point, that I marvel not that so many are
   deceived, when I see the careless way in which you deal with religion.
   When men have to do with their estates, they are very careful--they
   retain a lawyer to go back over the title-deeds perhaps for two or
   three hundred years. In trade they will hurry here and there to attend
   to their commercial engagements. They would not launch into
   speculations, nor would they run great risks.

   But the soul, the poor soul--how men play with it as a toy and despise
   it as if it were worthless earth! Two or three minutes in the morning,
   when they first roll out of bed. Two or three odd minutes in the
   evening, when they are nearly asleep--the ends of the day given to
   their souls--and all the best part given to the body! And then, the
   Sunday! How carelessly spent by most people! With what indifference do
   you lend your ears too often to the preaching of the Word! It is an old
   song. You have heard it so many times. Heaven has become a trifle to
   you. Hell is almost a jest. Eternity a notion, and death but a bugbear.

   Alas, alas! It is a marvel that there are not more deceived. The wonder
   is that any find the gate--that any discover eternal life--when we are
   so, so mad, so foolish, so insane, as to trifle where we ought to be
   awfully in earnest, and to play and toy where the whole heart is all
   too little to be given to a work of such dread, such everlasting
   importance! God help us, since it is so easy to be deceived, to search
   and watch, and look and test, that we are not found castaways at the
   last!

   III. But now for a third point and that is a very solemn one, namely,
   that THIS DELUSION MAY CONTINUE

   THROUGHOUT LIFE, even to the very last moment. And probably the first
   minutes of our life in the next world may be tinctured with the same
   delusion.

   Strange to think so, and yet some Scriptures seem to hint as much. Let
   me tell you one or two parables which Christ has used, which prove that
   this delusion may last long. There are the Tares and the Wheat--"Let
   both grow together until the harvest." It appears that the time of
   division does not arrive until the reapers, who are the angels, gather
   together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn. So, you see,
   you may stand in a professing state through your whole threescore years
   and ten, and you may be carried to your grave, followed by a train of
   devout men, who make great lamentation over you.

   And yet, though laid in the grave like a sheep, the worm may devour
   you, and you may wake in the morning to shame and everlasting contempt.
   The separation may never occur, so far as the Church on earth is
   concerned. It may go on till the angelic revisers shall correct the
   list and cut you off who are not of God.

   Another parable--the Draw Net repeats the same warning, "The kingdom of
   Heaven is like unto a net that is cast into the sea and gathers of
   every kind." When does the division come? Not till they have drawn the
   net to land. Then they put the good into vessels, and throw the bad
   away. So not till the land comes--that is, till eternity has begun,
   shall be the great division. And some of you may remain in the net of
   the Church till it is pulled ashore at the Day of Judgment, and we may
   some of us be expecting to find you in the vessels--and yet you will be
   thrown away. Or we may expect ourselves to be there and yet ourselves
   may be thrown away.

   I refer you again to another parable, where the same Truth of God is
   taught but, perhaps, even more forcibly. A great king made a supper,
   and it is said, "When the king came in to see the guests, he saw there
   a man which had not on a wedding garment: and he said unto him, Friend,
   how came you in here?" Here was a man who remained in the kingdom, that
   is in the visible Church--till the king came in to see the guests--that
   is until Christ comes to judge the quick and dead. Then was he cast
   out, but not till then.

   Many postpone all trial of themselves as to their possession of the
   righteousness of Christ to the last moment. No, some manage to defer
   it, with all the miserable discoveries which it brings, until the grave
   is past, and the great assize is held, but further the lie cannot be
   played--further the examination cannot be deferred. When Jesus comes,
   it will be impossible for any to remain ignorant of their true state,
   for that day will pour a flood of light into the dark corners of the
   dark hearts and reveal the most secret of all secret things.

   Solemn reflection! Solemn reflection for every man and woman here who
   has made a profession of godliness! You may he sitting at the table,
   and you may continue to sit there without any of your fellow guests
   taking any exception to you. But when the King comes in, whose eyes can
   read the secrets of all hearts, He will say, "How came you in here, not
   having on a wedding garment?" Then will your nakedness and defilement
   startle you from your fancied security!

   Speechless confusion shall cover you. Your heart shall find no excuse,
   the sentence shall bear justice on its forefront. "Bind him hand and
   foot." Let resistance and escape be made impossible. "Cast him into
   outer darkness," for he shunned the light. "There shall be weeping and
   gnashing of teeth"--fit doom for one who would not weep nor search his
   soul.

   Sundry other parables utter same warning notes, but I shall quote only
   one more and that is, the Unprofitable Servant. He was a servant, and
   remained so. And he had the impudence to present himself among the
   other servants to receive the reward. Yes, and when he had no reward,
   he had the impertinence to argue with his Master and to claim that he
   had done his best with his Lord's money. You may have a talent--and,
   oh, how many of you have--which you are burying in the earth.

   And you may never be upbraided by your fellow servants. But when He
   comes, you may, with brazen face, go up to ask for your reward but He
   shall say, "Take the unprofitable servant!" And you know what the doom
   of such must be. Therefore, from Christ's own language, we have the
   most satisfactory and solemn cause to believe that the delusion of many
   may continue even to the last. The blindness of the self-deceiver may
   continue until he finds himself in the tenfold night of eternal
   perdition.

   But we need not go to Scripture for a proof of this, for we know that
   it is so ourselves. We have not an exact way of testing men's
   states--it were foolish to pretend to infallibility--but there are
   times when one can form a very accurate guess, the door of man's heart
   now and then stands on the jar. Deathbeds tell tales. It is not every
   man who has the hardihood to dance with death, and wear a mask upon the
   brink of the grave. Ah, how many there are who go through the first and
   the second gate, but they cannot open the iron gate that leads into the
   City.

   I have seen some that could brave it out when in life, who have made a
   sorry figure in the article of death. It is a gloomy thing to hear a
   high professor, after all his boastings, compelled to condemn himself
   out of his own mouth--"I have been a hypocrite, I have sat at the
   Lord's Table, and I have drunk the cup of devils, too. I was respected,
   when I was not respectable. I was accepted among Saints, when I was a
   foul villain the whole while."

   Some men have had to hang in chains before their execution. Some
   wretches lift up their eyes before they are actually in torment. But
   there have been others, more stolid still, who have gone right through
   the iron gate, with perfect quietness and calmness. And when we have
   heard their friends say, "Oh, he died such an easy death!" we have
   remembered that passage concerning the wicked, "There are no bands in
   their death--but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as
   other men, neither are they plagued like other men."

   This is the mark of the wicked, not of the righteous. O that sullen
   quietude, that dead calm, in which some men float into another world!
   How wretched that awful peace which heralds the overwhelming tempest
   and hurricane! Have I not watched the spirits of unregenerate
   professors, and seen the ghastly horror of the dread suspense which
   they labored to conceal. Not that their lives were inconsistent, but
   they had no spiritual life--no care for souls, no love for Christ, no
   private prayer, no secret fellowship with Him. And now, at last, they
   have no triumph, and no comfort of the Spirit.

   When their time has come to die, they have talked as glibly as any, and
   they have closed their eyes as peacefully as any, but, like Dives, "In
   Hell they have lifted up their eyes, being in torment," and found their
   delusion dissipated, when, alas, it was too late. I warn you, dear
   Hearers, that delusion may continue for even fifty, sixty, or seventy
   years. You may say, "It is all well with my soul," and have neither
   doubt nor fear the whole time--and yet you may turn out rotten at the
   last.

   The glorious Dreamer has sketched the end of the false professor. I
   quote his words, that you may see the scene before your eyes. "Now
   while I was gazing upon all these things, I turned my head to look back
   and saw Ignorance come up to the riverside. But he soon got over, and
   that without that difficulty which the other two men met with. For it
   happened that there was then in that place, one Vainhope, a ferryman,
   that with his boat helped him over. So he, as the others I saw, did
   ascend the hill, to come up to the gate, only he came alone. Neither
   did any men meet him with the least encouragement.

   "When he was come up to the gate, he looked up to the writing that was
   above, and then began to knock, supposing that entrance should have
   been quickly administered to him. But he was asked by the men that
   looked over the top of the gate, Where did you come from? And what do
   you want? He answered. I have eaten and drank in the presence of the
   King, and He has taught in our streets. Then they asked him for his
   certificate, that they might go in and show it to the King. So he
   fumbled in his bosom for one and found none.

   "Then said they, Have you none? But the man answered never a word. So
   they told the King, but He would not come down to see him but commanded
   the two Shining Ones that conducted Christian and Hopeful to the city,
   to go out and take Ignorance and bind him hand and foot and take him
   away. Then they took him up and carried him through the air to the door
   that I saw in the side of the hill and put him in there. Then I saw
   that there was a way to Hell, even from the gates of Heaven, as well as
   from the City of Destruction."

   IV. The next point is this--that this delusion, even to the last, MAY
   SEEM TO HAVE THE MOST EXCELLENT ARGUMENTS TO SUPPORT IT. I shall prove
   this from Scripture. A man may be a deceiver, and he may accomplish his
   task all the more readily because he can say, "I have made, and I have
   maintained a very respectable profession in the Church. I do not know
   that I have ever tarnished my character. I believe I am looked upon by
   most people as a pattern and example."

   Yes, this may be all correct, and yet you may be shut out at the last.
   Remember that the five foolish virgins were virgins. They had not
   forfeited the chastity of their character, but were of such good repute
   as to have virtuous companions, and to have allowance to meet the
   honored bridegroom. They had lamps. Mark that. I do not find that they
   threw them away. Those lamps were burning, too, for a long time. And
   they had some oil, mark, or else the lamps could not have burned so
   long.

   But they had not the oil in the vessel, though they had the oil in the
   lamp. Here was the fatal blunder. So the man may say, "Well, I am all
   right. The lamp burns. Does it not burn as well as yours? You, you say
   have other oil in your vessel. That does not matter. I have as much oil
   in my lamp as you. Mine shines as brightly. I am careful with it. And
   if I sleep, you sleep too--so that I have as decent a profession as you
   have." And yet, for all this, God may at the last rend you in pieces,
   and there shall be none to deliver you. How often is the candle of the
   wicked put out, and his beauty utterly consumed.

   Again, some may bring a very careful outward observance of religion as
   an excellent argument, and think the conclusion to be drawn is very
   satisfactory. "Lord, we have eaten and drank in Your presence and You
   have preached in our streets." You have been baptized. You are always
   at the Lord's Table. Your pew always sees you in it whenever the doors
   are opened. All this is very proper and right. But it may all help to
   make you more easily deceived. You may conclude that you must be right
   because of this. And yet, the Master may say, "I never knew you."

   If means of Divine Grace could raise men to Heaven, Capernaum would not
   have been cast down to Hell. If attendance at the temple could save the
   soul, then Caiaphas would be in Glory. If hearing the Word would be
   enough, then Herod would be in Heaven. O Brethren, more than this you
   must have, or you will miss everlasting life! Further, you may even go
   the length of manifesting much religious activity, and you may conclude
   from this that it must be all right with you--as those did who said,
   "In Your name we have done many wonderful works."

   We may have been preachers and have converted our hundreds and
   attracted our thousands. We may have been Sunday school teachers and
   led our little ones to Christ. We may have been missionaries, whose
   names have been applauded at the public meeting. But, for all that, we
   may be found castaways at the last. For it is not the doing of mighty
   works, but vital union with Christ by real faith, which shall be the
   point that shall decide the question.

   O Friends, your preaching, praying, almsgiving, tract
   distributing--unless Divine Grace is in you--only help you in your
   delusion, and make it the more difficult to arouse you from it. The
   more diligent in service the self-deceiver becomes, the more strong is
   the net in which his foot is taken. Every duty performed may be but
   another fetter to bind our souls if we are graceless professors. O that
   I could awaken you, you desperately bewitched and stupefied deceivers!

   Dear Friends, even the righteousness of God may furnish us with a plea
   if we choose our own delusions, and from every holy thing we may fetch
   apologies. We may say, "Religion is very hard. God is very strict and
   severe. Nobody can carry it out as he should. Therefore it will be well
   with me." Just as he said, "Lord, I knew that you were an austere man,
   gathering where you had not scattered seed, and reaping where you had
   not sown." And so, knowing that we are not what we should be, we may
   keep up our delusion by the excuse that there are very few who are, and
   that God is a hard master.

   And so we may go on, keeping our eyes fast shut, till the flames of
   Hell shall wake us up to sleep and dream no more. I know some who will
   even make it an excuse that they did not know what religion required of
   them, and they will plead ignorance. "It is true," they will say, "I
   have not done as I should, but I did not know about it." Just as they
   did on the left hand. "When saw we You hungry and fed You not, or
   thirsty, and gave You no drink?" "I did not know," says the man, "that
   Christ was on earth. I knew there was a parcel of poor people about
   that many despised and called fanatics. I did not suppose that feeding
   them would have been feeding Christ. I did not know Christ."

   "No," says Christ, "and I do not know you. Depart from Me, you workers
   of iniquity, for I never knew you." Ah, Beloved, if you will be
   deceived, it is the easiest task in the world to accomplish your
   purpose. Any fool can delude himself. It needs no wise, and
   persevering, and patient man to invent a method by which to drag his
   soul into a damnable delusion. This can be done by sitting still. If
   you would be saved, you must "strive to enter in at the narrow gate."
   But if you would be damned, there is no striving wanted. It is only a
   little matter of neglect, and the whole is done. "How shall we escape,
   if we neglect so great a salvation?"

   V. And now to the last point--this delusion may last through life and
   be sustained by many specious arguments but IT MUST ALL BE DISPELLED.
   Ah, if this pretty dreaming could last forever--if the man could have
   hope forever-- then I need not be earnest with you this morning. But
   since it must be dispelled, hear me! Hear me, Men and Brethren, while
   briefly I utter a few solemn warnings!

   Remember, Professor, you will then be all alone. There will be no
   minister to comfort you--no deacons and Church members to say you have
   maintained a good profession. You will have then to look at your own
   acts, your own faith, and your own life, in the solemn privacy of
   eternity. And then you will give the right verdict, if you do not now.
   Then, too, your conscience will be awake. You would give a thousand
   worlds if you could make it sleep then, for conscience is "the worm" of
   Hell and it "dies not."

   It is the fire that can never be quenched.

   Then you will not be able to satisfy conscience with pretences, nor
   with promises. It will gnaw and bite and devour and vex you. The fury
   of its fire will consume once and for all your proud conceits, and
   comfortable fancies. Then, too, your mind shall be more sensitive than
   it is now. Now you think little of Hell or Heaven, time or eternity.
   But then those words will stick like daggers in you. You will feel,
   then, that the soul was of importance--no, that it was all-important.

   You will then be made to feel those themes which now only enter your
   ears and are forgotten. There will be no cups in which to drown your
   thoughts, no theatres in which to dissipate your melancholy, no gay
   company in which to laugh or talk away the impressions of the Sunday.
   There will be no chance, then, of laughing at the minister, or
   pacifying your conscience about these things. But your sensitive soul,
   wounded in every point, shall be made to cry aloud, and never shall its
   cries cease, for then you shall be lost, lost, lost forever!

   Then your knowledge shall increase, and you shall know what you know
   not now, and all you know shall only make your folly appear the more
   folly, because when there was hope you despised it, and when Christ was
   preached to you, you were content with the counterfeit, and despised
   the reality. But hear me--hear me once again, Man! Then God shall deal
   with you. Now it is only my poor voice. It is only my feeble utterance
   that goes to your heart today, and you will forget it all. Or perhaps
   you do not feel it now. But when God deals with you, it will be another
   thing.

   Oh, if I were a Baxter, I would preach my sermon out in tears and weep
   over you proud and high Professors that will not search and examine
   yourselves whether you are in the faith! But if I cannot get at you,
   God will. Those eyes of fire shall shed a light into the dark corners
   of your soul. That finger shall find out the leprous spots which now
   you have so well concealed. His hand shall rip open your breast, to
   look at your heart, and expose it to the assembled universe. As sure as
   God shall deal with you, so would I have you surely deal with God. Make
   sure work for eternity. Pull it down, pull it down, if it is built on
   the sand! Consume it, consume it, if it is "wood, hay, stubble," and
   cry to God this day that you may build upon the Rock and use nothing
   but "gold, silver and precious stones," that your building may abide
   the fire.

   Sinners! A word to you. If the Professor, "if the righteous scarcely
   are saved," where will you appear? Drunkard, surely you shall drink the
   cup of wrath! Swearer! Surely you shall have your "damns" and your
   "anathemas" replayed into your soul abundantly! Thief! You shall find
   that you have stolen your own soul! Harlot! Whoremonger! You shall find
   at the last that God abhors you, and He will cast you from His
   Presence. I say, if even the best living of men need thus to search and
   try, and if many of them shall be shut out, careless Sinners, what must
   then, become of you?

   And you timid ones--you timid Christians! I have not preached this to
   alarm you. Let me bid you, however--fly to Jesus again this morning. If
   there is all this ado, when we come to sift and try, would it not be
   better for you and me to cling to the Cross again, with, "Just as I am,
   I trust You, Jesus--I trust You alone." For oh, remember, none can
   perish that are clinging to the Cross!

   But, proud Professors! The last word must still be for you. You may
   soar, yes, like Icarus, with wings of wax, but the higher you fly, the
   more terrible will be your fall. And what will become of you? Think of
   what has become of others like you, now in Hell! What would they give
   for your Sabbaths over again? What would they give to be here, that
   they might hear one faithful sermon--that they might repent and escape
   from the wrath of God? Think, while you are here, how they are cursing
   themselves to think that they threw away the golden hour and lost the
   opportunity! How they gnaw their tongues, while they say, "I came from
   the table of God to the place of fiends. I came from the pulpit into
   Hell. I descended from Mount Zion to the very depths of Hades. I was
   brought from Jerusalem to Tophet."

   And this is to be your lot, proud Professor! Unless you repent. What do
   you say, Man? Are you willing to make your bed in Hell, after having
   talked of leaning your head on Jesus' bosom? What? Will you dwell with
   everlasting burnings, after having sung of everlasting love? What? Must
   you be driven from His Presence, when you have boasted of being
   justified by His righteousness, and washed in His blood? It must be so,
   Professor. It must be so, unless God helps you to make true work, and
   real work, and sure work of it by the Holy Spirit.

   "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved. For he that
   believes and is baptized shall be saved. He that believes not shall be
   damned."

                             Citizenship In Heaven

   A SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 12, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "For our conversation is in Heaven; from where also we look for the
   Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ."

   Philippians 3:20.

   THERE can be no comparison between a soaring seraph and a crawling
   worm. Christian men ought so to live that it were idle to speak of a
   comparison between them and the men of the world. It should not be a
   comparison but a contrast. No scale of degrees should be possible. The
   Believer should be a direct and manifest contradiction to the
   unregenerate. The life of a saint should be altogether above and out of
   the same list as the life of a sinner.

   We should compel our critics not to confess that moralists are good,
   and Christians a little better. But while the world is darkness, we
   should manifestly be light. And while the world lies in the Wicked One,
   we should most evidently be of God, and overcome the temptations of
   that Wicked One. Wide as the poles asunder are life and death, light
   and darkness, health and disease, purity and sin, spiritual and carnal,
   Divine and sensual. If we were what we profess to be, we should be as
   distinct a people in the midst of this world, as a white race in a
   community of Ethiopians. There should be no more difficulty in
   detecting the Christian from the worldling than in discovering a sheep
   from a goat, or a lamb from a wolf.

   Alas, the Church is so much adulterated, that we have to abate our
   glorying, and cannot exalt her character as we would. "The precious
   sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen
   pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!" O for the time when
   "our conversation shall be in Heaven," and the ignoble life of the man,
   whose god is his belly, and whose end is destruction, shall be rebuked
   by our unworldly, unselfish character. There should be as much
   difference between the worldling and the Christian as between Hell and
   Heaven, between destruction and eternal life.

   As we hope at last that there shall be a great gulf separating us from
   the doom of the impenitent, there should be here a deep and wide gulf
   between us and the ungodly. The purity of our character should be such
   that men must take knowledge of us that we are of another and superior
   race. God grant us more and more to be most clearly a chosen
   generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that
   we may show forth the praises of Him who has called us out of darkness
   into His marvelous light.

   Brethren, tonight I exhort you to holiness, not by the precepts of the
   Law--not by the thunderings from Sinai--not by the perils or
   punishments which might fall upon you if you are unholy. But by the
   privileges to which you have been admitted. Gracious souls should only
   be urged by arguments from Divine Grace. Whips are for the backs of
   fools, and not for heirs of Heaven. By the honorable citizenship which
   has been bestowed upon you, I shall beseech you to let your
   conversation be in Heaven. And I shall urge that most prevailing
   argument, that the Lord Jesus Christ is coming, and therefore we should
   be as men that watch for our Lord, diligently doing service unto Him,
   that when He comes He may say unto us, "Well done, good and faithful
   servants." I know that the Grace which is in you will freely answer to
   such a plea.

   Our text, I think, might be best translated thus--"Our citizenship is
   in Heaven." The French translation renders it, "As for us, our
   burgessship is in the heavens." Doddridge paraphrases it, "But we
   converse as citizens of Heaven, considering ourselves as denizens of
   the New Jerusalem and only strangers and pilgrims upon earth."

   I. The first idea which is suggested by the verse under consideration
   is this--if our citizenship is in Heaven, then WE ARE ALIENS HERE. We
   are strangers and foreigners, pilgrims and sojourners in the earth, as
   all our fathers were. In the words of Sacred Writ, "Here we have no
   continuing city," but, "we desire a better country, that is an
   heavenly." Let us illustrate our position. A certain young man is sent
   out by his father to trade on behalf of the family--he is sent to
   America, and he is just now living in New York.

   A very fortunate thing it is for him that his citizenship is in
   England. Though he lives in America and trades there, yet he is an
   alien and does not belong to that afflicted nation. For he retains his
   citizenship with us on this side of the Atlantic. Yet there is a line
   of conduct which is due from him to the country which affords him
   shelter, and he must see to it that he does not fail to render it.
   Since we are aliens, we must remember to behave ourselves as aliens
   should, and by no means come short in our duty. We are affected by the
   position of our temporary country.

   A person trading in New York or Boston, though a freeman of the city of
   London, will find himself very much affected by the trade of the United
   States--when the merchants of his city suffer, he will find himself
   suffering with them, the fluctuations of their money market will affect
   his undertakings and the stagnation of commerce will slacken his
   progress. But if prosperity should happily return, he will find that
   when the coffers of their merchants are getting full, his will be the
   better. And the happy development of trade will give buoyancy to his
   own ventures.

   He is not of the nation, and yet every trembling of the scale will
   affect him. He will prosper as that nation prospers, and he will suffer
   as that nation suffers. That is to say, not as a citizen, but as a
   trader. And so we, in this country, find that though we are strangers
   and foreigners on earth, yet we share all the inconveniences of the
   flesh. No exemption is granted to us from the common lot of manhood. We
   are born to trouble, even as others, and have tribulation like the
   rest. When famine comes we hunger. And when war rages we are in danger.

   We are exposed to the same climate, bearing the same burning heat, or
   the same freezing cold. We know the whole train of ills, even as the
   citizens of earth know them. When God in mercy scatters liberally with
   both His hands the bounties of His Providence, we take our share.
   Though we are aliens, yet we live upon the good of the land, and share
   the tender mercies of the God of Providence. Therefore we have to take
   some interest in it. And the good man, though he is a foreigner, will
   not live even a week in this foreign land without seeking to do good
   among the neighbors with whom he dwells.

   The good Samaritan sought not only the good of the Samaritan nation but
   of the Jews. Though there was no sort of kinship among them (for the
   Samaritans were not, as we have often heard erroneously said, first
   cousins or relations to the Jews. Not a drop of Jewish blood ever ran
   in the Samaritans' veins. They were strangers brought from Assyria.
   They had no relation to Abraham whatever), yet the good Samaritan,
   finding himself traveling between Jericho and Jerusalem, did good to
   the Jew, since he was in Judea. The Lord charged His people by His
   servant Jeremiah, "Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you
   to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it: for in the
   peace thereof shall you have peace."

   Since we are here, we must seek the good of this world. "To do good,
   and to communicate, forget not." "Love you your enemies and do good and
   lend, hoping for nothing again. And your reward shall be great, and you
   shall be the children of the Highest: for He is kind unto the
   unthankful and to the evil."

   We must do our utmost while we are here to bring men to Christ, to win
   them from their evil ways, to bring them to eternal life, and to make
   them, with us, citizens of another, and a better land. For, to tell the
   truth, we are here as recruiting sergeants for Heaven. Here to give men
   the enlisting money, to bind upon them the blood red colors of the
   Savior's service, to win them to King Jesus, that, by-and-by, they may
   share His victories after having fought His battles.

   Seeking the good of the country as aliens, we must also remember that
   it behooves aliens to keep themselves very quiet. What business have
   foreigners to plot against the government, or to intermeddle with the
   politics of a country in which they have no citizenship? An Englishman
   in New York had best be without a tongue just now. If he should
   criticize the courage of the generals, the accuracy of their
   dispatches, or the genius of the President, he might meet with rather
   rough usage. He will be injudicious, indeed, if he cannot leave America
   to the Americans.

   So, in this land of ours, where you and I are strangers, we must be
   orderly sojourners, submitting ourselves constantly to those that are
   in authority, leading orderly and peaceable lives, and, according to
   the command of the Holy Spirit through the Apostle, "honoring all men,
   fearing God, honoring the King." "Submitting ourselves to every
   ordinance of man for the Lord's sake." I cannot say that I delight in
   political Christians. I fear that party strife is a serious trial to
   Believers, and I cannot reconcile our heavenly citizenship with the
   schemes of the hustling and the riot of the polling-booth.

   You must follow your own judgment here, but for my part, I am a
   foreigner even in England, and as such I mean to act. We are simply
   passing through this earth and should bless it in our transit but never
   yoke ourselves to its affairs. An

   Englishman may happen to be in Spain--he wishes a thousand things were
   different from what they are, but he does not trouble himself much
   about them--says he," If I were a Spaniard I would see what I could do
   to alter this government but, being an Englishman, let the Spaniards
   see to their own matters. I shall be back in my own country by-and-by,
   and the sooner the better."

   So with Christians here. They are content very much to let the
   potsherds strive with the potsherds of the earth. Their politics
   concern their own country, they do not care much about any other. As
   men they love liberty and are not willing to lose it even in the lower
   sense. But, spiritually, their politics are spiritual, and as citizens
   they look to the interest of that Divine republic to which they belong.
   They wait for the time when, having patiently borne with the laws of
   the land of their banishment, they shall come under the more beneficent
   sway of Him who reigns in Glory, the King of kings and Lord of lords.
   If it is possible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men,
   and serve your day and generation still, but build not your soul's
   dwelling place here, for all this earth must be destroyed at the coming
   of the fiery day.

   Again, let us remember that as aliens we have privileges as well as
   duties. The princes of evil cannot draft us into their regiments. We
   cannot be compelled to do Satan's work. The king of this world may make
   his vassals serve him, but he cannot raise a conscription upon aliens.
   He may order out his troops to this villainy, or to that dastardly
   service, but the child of God claims an immunity from all the commands
   of Satan. Let evil maxims bind the men that own their sway-- we are
   free and own not the prince of the power of the air. I know that men of
   this world say we must keep up appearances. We must be respectable. We
   must do as others do. We must swim with the tide. We must move with the
   crowd.

   But not so the upright Believer--"No," says he, "Do not expect me to
   fall in with your ways and customs. I am in Rome, but I shall not do as
   Rome does. I will let you see that I am an alien, and that I have
   rights as an alien, even here in this foreign land. I am not to be
   bound to fight your battles, nor march at the sound of your drums."
   Brethren, we are soldiers of Christ. We are enlisted in His army. And
   as aliens here, we are not to be constrained into the army of evil. Let
   lords and lands have what masters they will, let us be free, for Christ
   is our Master still. The seventy thousand whom God has reserved, will
   not bow the knee to Baal. Be it known unto you, O world, that we will
   not serve your gods, nor worship the image which you have set up.
   Servants of God we are, and we will not be in bondage unto men.

   As we are free from the conscription of the State, we must remember,
   also, that we are not eligible to its honors. I know you will say that
   is not a privilege. But it is a great benefit if looked at aright. An
   Englishman in New York is not eligible for the very prickly throne of
   the President. I suppose he could not well be made a governor of
   Massachusetts or any other State, and, indeed, he may be well content
   to renounce the difficulties and the honor, too. So also, the Christian
   man here is not eligible to this world's honors. It is a very ill omen
   to hear the world clap its hands and say, "Well done," to the Christian
   man. He may begin to look to his standing and wonder whether he has not
   been doing wrong when the unrighteous give him their approbation.

   "What, did I do wrong," said Socrates, "that yonder villain praised me
   just now?" And so may the Christian say, "What, have I done wrong, that
   So-and-So spoke well of me, for if I had done right, he would not? He
   has not the sense to praise goodness--he could only have applauded that
   which suited his own taste. Christian Brothers and Sisters, you must
   never covet the world's esteem. The love of this world is not in
   keeping with the love of God. "If any man love the world, the love of
   the Father is not in him." Treat its smiles as you treat its threats,
   with quiet contempt. Be willing rather to be sneered at than to be
   approved, counting the Cross of Christ greater riches than all the
   treasures of Egypt.

   O harlot world, it were a sad dishonor to be your favorite! Tire your
   head and paint your face, you Jezebel, but you are no friend of ours,
   nor will we desire your hollow love. The men of this world were mad to
   raise us to their seats of honor, for we are aliens and citizens of
   another country. When the Pope sent a noted Protestant statesman a
   present of some silver goblets, he returned them with this answer--"The
   citizens of Zurich compel their judges to swear twice in the year that
   they will receive no presents from foreign princes, therefore take them
   back." More than twice in the year should the Christian resolve that he
   will not accept the smiles of this world and will do no homage to its
   glory.

   "We fear the Greeks even when they bear gifts." Like the Trojans of
   old, we may be beguiled with presents even if unconquered in arms.
   Forswear then, the grandeur and honor of this fleeting age. Say in
   life, what a proud cardinal said in death, "Vain pomp and glory of the
   world, I hate you." Pass through Vanity Fair without trading in its
   vanities, cry- ing, in answer to their "What will you buy?"--"We buy
   the Truth of God." Take up the pilgrim's song and sing it always--

   "The things eternal I pursue,
   And happiness beyond the view
   Of those who basely pant
   For things by nature felt and seen.
   Their honors, wealth and pleasures mean,
   I neither have nor want.
   Nothing on earth I call my own--
   A stranger to the world unknown,
   I all their goods despise.
   I trample on their whole delight,
   And seek a country out of sight--
   A country in the skies."

   Furthermore, as aliens, it is not for us to hoard up this world's
   treasures. Gentlemen, you who know the exchange of New York, would you
   hoard up any extensive amount of Mr. Chase's green-backed notes? I
   think not. Those stamps which officiate in the States in lieu of copper
   coinage I should hardly desire to accumulate. Perhaps the fire might
   consume them, or if not, the gradual process of wear and tear which
   they are sure to undergo might leave me penniless before long. "No,
   Sir," says the British trader, "I am an alien. I cannot very well
   accept payment in these bits of paper. They are very well for you,
   perhaps.

   "They will pass current in your state but my riches must be riches in
   England, for I am going there to live directly. I must have solid gold,
   old English sovereigns, nothing else but these can make me rich."
   Brethren, so it is with us. If we are aliens, the treasures of this
   world are like those bits of paper, of little value in our esteem. And
   we should lay up our treasure in Heaven, "where neither moth nor rust
   does corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal." The
   money of this world is not current in Paradise. And when we reach its
   blissful shore, if regret can be known, we shall wish that we had laid
   up more treasure in the land of our fatherhood, in the dear fatherland
   beyond the skies.

   Transport your jewels to a safer country than this world. Be rich
   toward God rather than before men. A certain minister collecting for a
   Chapel, called upon a rich merchant, who generously gave him fifty
   pounds. As the good man was going out with sparkling eye at the
   liberality of the merchant, the tradesman opened a , and he said, "Stop
   a minute, I find by this letter, I have lost this morning a ship worth
   six thousand pounds." The poor minister trembled in his shoes, for he
   thought the next word would be, "Let me have the fifty pound check
   back."

   Instead of it, it was "Let me have the check back a moment," and then
   taking out his pen he wrote him a check for five hundred pounds. "As my
   money is going so fast, it is well," said he, "to make sure of some of
   it, so I will put some of it in God's bank." The man, you doubt not,
   went his way astonished at such a way of dealing as this, but indeed
   that is just what a man should do, who feels he is an alien here and
   his treasure is beyond the sky--

   "There is my house and portion fair;
   My treasure and my heart are there,
   And my abiding home--
   For me my elder Brethren stay,
   And angels beckon me away,
   And Jesus bids me come."

   II. It is our comfort now to remind you that although aliens on earth,
   WE ARE CITIZENS IN HEAVEN.

   What is meant by our being citizens in Heaven? Why, first that we are
   under Heaven's government. Christ, the king of Heaven, reigns in our
   hearts. The laws of Glory are the laws of our consciences. Our daily
   prayer is, "Your will be done on earth as it is in Heaven." The
   proclamations issued from the Throne of Glory are freely received by
   us. The decrees of the Great King we cheerfully obey. We are not
   without Law to Christ. The Spirit of God rules in our mortal bodies.
   Divine Grace reigns through righteousness, and we wear the easy yoke of
   Jesus. O that He would sit as king in our hearts, like Solomon upon his
   throne of gold. Yours are we, Jesus, and all that we have, You rule
   without a rival.

   As citizens of the New Jerusalem, we share Heaven's honors. The glory
   which belongs to beatified saints belongs to us, for we are already
   sons of God, already princes of the blood imperial. Already we wear the
   spotless robe of Jesus' righteousness. Already we have angels for our
   servitors, saints for our companions, Christ for our Brother, God for
   our Father, and a crown of immortality for our reward. We share the
   honors of citizenship, for we have come to the general assembly and
   Church of the First-Born, whose names are written in Heaven. "Beloved,
   now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall
   be: but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like He is. For
   we shall see Him as He is."

   As citizens, we have common rights in all the property of Heaven. Those
   wide extensive plains we sung ofjust now are ours. Ours the yonder
   harps of gold and crowns of glory. Ours the gates of pearl and walls of
   chrysolite. Ours the azure light of the city that needs no candle nor
   light of the sun. Ours the river of the Water of Life, and the twelve
   manner of fruits which grow on the trees planted at the side thereof.
   There is nothing in Heaven that belongs not to us, for our citizenship
   is there. "Things present, or things to come, all are ours. And we are
   Christ's. And Christ is God's."

   And as we are thus under Heaven's government, and share its honors and
   partake of its possessions, so we today enjoy its delights. Do they
   rejoice over sinners that are born to God--prodigals that have
   returned? So do we. Do they chant the glories of triumphant Grace? We
   do the same. Do they cast their crowns at Jesus' feet? Such honors as
   we have, we cast there, too. Do they rejoice in Him? So, also, do we.
   Do they triumph, waiting for His second advent? By faith we triumph in
   the same. Are they tonight singing, "Worthy the Lamb"? We also have
   sung the same tune, not to such glorious notes as theirs, but with as
   sincere hearts. With minstrelsy not quite so splendid, but we hope as
   sincere, for the Spirit gave us the music which we have, and the Spirit
   gave them the thunders of their acclamations before the Throne. "Our
   citizenship is in Heaven."

   Brethren, we rejoice to know, also, that as the result of our being
   citizens, or rather I ought to have said as the cause of it, our names
   are written in the roll of Heaven's freemen. When, at last, the list
   shall be read, our names, by His Grace, shall be read, too. For where
   Paul and Peter, where David and Jonathan, where Abraham and Jacob shall
   be found, we shall be found, too. Numbered with them we were in the
   Divine purpose, reckoned with them we were in the purchase on the
   Cross, and with them shall we sit down forever at the tables of the
   blessed. The small and the great are fellow citizens and of the same
   household.

   The babes and the perfect men are recorded in the same great registry,
   and neither death nor Hell can erase a single name. Our citizenship,
   then, is in Heaven. We have not time to expand that thought. John
   Calvin says of this text, "It is a most abundant source of many
   exhortations, which it were easy for anyone to elicit from it." We are
   not all Calvin. But even to our smaller capacities, the subject appears
   to be one not readily exhausted, but rich with unfathomable joy.

   III. We must now come to our third point, which is OUR CONVERSATION IS
   IN HEAVEN. Our walk and acts are such as are consistent with our
   dignity as citizens of Heaven. Among the old Romans, when a dastardly
   action was proposed it was thought a sufficient refusal to answer,
   "Romanus sum--I am a Roman."

   Surely it should be a strong incentive to every good thing if we can
   claim to be freemen of the Eternal City. Let our lives be conformed to
   the glory of our citizenship. In Heaven they are holy, so must we
   be--so are we if our citizenship is not a mere presence. They are
   happy, so must we be rejoicing in the Lord always. In Heaven they are
   obedient--so must we be, following the faintest monitions of the Divine
   will. In Heaven they are active, so should we be, both day and night
   praising and serving God. In Heaven they are peaceful, so should we
   find a rest in Christ, and be at peace even now.

   In Heaven they rejoice to behold the face of Christ, so should we be
   always meditating upon Him, studying His beauties, and desiring to look
   into the Truths of God which He has taught. In Heaven they are full of
   love, so should we love one another as Brethren. In Heaven they have
   sweet communion, one with another. So should we, who though many, are
   one body, be every one members one of the other. Before the Throne they
   are free from envy and strife, ill-will, jealousy, emulation,
   falsehood, anger. So should we be--we should, in fact, seek while we
   are here, to keep up the manners and customs of the good old
   fatherland, so that, as in Paris, the Parisian soon says, "There goes
   John Bull," so they should be able to say in this land, "there goes a
   heavenly citizen, one who is with us and among us but is not of us."

   Our very speech should be such that our citizenship should be detected.
   We should not be able to live long in a house without men finding out
   what we are. A friend of mine once went across to America, and landing,
   I think, at Boston, he knew nobody. But hearing a man say, when
   somebody had dropped a cask on the quay, "Look out there, or else you
   will make a Coggeshall job of it," he said, "You are an Essex man I
   know, for that is a proverb never used anywhere but in Essex--give me
   your hand." And they were friends at once.

   So there should be a ring of true metal about our speech and
   conversation, so that when a Brother meets us, he can say, "You are a
   Christian, I know, for none but Christians speak like that, or act like
   that." "You also were with Jesus of Nazareth, for your speech betrays
   you." Our holiness should act as a sort of beacon by which we know how
   to give the grip to the stranger, who is not a real stranger, but a
   fellow citizen with us, and of the household of faith.

   Oh, dear Friends, wherever we wander, we should never forget our
   beloved land. In Australia, on the other side the world, or in the Cape
   of Good Hope, or wherever else we may be exiled, surely every
   Englishman's eye must turn to this fair island--and with all her
   faults, we must love her still. And surely let us be where we may, our
   eyes must turn to Heaven, the happy land unstained by shadow of fault.
   We love her still and love her more and more, praying for the time when
   our banishment shall expire, and we shall enter into our Fatherland to
   dwell there forever and ever.

   Shenstone says, "The proper means of increasing the love we bear our
   native country is to reside some time in a foreign land." Sure am I
   that we who cry, "Woe is me, for I dwell in Mesech and sojourn in the
   tents of Cedar!" are sure to add, "O that I had wings like a dove, for
   then would I fly away and be at rest."

   IV. The text says, "Our conversation is in Heaven," and I think we may
   also read it, as though it said, "OUR COMMERCE IS IN HEAVEN." We are
   trading on earth, but still the bulk of our trade is with Heaven. We
   trade for trinkets in this land but our gold and silver are in Heaven.

   We commune with Heaven and how? Our trade is with Heaven by meditation,
   we often think of God, our Father, and Christ, our Brother. And, by the
   Spirit, the Comforter, we are brought in contemplative delight to the
   general assembly and Church of the First-Born, whose names are written
   in Heaven. Brethren, do not our thoughts sometimes burn within us, when
   we trade with that blessed land? When I have sent the ships of
   understanding and consideration to that land of Ophir, which is full of
   gold, and they have come back again laden with all manner of precious
   things, my thoughts have been enriched--my soul has longed to journey
   to that good land.

   Black and stormy are you, O sea of death, but I would cross you to
   reach that land of Havilah, which has dust of gold. I know that he who
   is a Christian will never have his mind long off that better land. And
   do you know we sometimes trade with Heaven in our hymns? They tell us
   of the Swiss soldiery in foreign countries, that there is a song which
   the band is forbidden to play, because it reminds them of the cowbells
   of their native hills. If the men hear it, they are sure to desert, for
   that dear old song revives before their eyes the wooden chalets and the
   cows and the pastures of the glorious Alps and they long to be away.

   There are some of our hymns that make us homesick, until we are hardly
   content to stop, and therefore, well did our poet end his song--

   "Filled with delight, my raptured soul, Can here no longer stay. Though
   Jordan's waves around us roll, Fearless we launch away." I feel the
   spirit of Wesley, when he said--

   "O that we now might see our Guide! O that the word were given! Come,
   Lord of Hosts, the waves divide, And land us all in Heaven.

   In times of high, hallowed, heavenly harmony of praise, the songs of
   angels seem to come astray and find their way down to us. And then our
   songs return with them, hand in hand, and go back to God's Throne,
   through Jesus Christ.

   We trade with Heaven, I hope, too, not only thus by meditation and by
   thought, and by song, but by hopes and by loves. Our love is toward
   that land. How heartily the Germans sing of the dear old fatherland.
   But they cannot, with all their Germanic patriotism, they cannot beat
   the genial glow of the Briton's heart, when he thinks of his
   fatherland, too. The Scotchman, too, wherever he may be, remembers the
   land of "brown heath and shaggy wood." And the Irishman, too, let him
   be where he will, still thinks the "Emerald Isle" the first gem of the
   sea.

   It is right that the patriot should love his country. Does not our love
   fervently flame towards Heaven? We think we cannot speak well enough of
   it, and, indeed, here we are correct, for no exaggeration is possible.
   When we talk of that land of Eschol, our mouths are watering to taste
   its clusters. Already, like David, we thirst to drink of the well that
   is within the gate. And we hunger after the good corn of the land. Our
   ears are wanting to have done with the discords of earth, that they may
   open to the harmonies of Heaven. And our tongues are longing to sing
   the melodious sonnets, sung by flaming ones above. Yes, we do love
   Heaven, and thus it is that we prove that our commerce is with that
   better land.

   Brethren, just as people in a foreign land that love their country
   always are glad to have plenty of letters from the country, I hope we
   have much communication with the old fatherland. We send our prayers
   there as letters to our Father, and we get His letters back in this
   blessed volume of His Word. You go into an Australian settler's hut,
   and you find a newspaper. Where from, Sir? A gazette from the south of
   France, a journal from America? Oh no, it is a newspaper from England,
   addressed to him in his old mother's handwriting, bearing the postage
   stamp with the good Queen's face in the comer.

   And he likes it, though it is only a newspaper from some little
   pottering country town, with no news in it. Yet he likes it better,
   perhaps, than the "Times" itself, because it talks to him about the
   village where he lived, and consequently touches a special string in
   the harp of his soul. So must it be with Heaven. This book, the Bible,
   is the newspaper of Heaven, and therefore we must love it. The sermons
   which are preached are good news from a far country. The hymns we sing
   are notes by which we tell our Father of our welfare here, and by which
   He whispers into our soul His continued love to us. All these are, and
   must be pleasant to us, for our commerce is with Heaven.

   I hope, too, we are sending a good deal home. I like to see our young
   fellows, when they go out to live in the bush, remember their mother at
   home. They say, "She had a hard struggle to bring us up when our father
   died, and she scraped her little together to help us to emigrate." John
   and Tom mutually agree, "the first gold we get at the diggings we will
   send home to mother." And it goes home. Well, I hope you are sending a
   great many things home.

   Dear Friends, I hope as we are aliens here, we are not laying up our
   treasure here, where we may lose it, but packing it off as quickly as
   we can to our own country. There are many ways of doing it. God has
   many banks. And they are all safe ones. We have but to serve His
   Church, or serve the souls which Christ has bought with His blood, or
   help His poor, clothe His naked, and feed His hungry--and we send our
   treasures beyond sea in a safe ship. And so we keep up our commerce
   with the skies.

   V. Time has gone. Those clocks will strike when yours ought not. There
   is a great reason why we should live like aliens and foreigners here,
   and that is because CHRIST IS COMING SOON. The early Church never
   forgot this. Did they not pant and thirst after the return of their
   ascended Lord? Like the twelve tribes, day and night they instantly
   watched for Messiah.

   But the Church has grown weary of this hope. There have been so many
   false prophets who tell us that Christ is coming, that the Church
   thinks He never will come. And she begins to deny, or to keep in the
   background the blessed doctrine of the second advent of her Lord from
   Heaven. I do not think the fact that there have been many false
   prophets should make us doubt our Lord's true word. Perhaps the very
   frequency of these mistakes may show that there is truth at the bottom.

   You have a friend who is ill, and the doctor says he cannot last long.
   He must die. You have called a great many times expecting to hear of
   his departure but he is still alive. Now the frequent errors of the
   physicians do not prove that your friend will not die one of these
   days, and that speedily, too. And so, though the false prophets have
   said, "Lo, here," and "Lo, there," and yet Christ has not come--that
   does not prove that His glorious appearing will never arrive.

   You know I am no prophet. I do not know anything about 1866. I find
   quite enough to do to attend to 1862. I do not understand the visions
   of Daniel or Ezekiel. I find I have enough to do to teach the simple
   word such as I find in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and the Epistles
   of Paul. I do not find many souls have been converted to God by
   exquisite dissertations about the battle of Armageddon, and all those
   other fine things. I have no doubt prophesying is very profitable, but
   I rather question whether they are so profitable to the hearers, as
   they may be to the preachers and publishers.

   I conceive that among religious people of a certain sort, the abortive
   explanations of prophecy issued by certain doctors gratify a craving
   which irreligious people find its food in novels and romances. People
   have a panting to know the future. And certain divines pander to this
   depraved taste, by prophesying for them and letting them know what is
   coming by-and-by. I do not know the future and I shall not pretend to
   know. But I do preach this, because I know it, that Christ will come,
   for He says so in a hundred passages.

   The Epistles of Paul are full of the advent, and Peter's, too, and
   John's letters are crowded with it. The best of saints have always
   lived on the hope of the advent. There was Enoch--he prophesied of the
   coming of the Son of Man. So there was another Enoch who was always
   talking of the coming, and saying, "Come quickly." I will not divide
   the house tonight by discussing whether the advent will be
   premillennial or postmillennial, or anything of that. It is enough for
   me that He will come, and, "in such an hour as you think not, the Son
   of Man will come."

   Tonight He may appear, while here we stand. Just when we think that he
   will not come, the thief shall break open the house. We ought,
   therefore, to be always watching. Since the gold and silver that you
   have will be worthless at His advent. Since your lands and estates will
   melt to smoke when He appears. Since, then the righteous shall be rich
   and the godly shall be great, lay not up your treasure here, for it may
   at any time vanish, at any time disappear, for Christ at any moment may
   come.

   I think the Church would do well to be always living as if Christ might
   come today. I feel persuaded she is doing ill if she works as if He
   would not come till 1866, because He may come before, and He may come
   this moment. Let her always be living as if He would come now, still
   acting in her Master's sight, and watching unto prayer. Never mind
   about the last vials--fill your own vial with sweet odors and offer it
   before the Lord. Think what you like about Armageddon. But forgot not
   to fight the good fight of faith. Guess not at the precise era for the
   destruction of Antichrist, go and destroy it yourself, fighting against
   it every day. But be looking forward and hastening unto the coming of
   the Son of Man. And let this be at once your comfort and excitement to
   diligence--that the Savior will soon come from Heaven.

   Now, I think you foreigners here present--and I hope there are a great
   many true aliens here--ought to feel like a poor stranded mariner on a
   desolate island. You have saved a few things from the wreck and built
   yourself an old log hut. You have a few comforts round about you, but
   for all that you long for home. Every morning you look out to sea and
   wonder when you shall see a sail. Many times while examining the wide
   ocean to look for a ship, you have clapped your hands, and then wept to
   find you were mistaken. Every night you light a fire that there may be
   a blaze, so that if a ship should go by, they may send relief to you.

   Ah, that is just the way we ought to live. We have heard of one saint
   who used to open his window every morning when he woke, to see if
   Christ had come. It might be fanaticism, but better to be enthusiastic
   than to mind earthly things. I would have us look out each night, and
   light the fire of prayer, that it may be burning in case the ships of
   Heaven should go by--that blessings may come to us poor aliens and
   foreigners who need them so much. Let us wait patiently till the Lord's
   convoy shall take us on board, that we may be carried into the glories
   and splendor of the reign of Christ.

   Let us always hold the log hut with a loose hand and long for the time
   when we shall get to that better land where our possessions are, where
   our Father lives, where our treasures lie, where all our Brethren
   dwell. Well said our poet --

   "Blest scenes,
   Through rude and stormy seas I onward press to You."

   My Beloved Friends, I can assure you it is always one of the sweetest
   thoughts I ever know, that I shall meet with you in Heaven. There are
   so many of you members of this Church, that I can hardly get to shake
   hands with you once in a year. But I shall have plenty of time, then,
   in Heaven. You will know your pastor in Heaven better than you do now.
   He loves you now, and you love him. We shall then have more time to
   recount our experience of Divine Grace, and praise God together, and
   sing together, and rejoice together concerning Him by whom we were
   helped to plant and sow, and through whom all the increase came--

   "I hope when days and years are past, We all shall meet in Heaven, We
   all shall meet in Heaven at last, We all shall meet in Heaven."

   But we shall not all meet in glory. Not all, unless you repent. Some of
   you will certainly perish, unless you believe in Christ. But why must
   we be divided? Oh, why not all in Heaven? "Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and you shall be saved." "He that believes and is baptized shall
   be saved but he that believes not shall be damned." Trust Christ,
   Sinner, and Heaven is yours and mine, and we are safe, by His Grace,
   forever. Amen.

   A Sermon

   (No. 477)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, October 26th, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."--Hebrews
   13:5.

   WHAT POWER RESIDES in "Thus saith the Lord!" The man who can grasp by
   faith, "He hath said," has an all-conquering weapon in his hand. What
   doubt will not be slain by this to two-edged sword? What fear is that
   which shall not fall smitten with a deadly wound before this arrow from
   the bow of God's covenant? Will not the distresses of life and the
   pangs of death, will not the corruptions within and the temptations
   without, will not the trials from above and the temptations from
   beneath all seem but light afflictions when we can hide ourselves
   behind the bulwark of "He hath said?" Whether for delight in our
   quietude, or for strength in our conflict, "He hath said" must be our
   daily resort.

   Hence, let us learn, my brethren, the extreme value of searching the
   Scriptures. There may be a promise in the Word which would exactly fit
   your case, but you may not know of it, and therefore miss its comfort.
   You are like prisoners in a dungeon, and there may be one key in the
   bunch which would unlock the door, and you might be free; but if you
   will not look for it you may remain a prisoner still, though liberty is
   near at hand. There may be a potent medicine in the great pharmacopia
   of Scripture, and you may still remain sick, though there is the
   precise remedy that would meet your disease, unless you will examine
   and search the Scriptures to discover what "He hath said." Should we
   not, beside reading Scripture, store our memories richly with the
   promises of God? We can recollect the sayings of great men; we treasure
   up the verses of renowned poets; ought we not to be profound in our
   knowledge of the words of God? The Scriptures should be the classics of
   a Christian, and as our orators quote Homer, or Virgil, or Horace, when
   they would clinch a point, so we should be able to quote the promises
   of God when we would solve a difficulty or overthrow a doubt. "He hath
   said," is the foundation of all riches and the fountain of all comfort,
   let it dwell in you richly as "a well of water, springing up unto
   everlasting life." And, oh, my brethren, how diligently should we test
   the Scriptures! Besides searching them by reading, and treasuring them
   by memory, we should test them by experience, and so often as a promise
   is proven to be true we should make a mark against it, and note that we
   also can say, as did one of old, "This is my comfort in my affliction:
   for thy word hath quickened me." "Wait on the Lord," said Isaiah, and
   then he added "Wait, I say, on the Lord," as if his own experience led
   him to echo the voice of God to his hearers. Test the promise, take
   God's banknote to the counter, and mark if it be cashed. Grasp the
   lever, which he ordains to lift your trials, and try if it possesses
   real power. Cast this divine tree into the bitter waters of your Marah,
   and learn how it will sweeten them. Take this salt, and throw it into
   the turbid waters, and witness if they be not made sweet, as were the
   waters of old by the prophet Elisha. Taste and see that the Lord is
   good, for there is no want to them that fear him.

   The Apostles, you will notice, like their Master, were always very
   ready at quotations. Though they were inspired men, and could have used
   fresh words, yet they preferred, as an example to us, to quote "He hath
   said;" let us do the same, for, though the words of ministers may be
   sweet, the words of God are sweeter; and though original thoughts may
   have the novelty of freshness, yet the ancient words of God have the
   ring, and the weight, and the value of old and precious coins, and they
   shall not be found wanting in the day when we shall use them.

   It seems from our text that "He hath said" is not only useful to chase
   away doubts, fears, difficulties, and devils, but that it also yieldeth
   nourishment to all our graces. You perceive that when the apostle would
   make us contented, he says, "Be content with such things as ye have,
   for he hath said;" and when he would make us bold and courageous, he
   puts it, "He hath said, therefore, we may boldly say, God is my helper,
   I will not fear what man can do unto me." When the apostle would
   nourish faith, he does it by quoting from Scripture the examples of
   Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, of Moses, of Gideon, of Barak, and of
   Jephthah. When he would nourish our patience, he says, "Ye remember the
   patience of Job;" or if it be our prayerfulness, he says, "Elias was a
   man of like passions with us, and he prayed and prevailed." "He hath
   said" is food for every grace as well as death for every sin. Here you
   have nourishment for that which is good, and poison for that which is
   evil. Search ye, then, the Scriptures, for so shall ye grow healthy,
   strong, and vigorous in the divine life.

   We turn at once, with great pleasure, to the wonderful words of our
   text, "He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." I have
   no doubt you are aware that our translation does not convey the whole
   force of the original, and that it would hardly be possible in English
   to give the full weight of the Greek. We might render it, "He hath
   said, I will never, never leave thee; I will never, never, never
   forsake thee;" for, though that would be not a literal, but rather a
   free rendering, yet, as there are five negatives in the Greek, we do
   not know how to give their force in any other way. Two negatives
   nullify each other in our language; but here, in the Greek, they
   intensify the meaning following one after another, as I suppose David's
   five stones out of the brook would have done if the first had not been
   enough to make the giant reel. The verse we sung just now is a very
   good rendering of the original--

   "'The soul that on Jesus hath lean'd for repose,

   I will not, I will not desert to his foes;

   That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,

   I'll never, no never, no never forsake."

   Here you have the five negatives very well placed, and the force of the
   Greek, as nearly as possible, given.

   In trying to expound this five-fold assurance, this quintessence of
   consolation, we shall have to draw your attention, first of all, to an
   awful condition, or what is negatived; secondly, to a gracious promise,
   or what is positively guaranteed; next, we shall observe notable
   occasions or times when this promise was uttered; a few words upon
   certain sweet confirmations which prove the text to be true; and then,
   in the fifth place, necessary conclusions which flow from the words of
   the promise.

   I. First of all, then, AN AWFUL CONDITION--lost and FORSAKEN of God! I
   am quite certain I shall fail in attempting to describe this state of
   mind. I have thought of it, dreamed of it, and felt it in such feeble
   measure as a child of God can feel it, but how to describe it I know
   not.

   1. Forsaking implies an utter loneliness. Put a traveler in a vast
   howling wilderness, where for many a league there is no trace of
   man--no foot-step of traveler. The solitary wretch cries for help--the
   hollow echo of the rocks is his only reply. No bird in the air; not
   even a prowling jackal in the waste; not an insect in the sunbeam to
   keep him company; not even a solitary blade of grass to remind him of
   God! Yet, even there he is not alone: for yon bare rocks prove a God,
   and the hot sand beneath his feet, and the blazing sun above his head,
   all witness to a present Deity. But what would be the loneliness of a
   man forsaken of God! No migration could be so awful as this, for he
   says, "If I take the wings of the morning and fly to the uttermost
   parts of the sea thou art there." Such a state were worse than hell,
   for David says, "If I make my bed in hell thou art there." Loneliness
   is a feeling which none of us delight in. Solitude may have some
   charms, but they who are forced to be her captives have not discovered
   them. A transient solitude may give pleasure; to be alone, utterly
   alone, is terrible; to be alone, without God, is such an emphasis of
   loneliness, that I defy the lip even of a damned spirit to express the
   horror and anguish that must be concentrated in it. There is far more
   than you and I dream of in the language of our Lord Jesus, when he
   says, "I have trodden the wine-press alone." Alone! You remember he
   once said, "Ye shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because
   the Father is with me." There is no agony in that sentence, but what
   must be his grief when he says--"I have trodden the wine-press alone!"
   "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" is the cry of human nature in its
   uttermost dismay. Thank God, you and I by this promise are taught that
   we never shall know the desperate loneliness of being forsaken of God;
   yet, this is what it would be if he should forsake us!

   2. Mingling with this mournful solitude is a sense of utter
   helplessness. Power belongeth unto God; withdraw the Lord, and the
   strong men must utterly fail. The archangel without God passes away and
   is not; the everlasting hills do bow, and the solid pillars of the
   earth are dissolved. Without God our dust returneth to the earth;
   without God our spirit mourneth like David, "I am forgotten as a dead
   man out of mind; I am like a broken vessel." Christ knew what this was
   when he said, "I am a worm, and no man." He was so utterly broken, so
   emptied of all power, that as he hung with dislocated limbs upon the
   cross, he cried, "My strength is dried up like a potsherd; thou hast
   brought me into the dust of death." No broken reed or smoking flax can
   be so feeble as a soul forsaken of God. Our state would be as
   deplorably destitute as that of Ezekiel's infant, deserted and cast
   into the open field with none to swaddle and none to care for it, left
   utterly to perish and to die,--such should we be if we could be
   forsaken of God! Glorious are those negatives which shut us in from all
   fear of this calamity.

   3. To be forsaken of God implies utter friendlessness. A thousand times
   let Jehovah be blessed that very few of us have ever known what it is
   to be friendless! There have been times in the experience of some of us
   when we felt that we stood without a friend in the particular spot
   which we then occupied, for we had a grief which we could not entrust
   to any other heart. Every man who is eminently useful in the Church
   will know seasons when as the champion of Israel he must go forth
   alone. This, however, is compensated by stronger faith, and the moral
   grandeur of solitary heroism. But what must it be to be some poor
   wretch whose parents have long since been buried; who has lost his most
   distant relatives; who, passing along the street remembers the name of
   one who was once his father's friend, knocks at the door, and is
   repulsed; recollects another--and this is his last hope--one he played
   with in his infancy--stands at that door asking for charity and is
   bidden to go his way, and paces the cold November streets while the
   rain is pouring down, feeling to his utter dismay that no friend
   breathes for him? Should he return to his own parish it would be like
   going to his own dungeon, and if he enters the workhouse no eye there
   will flash sympathy upon him! He is utterly friendless and alone! I
   believe that many a suicide has been produced by the want of a friend.
   As long as a man feels he has some one loving him, he has something
   worth living for; but when the last friend is gone and we feel that we
   are floating on a raft far out at sea, with not a sail in sight, and we
   cry, "Welcome death!" Our Lord and Master was brought to this state,
   and knew what it was to be forsaken, for he had no friends left. "He
   that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me." "All the
   disciples forsook him and fled." Brethren, many saints have lost all
   their friends, but have bravely borne the trial, for turning their eye
   to heaven, they have felt that though without friends they were still
   befriended. They have heard the voice of Jesus say, "I will not leave
   you orphans; I will come unto you;" and, made strong by Divine
   friendship, they have felt that they were not utterly bereaved. But to
   be forsaken of God! Oh, may you and I never know it! To be without a
   friend in heaven; to look to that throne of glory and to see the
   blackness of darkness there; to turn to mercy and receive a frown; to
   fly to love and receive a rebuke; to turn to God and find that his ear
   is heavy that he will not hear, and his hand restrained that he will
   not help--oh! this is terror, terror heaped on terror, to be thus
   forsaken!

   4. Loneliness, helplessness, friendlessness--add these together, and
   then put the next--hopelessness. A man forsaken of men may still
   entertain some hope. But let him be forsaken of God, and then hope hath
   failed; the last window is shut; not a ray of light now streams into
   the thick Egyptian darkness of his mind. Life is death; death is
   damnation--damnation in its lowest deeps. Let him look to men, and they
   are broken reeds; let him turn to angels, and they are avengers; let
   him look to death, and even the tomb affords no refuge. Look where he
   will, blank, black despair seizes hold upon him. Our blessed Lord knew
   this when lover and friend had been put far from him, and his
   acquaintance into darkness. It was only his transcendent faith which
   enabled him after all to say "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell:
   neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." The black
   shadow of this utter hopelessness went over him when he said, "My soul
   is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death," and he "sweat as it were
   great drops of blood, falling down to the ground."

   5. To make up this five-fold forsaking, against which we have the five
   negatives, let us add to all this loneliness, helplessness,
   friendlessness, and hopelessness, a sense of unutterable agony. We
   speak of agony, but to feel it is a very different thing. Misery and
   despair--the wrestling of these with the spirit till the spirit is
   trodden down, and crushed, and broken, and chooses strangling rather
   than life; a horrible sense of every evil having made one's heart its
   den; a consciousness that we are the target for all God's arrows; that
   all God's waves and billows have gone over us; that he hath forgotten
   to be gracious; that he will be merciful to us no more; that he hath in
   anger shut up the bowels of his compassion--this is a part of being
   forsaken of God which only lost spirits in hell can know! Our unbelief
   sometimes lets us get a glimpse of what this would be, but it is only a
   glimpse, only a glimpse; let us thank God that we are delivered from
   all fear of this tremendous evil. By five wounds doth our Redeemer slay
   our unbelief.

   Brethren, if God should leave us, mark the result: I picture to myself
   the very best state of one forsaken of God--it is uncertainty and
   chance. I would rather be an atom, which hath God with it,
   predestinating its track and forcing it onward according to his own
   will, than I would be an archangel left to my own choice, to do as I
   would and to act at I please, without the control of God; for an
   archangel, left without God, would soon miss his way, and fall to hell;
   or he would melt away, and drop and die; but the tiny atom, having God
   with it, would fulfill its predestinated course; it would be ever in a
   sure track, and throughout eternity would have as much potence in it as
   at its first creation. I cannot think why some people are so fond of
   free-will. I believe free-will is the delight of sinners, but that
   God's will is the glory of saints. There is nothing I desire more to
   get rid of than my own will, and to be absorbed into the will and
   purpose of my Lord. To do according to the will of Him who is most
   good, most true, most wise, most mighty, seems to me to be heaven. Let
   others choose the dignity of independence, I crave the glory of being
   wholly dead in Christ, and only alive in him. Oh! dear friends, if the
   Lord should forsake us, to say the best of it, our course would be
   uncertain, and, ere long it would end in nothingness. We know, further,
   that if God should forsake the best saint alive, that man would
   immediately fall into sin. He now stands securely on yonder lofty
   pinnacle, but his brain would reel and he would fall, if secret hands
   did not uphold him. He now picks his steps carefully; take away grace
   from him and he would roll in the mire, and wallow in it like other
   men. Let the godly be forsaken of his God, and he would go from bad to
   worse, till his conscience, now so tender, would be seared as with a
   hot iron. Next he would ripen into an atheist or a blasphemer, and he
   would come to his dying bed foaming at the mouth with rage; would come
   before the bar of his Maker with a curse upon his lip; and in eternity,
   left and forsaken of God, he would sink to hell with the condemned, ay,
   and among the damned he would have the worst place, lower than the
   lowest, finding in the lowest depths a lower depth, finding in the
   wrath of God something more dreadful than the ordinary wrath which
   falleth upon common sinners!

   When we thus describe being forsaken of God, is it not satisfactory to
   the highest degree to remember that we have God's word for it five
   times over, "I will never, never leave thee; I will never, never, never
   forsake thee?" I know those who caricature Calvinism say we teach that
   let a man live as he likes, yet if God be with him, he will be safe at
   the last. We teach no such thing, and our adversaries know better. They
   know that our doctrines are invulnerable if they will state them
   correctly, and that the only way in which they can attack us is to
   slander us and to misrepresent what we teach. Nay, verily, we say not
   so, but we say that where God begins the good work, the man will never
   live as he likes, or if he does, he will like to live as God would have
   him live; that where God begins a good work he carries it on; that man
   is never forsaken of God, nor does he forsake God, but is kept even to
   the end.

   II. We have before us now, in the second place, A GRACIOUS PROMISE, or
   what is positively guaranteed.

   What is guaranteed in this promise? Beloved, herein doth God give to
   his people everything. "I will never leave thee." Then no attribute of
   God can cease to be engaged for us. Is he mighty? He will show himself
   strong on the behalf of them that trust him. Is HE love? Then with
   everlasting lovingkindness will he have mercy upon us. Whatever
   attributes may compose the character of Deity every one of them to its
   fullest extent shall be engaged on our side. Moreover, whatsoever God
   hath, whether it be in the lowest hades or in the highest heaven,
   whatever can be contained in infinity or can be held within the
   circumference of eternity, whatever, in fine, can be in him who filleth
   all things, and yet is greater than all things, shall be with his
   people for ever, since "He hath said, I will never leave you, nor
   forsake you." How one might enlarge here, but I forbear; ye yourselves
   know that to sum up "all things" is a task beyond all human might.

   III. More fully, however, to expound this promise, I would remind you
   of the five OCCASIONS in which it occurs in Scripture. The number five
   rune all through our subject. The sense and spirit of the text are to
   be found in innumerable places, and possibly there may be some other
   passages which approximate so very nearly to our text, that you might
   say they also are repetitions, but I think there are five which may
   clearly take the priority.

   1. One of the first instances is to be found in Genesis 28:15. "Behold,
   I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest,
   and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee,
   until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of." Here we have
   this promise in the case of a man of trials. More than either Abraham
   or Isaac, Jacob was the son of tribulation. He was now flying away from
   his father's house, leaving the over-fondness of a mother's attachment,
   abhorred by his elder brother, who sought his blood. He lies down to
   sleep, with a stone for his pillow, with the hedges for his curtains,
   with the earth for his bed, and the heavens for his canopy; and as he
   sleeps thus friendless, solitary, and alone, God saith to him "I will
   never, never leave thee." Mark his after career. He is guided to
   Padan-aram; God, his guide, leaves him not. At Padan-aram Laban cheats
   him, wickedly and wrongfully cheats him in many ways; but God doth not
   leave him, and he is more than a match for the thievish Laban. He flies
   at last with his wives and children; Laban, in hot haste pursues him,
   but the Lord does not leave him; Mizpah's Mount bears witness that God
   can stop the pursuer, and change the foe into a friend. Esau comes
   against him; let Jabbok testify to Jacob's wrestlings, and through the
   power of him who never did forsake his servant, Esau kisses his
   brother, whom once he thought to slay. Anon Jacob dwells in tents and
   booths at Succoth; he journeys up and down throughout the land, and his
   sons treacherously slay the Shechemites. Then the nations round about
   seek to avenge their death, but the Lord again interposes, and Jacob is
   delivered. Poor Jacob is bereaved of his sons. He cries--"Joseph is
   not, and Simeon is not, and now ye will take Benjamin away; all these
   things are against me." But they are not against him; God has not left
   him, for he has not yet done everything that he had spoken to him of.
   The old man goes into Egypt; his lips are refreshed while he kisses the
   cheeks of his favourite Joseph, and until the last, when he gathers up
   his feet in the bed and sings of that coming Shiloh and the scepter
   that should not depart from Judah, good old Jacob proves that in six
   troubles God is with his people, and in seven he doth not forsake them;
   that even to hoar hairs he is the same, and until old age he doth carry
   them. You Jacobs, full of affliction, you tried and troubled heirs of
   heaven, he hath said to you, each one of you--oh! believe him!--I will
   never leave thee; I will never forsake thee."

   2. The next instance in which we find this same promise is in
   Deuteronomy 31:6. Here we find it spoken, not so much to individuals as
   to the whole body collectively. Moses said unto the people of Judah, by
   the Word of God, "Be strong, and of a good courage, fear not, nor be
   afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee;
   he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee." Beloved, we may take this
   promise as being spoken to God's Church, as a Church. These people were
   to fight the accursed nations of Canaan, to drive out the giants, and
   the men who had chariots of iron, but the Lord said he would never
   leave them, nor did he, till from Dan to Beersheba the favored race
   possessed the promised land, and the tribes went up to Jerusalem with
   the voice of joyful song. Now, as the Church of God, let us remember
   that the land lieth before us, and we are called of God to go up and
   possess it. I would it were my lot yet more and more, like Joshua, to
   lead you from one place to another, smiting the enemies of the Lord and
   extending the kingdom of Messias! Let us undertake what we may, we
   shall never fail. Let us, by faith, dare great things, and we shall do
   great things. Let us venture upon notable exploits which shall seem
   fanatical to reason and absurd to men of prudence, for he hath said, "I
   will never leave you nor forsake you." If the Church of God would but
   know that her Lord cannot leave her, she might attempt greater things
   than she has ever done, and the success of her attempts would be most
   certain and sure. God never can forsake a praying people, nor cast off
   a laboring Church; he must bless us even to the end.

   3. The third occasion upon which this promise was made is in Joshua
   1:5, where the Lord says to Joshua, "There shall not any man be able to
   stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I
   will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. "Now this is
   a minister's text. If we be called to lead the people, to bear the
   brunt of the fight, the burden and heat of the day, let us treasure up
   this as our precious consolation, he will not fail us nor forsake us.
   It needs not that I should tell you that it is not every man who can
   stand first in the ranks, and that, albeit there is no small share of
   honor given by God to such a man, yet there is a bitterness in his lot
   which no other men can know. There are times when, if it were not for
   faith, we would give up the ghost, and, were not the Master with us, we
   would turn our back and fly, like Jonah, unto Nineveh. But if any of
   you be called to occupy prominent positions in God's Church, bind this
   about your arm and it shall make you strong; He hath said to you, "I
   will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." Go, in this thy might; the
   Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.

   4. On the next occasion, this same promise was given by David in his
   last moments to his son Solomon, 1 Chronicles 28:20. David was speaking
   of what he himself by experience had proved to be true, and he
   declares--"Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be
   dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not
   fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for
   the service of the house of the Lord." Some Christians are placed where
   they need much prudence, discretion, and wisdom. You may take this for
   your promise. The Queen of Sheba came to see Solomon; she put to him
   many difficult questions, but God did not leave him, nor forsake him,
   and he was able to answer them all. As judge over Israel, many knotty
   points were brought before him; you remember the child and the harlots,
   and how wisely he decided the case. The building of the temple was a
   very mighty work--the like of which the earth had never seen, but, by
   wisdom given to him, the stones were fashioned, and laid one upon
   another, till at last the top stone was brought out with shoutings. You
   shall do the same, O man of business, though yours be a very
   responsible situation. You shall finish your course, O careful worker,
   though there are many eyes that watch for your halting. You shall do
   the same, sister, though you need to have seven eyes rather than two,
   you shall hear the voice of God saying, "This is the way, walk ye in
   it." Thou shalt never be ashamed nor confounded, world without end.

   5. Once more, and perhaps this fifth occasion may be the most
   comforting to the most of you, Isaiah 41:17, "When the poor and needy
   seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I
   the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them."
   You may be brought to this state to-day. Your soul may need Christ, but
   you may not be able to find him. You may feel that without the mercy
   which comes from the atoning blood you are lost. You may have gone to
   works and ceremonies, to prayings and doings, to alms-givings and to
   experiences, and have found them all dried wells, and now you can
   hardly pray, for your tongue cleaves to the roof of your mouth for
   thirst. Now in your worst condition, brought to the lowest state into
   which a creature ever can be cast, Christ will not forsake you, he will
   appear for your help.

   Surely, one of these five occasions must suit you, and let me here
   remind you that whatever God has said to any one saint he has said to
   all. When he opens a well for one man it is that all may drink. When
   the manna falls, it is not only for those in the wilderness, but we by
   faith do eat the manna still. No promise is of private interpretation.
   When God openeth a granary-door to give out food, there may be some one
   starving man who is the occasion of its being opened, but all the
   hungry besides may come and feed too. Whether he gave the word to
   Abraham or to Moses matters not; he has given it to thee as one of the
   covenanted seed. There is not a high blessing too lofty for thee; nor a
   wide mercy too extensive for thee. Lift up now thine eyes to the north
   and to the south, to the east and to the west, for all this is thine.
   Climb to Pisgah's top, and view the utmost limit of the divine promise,
   for the land is all thine own. There is not a brook of living water of
   which thou mayest not drink. If the land floweth with milk and honey,
   eat the honey and drink the milk. The fattest of the kine, yea, and the
   sweetest of the wines, let all be thine, for there is no denial of any
   one of them to any saint. Be thou bold to believe, for he hath said, "I
   will never leave thee, nor forsake thee." To put everything in one,
   there is nothing you can want, there is nothing you can ask for, there
   is nothing you can need in time or in eternity, there is nothing
   living, nothing dying, there is nothing in this world, nothing in the
   next world, there is nothing now, nothing at the resurrection-morning,
   nothing in heaven that is not contained in this text--"I will never
   leave thee; I will never forsake thee."

   IV. I shall give five blows to drive home the nail while I speak upon
   THE SWEET CONFIRMATIONS of this most precious promise.

   1. Let me remind you that the Lord will not and cannot leave his
   people, because of his relationship to them. He is your Father; will
   your Father leave you? Has he not said--"Can a woman forget her sucking
   child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea,
   they may forget, yet will I not forget thee." Would you, being evil,
   leave your child to perish? Never, never! Remember, Christ is your
   husband. Would you, a husband, neglect your wife? Is it not a shame to
   a man, unless he nourisheth and cherisheth her even as his own body,
   and will Christ become one of these ill husbands? Hath he not said--"I
   hate putting away," and will he ever put thee away? Remember, thou art
   part of his body. No man yet ever hated his own flesh. Thou mayest be
   but as a little finger, but will he leave his finger to rot, to perish,
   to starve? Thou mayest be the least honorable of all the members, but
   is it not written that upon these he bestoweth abundant honor, and so
   our uncomely parts have abundant comeliness? If he be father, if he be
   husband, if he be head, if he be all-in-all, how can he leave thee?
   Think not so hardly of thy God.

   2. Then, next, his honor binds him never to forsake thee. When we see a
   house half-built and left in ruins, we say, "This man began to build
   and was not able to finish." Shall this be said of thy God, that he
   began to save thee and could not bring thee to perfection? Is it
   possible that he will break his word, and so stain his truth? Shall men
   be able to cast a slur upon his power, his wisdom, his love, his
   faithfulness? No! thank God, no! "I give," saith he "unto my sheep
   eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck
   them out of my hand." If thou shouldest perish, believer, hell would
   ring with diabolical laughter against the character of God; and if ever
   one whom Jesus undertook to save shouldest perish, then the demons of
   the pit would point the finger of scorn for ever against a defeated
   Christ, against a God that undertook but went not through.

   "His honor is engaged to save

   The meanest of his sheep;

   All that his heavenly Father gave

   His hands securely keep."

   3. And if that be not enough, wilt thou remember besides this that the
   past all goes to prove that he will not forsake thee. Thou hast been in
   deep waters; hast thou been drowned? Thou hast walked through the
   fires; hast thou been burned? Thou hast had six troubles; hath he
   forsaken thee? Thou hast gone down to the roots of the mountains, and
   the weeds have been wrapped about thy head; hath he not brought thee up
   again? Thou hast borne great and sore troubles; but hath he not
   delivered thee? Say, when did he leave thee? Testify against him; if
   thou hast found him forgetful, then doubt him. If thou hast found him
   unworthy of thy confidence, then disown him, but not till then. The
   past is vocal with a thousand songs of gratitude, and every note
   therein proveth by an indisputable logic that he will not forsake his
   people.

   4. And if that be not enough ask thy father and the saints that have
   gone before. Did ever any perish trusting in Christ? I have heard that
   some whom Jehovah loved have fallen from grace, and have been lost. I
   have heard lips of ministers thus prostitute themselves to falsehood,
   but I know that such never was the case. He keepeth all his saints; not
   one of them hath perished; they are in his hand, and have hitherto been
   preserved. David mourneth, "All thy waves and thy billows have gone
   over me;" yet, he crieth, "Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise
   him." Jonah laments, "The earth with her bars was about me for ever;"
   and yet, erelong he says, "Salvation is of the Lord." Ye glorified ones
   above, through much tribulation ye have inherited the kingdom, and
   wearing your white robes, ye smile from your thrones of glory and say
   to us, "Doubt not the Lord, neither distrust him, he hath not forsaken
   his people nor cast off his chosen."

   5. Beloved friends, there is no reason why he should cast us off. Can
   you adduce any reason why he should cast you away? Is it your poverty,
   your nakedness, your peril, the danger of your life? In all these
   things we are more than conquerors through him that hath loved us. Do
   you say it is your sins? Then I answer sin can never be a cause why God
   should cast away his people, for they were full of sin when he at first
   embraced their persons, and espoused their cause. That would have been
   a cause why he never should have loved them, but having loved them when
   they were dead in trespasses and sins, their sin can never be a reason
   for leaving them. Besides, the Apostle says, "I am persuaded that
   neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
   nor things present, nor things to come,"--and sin is one of the things
   present, and I fear it is one of the things to come--"nor height, nor
   depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the
   love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." O child of God, there
   is no fear of your misusing this precious truth. The base-born
   professor of godliness may say, "I will sin, for God will not cast me
   away," but you will not, ye heirs of heaven; rather you will bind this
   about your heart, and say "Now will I love him who having loved his
   own, loves them even unto the end." Glory be to God,

   "'Midst all my sin, and care, and woe,

   His Spirit will not let me go."

   Go, ye slaves that fear the curse of God, and sweat and toil; we are
   his sons, and we know he cannot expel us from his heart. May God
   deliver us from the infamous bondage of the doctrine which makes men
   fear that God may be unfaithful, that Christ may divorce his own
   spouse, may let the members of his own body perish; that he may die for
   them and yet not save them. If there be any truth taught us in
   Scripture, it is that the children of God cannot perish. If this Book
   teaches anything whatever, if it be not all a fiction from beginning to
   end, it teaches in a hundred places that "The righteous shall hold on
   his way, and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger."
   "The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed, but the covenant
   of his love cannot depart from us saith the Lord that hath mercy upon
   us."

   V. And now, fifthly, the SUITABLE CONCLUSIONS to be drawn from this
   doctrine.

   1. One of the first is contentment. The apostle says, "Having food and
   raiment, let us be therewith content, for he hath said, I will never
   leave thee, nor forsake thee." Ishmael, the son of Hagar, had his water
   in a bottle; and he might have laughed at Isaac because Isaac had no
   bottle, but then here was the difference between them--Isaac lived by
   the well. Now some of us have little enough in this world; we have no
   bottle of water, no stock in hand; but then we live by the well, and
   that is better still. To depend upon the daily providence of a faithful
   God, is better than to be worth twenty thousand pounds a year.

   2. Courage is the next lesson. Let us boldly say, "God is my helper,
   why should I fear what man can do unto me." A child of God afraid! Why,
   there is nothing more contrary to his nature. If any would persecute
   you, look them in the face and bear it cheerfully. If they laugh at
   you, let them laugh; you can laugh when they shall howl. If any despise
   you, be content to be despised by fools, and to be misunderstood by
   madmen. It were hard if the world loved us; it is an easy thing if the
   world hateth us. We are so used to be spoken of as altogether vile in
   our motives and selfish in our objects; so used to hear our adversaries
   misconstrue our best words and pull our sentences to pieces, that if
   they were to do anything else but howl, we should think ourselves
   unworthy. "Who art thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of a man that
   shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; and
   forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens,
   and laid the foundations of the earth."

   3. Then next, we ought to cast off our despondency. Some of you came
   here this morning as black as the weather. Just now we saw some gleams
   of sunshine peering through those side windows, until our friends
   hastened to draw the blinds, to shut out the dazzling brightness from
   their eyes; I hope, however, you will not shut out the rays of holy joy
   which break in upon you now. No, since he has said, "I will never leave
   nor forsake thee" leave your troubles in your pews, and bear away a
   song.

   4. And then, my brethren, here is argument for the greatest possible
   delight. How we ought to rejoice with joy unspeakable if He will never
   leave us! Mere songs are not enough; shout for joy all ye that are
   upright in heart.

   5. And, lastly, what ground there is here for faith! Let us lean upon
   our God with all our weight. Let us throw ourselves upon his
   faithfulness as we do upon our beds, bringing all our weariness to his
   dear rest. Now, right on our God let us cast the burdens of our bodies,
   and our souls, for he hath said, "I will never leave thee; I will never
   forsake thee."

   Oh, I wish this promise belonged to you all! I would give my right hand
   if it could! But some of you must not touch it; it does not belong to
   some of you, for it is the exclusive property of the man who trusts in
   Christ. "Oh!" saith one, "then I will trust in Christ." Do it, soul, do
   it; and if thou trustest in him he will never leave thee. Black as thou
   art, he will wash thee; he will never leave thee. Wicked as thou art,
   he will make thee holy, he will never leave thee. Though thou hast
   nought that should win his love, he will press thee to his bosom; he
   will never leave thee. Living or dying, in time or in eternity, he will
   never forsake thee, but will surely bring thee to his right hand, and
   say, "Here am I, and the children whom thou hast given me."

   May God seal these five negatives upon our memories and hearts for
   Christ's sake. Amen.

                       Christ--Perfect Through Sufferings

   A Sermon

   (No. 478)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, November 2nd, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
   things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their
   salvation perfect through sufferings." Hebrews 2:10.

   BELIEVING THAT GOD foreknoweth all things, we cannot but come to the
   conclusion that he foreknow the fall, and that it was but an incident
   in the great method by which he would glorify himself. Foreknowing the
   fall, and fore-ordaining and predestinating the plan by which he would
   rescue his chosen out of the ruins thereof, he was pleased to make that
   plan a manifestation of all his attributes, and, to a very great
   extent, a declaration of his wisdom. You do not find in the method of
   salvation a single tinge of folly. The Greeks may call it folly, but
   they are fools themselves. The gospel is the highest refinement of
   wisdom, ay, of divine wisdom, and we cannot help perceiving that not
   only in its main features, but in its little points, in the details and
   the minutiae, the wisdom of God is most clearly to be seen. Just as in
   the making of the tabernacle in the wilderness not a single loop or
   tache was left to human chance or judgment, so in the great scheme of
   salvation, not a single fragment was left to the human will or to the
   folly of the flesh. It appears to be a law of the divine action that
   everything must be according to the fitness and necessity involved in
   perfect wisdom--"It behoved that Christ should suffer;" and in our text
   we find, "It became him from whom are all things and by whom are all
   things, in bringing many sons unto glory, that he should make the
   captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings." It seemed to be
   but the order of natural fitness and congruity, in accordance with the
   nature and character of God, that the plan of salvation should be just
   what it is. Oh! how careful should we be who have to preach it never to
   alter it in the slightest degree. How should we lift our prayers to
   heaven that God would give us a clear understanding, first, of what we
   have to teach, and then a clear method of teaching what we have
   learned, so that no mistake may be made here, for a mistake here would
   mar that express image of God which shines in the gospel, and prevent
   our hearers from seeing the beautiful fitness and proportion which are
   so adapted to reveal the perfect character of God. We say the plan must
   be what it is; it could not be otherwise so as to be in keeping with
   the divine character; and, therefore, it is imperative upon us that we
   make no alteration in it, no, not of a word, lest we should hear the
   Apostle's anathema hissing through the air like a thunderbolt from
   God--"If we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than that
   ye have received let him be accursed!"

   Our text invites us to the consideration of three particulars: first,
   that Christ is a perfect Savior; secondly, that he became so through
   suffering; and thirdly, that his being made perfect through suffering
   will ennoble and dignify the whole work of grace. "It became him"--it
   seemed fitting--that in bringing many sons unto glory he should make
   the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings."

   I. To begin, then, first of all with the joyous thought, so well known
   to you all, but so necessary still to be repeated, that THE LORD JESUS
   IS A PERFECT SAVIOR.

   1. For, first, he is perfectly adapted for the work of saving. The
   singular constitution of his nature adapts him to his office. He is
   God. It was necessary that he should be so. Who but God could sustain
   the enormous weight of human guilt? What but Divinity was equal to bear
   the awful load of wrath which was to be carried upon his shoulders?
   What knowledge but Omniscience could understand all the evil, and what
   power but Omnipotence could undo that evil? That Christ is God must
   ever be a theme for grateful admiration to his people. They who reject
   the divinity of Christ can have but a poor foundation to rest upon; the
   fickle sand, would seem to be more stable than the basis of their hope.
   It is enough for one man to work out his own obedience; more than
   enough for one man to bear wrath for himself; how, then, could he do it
   for others, and for those countless multitudes whose ruin was to be
   retrieved? But, beloved, we know that had he only been God yet still he
   would not have been fitted for a perfect Savior, unless he had become
   man. Man had sinned; man must suffer. It was man in whom God's purposes
   had been for a while defeated; it must be in man that God must triumph
   over his great enemy. He must take upon himself the seed of Abraham,
   that he may stand in their room and stead, and become their federal
   head. An angel, we believe, could not have suffered on the tree; it
   would not have been possible for an angelic nature to have borne those
   agonies which the wrath of God demanded as an expiation for guilt. But
   when we see the Lord Jesus before us, being verily the Son of Man, and
   as certainly the Son of God, we perceive that now Job's desire is
   granted; we have a daysman that can lay his hand on both, and touch
   humanity in its weakness, and divinity in its strength; can make a
   ladder between earth and heaven; can bridge the distance which
   separates fallen manhood from the perfection of the eternal God. No
   nature but one so complex as that of Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God,
   would have been perfectly adapted for the work of salvation.

   And as he was adapted in his nature, so, beloved, it is very clear to
   us that he was also adapted by his experience. A physician should have
   some acquaintance with disease; how shall he know the remedy if he be
   ignorant of the malady. Our Savior knew all because "he took our
   infirmities and he bare our sicknesses. He was tempted in all points,
   like as we are." He looked not at sin from the distance of heaven but
   he walked, and lived in the midst of it. He did not pass hurriedly
   through the world as one might hastily walk through an hospital without
   clearly understanding the disease, but he lived his more than thirty
   years in the very center of it, seeing sin in all its shapes; yes,
   seeing it in shapes that you and I have not yet seen. He saw it in
   demoniac forms, for hell was let loose for a season, that the combat
   might be the more terrible and the victory the more glorious. He saw
   sin carried to its most aggravated extent, when it crucified God
   himself, and nailed Jesus, the heir of heaven, to the accursed tree. He
   understood the disease; he was no empiric; he had studied the whole
   case through; deceitful as the human heart is, Jesus knew it; fickle as
   it is in its various appearances--Protean as it is in its constantly
   varying shapes, Christ knew and understood it all. His life-long
   walking of the hospital of human nature had taught him the disease. He
   knew the subjects, too, upon whom to operate. He knew man, and what was
   in man; yes, better than the most skilled surgeon can know by
   experiment. He knew by experience. He himself took our infirmities and
   bare our sorrows. He was himself the patient, himself the medicine. He
   took upon himself the nature of the race he came to save, and so every
   feeling made him perfect in his work; every pang instructed him; every
   throb of anguish made him wise, and rendered him the more accomplished
   to work out the purposes of God in the bringing of the many sons unto
   glory. If you will add to his perfect experience his marvellous
   character, you will see how completely adapted he was to the work. For
   a Savior, we need one who is full of love, whose love will make him
   firm to his purpose, whose love will constrain him to yoke every power
   and talent that he has to the great work. We want one with zeal so
   flaming, that it will eat him up; of courage so indomitable, that he
   will face every adversary rather than forego his end; we want one, at
   the same time, who will blend with this brass of courage the gold of
   meekness and of gentleness; we want one who will be determined to deal
   fearlessly with his adversaries, who will put on zeal as a cloak, and
   will deal tenderly and compassionately with the disease of sin-sick
   men, such an one we have in Christ. No man can read the character of
   Christ with any sort of understanding without saying, "That is the man
   I want as my friend." The argument which Christ used was a very
   powerful one--"Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me." Why? "For I am
   meek and lowly in heart." The character of Christ qualifies him to be
   the world's Savior, and there is something in his character, when
   properly understood, which is so attractive, that we may well say--

   "His worth if all the nations knew,

   Sure the whole world would love him too."

   If we had to make a Savior ourselves, and it were left to a parliament
   of the wisest senators of the race to form an ideal personage who
   should just meet man's case, if the Divine One had lent us his own
   wisdom for the occasion, we could only have desired just such a person
   as Christ is. In character, we should have needed just such traits of
   nature and of spirit as we see in Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God. We
   think, therefore, we may safely say to every unconverted man, Christ is
   adapted to be a Savior to you. We know that the saints, without our
   saying it, will respond, "Ay, and he is just fitted to be a Savior to
   us." Man, yet God; bone of our bone, and yect counting it no robbery to
   be equal with God; sufferer like ourselves, bearer of all the ills of
   manhood, and yet, unlike us, free from sin, holy, harmless, undefiled:
   qualified in all respects to undertake and accomplish the great work;
   Jesus, thou art a perfect Savior to us.

   2. Furthermore, as Christ is thus perfectly adapted, so he is perfectly
   able to be a Savior. He is a perfect Savior by reason of ability. He is
   now able to meet all the needs of sinners. That need is very great. The
   sinner needs everything. The beggar at the door of Christ, asks not for
   crumbs or groats, but needs all that Christ can give. Nothing short of
   all-sufficiency can ever meet the wants of a poor son of Adam fallen by
   sin. Christ Jesus hath all fullness dwelling in himself. "More than all
   in Christ we find:" pardon in his blood; justification in his
   righteousness; wisdom in his teaching; sanctification in his Spirit. He
   is the God of all grace to us. Deep as our miseries and boundless as
   our sins may be, the mines of his unfathomable love, his grace, and his
   power, exceed them still. Send a spirit throughout all nations to hunt
   up the most abject of all races; discover, at last, a tribe of men
   degenerated as low as the beasts; select out of these the vilest, one
   who has been a cannibal; bring before us one lost to all sense of
   morality, one who has put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter, light
   for darkness and darkness for light; let that man be red with murder,
   let him be black with lust; let villainies infest his heart as
   innumerable and detestable as the frogs of Egypt's plague--yet Christ
   is able to meet that man's case. It is impossible for us to produce an
   exaggeration of the work of sin and the devil, which Christ shall not
   be able to overtop by the plenitude of his power. "He is able to save
   unto the uttermost them that come unto God by him." That divine word
   which made heaven and earth, is able to make a new creature in Christ
   Jesus; and that power which never can be exhausted, which after making
   ten thousand times ten thousand worlds could make as many morel is all
   in Christ, and is linked with the virtue of his merit and the
   prevalence of his blood, and therefore he hath all power in heaven and
   in earth to save souls. As he has this power to meet all needs, so he
   can meet all need in all cases. There has never been brought to Christ
   a man whom he could not heal. If born blind, a touch of his finger has
   given sight; if lame he has made him leap like a hart; ay, and though
   dead, the voice of Christ has made Lazarus come forth from his tomb.
   Some troubled consciences think their case is not in the list of
   possible cures, let us assure them it must be. I would like to know who
   is the vilest sinner, for if I knew him I should feel delighted to
   behold him, since I should see a platform upon which my Lord's grace
   might stand to be the more gloriously resplendent in the eyes of men.
   Are you the vilest of the vile this morning? Do you feel so? Does Satan
   say you are so? Then I pray you do my Master the honor to believe that
   he is still able to meet your case, and that he can save even you.
   Though you think yourselves the ends of the earth, the very ravellings
   of the garment of manhood, yet "look unto him and be ye saved, all ye
   ends of the earth, for he is God, and besides him there is none else."
   As he can meet all cases, so he can meet all cases at all times. One
   villainy of hell is to tell sinners that it is too late. While the lamp
   holds out to burn, the vilest sinner that returns shall find mercy in
   him. At the eleventh hour he saved the thief; let not this be a reason
   for your procrastination--that were ungrateful let it, however, be a
   cause for hope--that were reasonable. He is able to save you now. Now,
   at this hour, at this very moment, if thou dost trust him thou art
   saved. If now, without an hour's delay to retire to thy chamber,
   without even five minutes' time elapsing in which to prepare thy soul
   for him, if now thou canst believe that Christ can save thee, he will
   do it, do it at this moment. His cures are instantaneous; a word, and
   it is done. Swift as the lightning's flash is the accomplishment of his
   purpose of grace. As the lightning flasheth from the west even to the
   east, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be at his last great
   advent; and so is it in his marvellous advent into the hearts of
   sinners whom he ordains to save. Able to meet all cases, able to meet
   them at this very hour is Christ. Sinner, Christ is perfectly able to
   save thee, and to save thee perfectly. I know the will and wit of man
   want to be doing something to begin salvation. Oh, how wicked is this!
   Christ is Alpha, why would you take his place and be an Alpha to
   yourselves? I have had this week two cases in which I have had to hold
   a solemn argument with troubled souls about this matter. Oh! the "ifs"
   and "buts" they put; the "perhaps," and "and," and "peradventures," and
   "Oh, I don't feel this," and "I don't feel that!" Oh, that wicked
   questioning of Christ! While talking with them, endeavoring to comfort
   them, and I hope not unsuccessfully, I was led to feel in my own mind
   what an awful crime it is to doubt God, to doubt Him that speaks from
   above, to doubt Him when he hangs bleeding on the tree. While it seemed
   to me to be such a hard thing to bring a sinner to trust Christ, yet it
   did seem, on the other hand, such a sin of sins, such a master-piece of
   iniquity that we do not trust Christ at once. Here is the plan of
   salvation--trust Christ and he will save you. But they say "I do not
   feel enough;" or else "I have been such a sinner;" or else "I cannot
   feel the joy I want;" or else "I cannot pray as I would." Then I put it
   to them. Do you trust Christ? "Yes," they will say, "I do trust Christ,
   and yet am not saved." Now, this makes God a liar, for he says, "He
   that believeth in him is not condemned, and he that believeth on him
   hath everlasting life." When a soul professes to trust Christ, and yet
   says "I am afraid he will not save me," what is this but telling the
   Eternal God to his face that he is false? Can you suppose a grosser
   infamy than this? Oh! that men were wise, that they would take God at
   his word, and believe that Christ is a perfect Savior, not asking them
   to help him at the first, but able to begin with them just where they
   are, and to lift them up from all the hardness of their hearts and the
   blackness of their souls to the very gates of heaven. He is a perfect
   Savior, soul, and a perfect Savior for you. You know the old story of
   the brazen serpent. There may have been some very wise persons who,
   when the brazen serpent was lifted up, would say "I cannot look there
   and be healed, for, you see, I do not feel the venom in my veins as my
   next door neighbor does." The man is bitten, and his veins are
   swelling, but he says he does not feel the pain so acutely as his
   neighbor, and he does not feel the joy of those who are healed, or else
   he would look. "If some angel would come," he says, "and tell me that
   the brazen serpent was set up on purpose for me, and that I am ordained
   to be healed by it, then I would look." There is a poor ignorant man
   over there who asks no questions but does just as he is told. Moses
   cries "Look, look, ye dying; look and live!" and, asking no questions
   about what he has felt, or what he was, or what he should feel, yonder
   poor soul just looks and the deed is done; the flush of health runs
   through him, and he is restored, while the questioner, the wise man in
   his oval conceit, too wise indeed, to do as he is told, perishes
   through his own folly, a victim to the serpents, but yet more a victim
   to his own conceit. Christ is a perfect Savior to begin with you, and
   he will also be a perfect Savior to carry on the work. He will never
   want your help; he is a perfect Savior to finish the work. He will
   bring you at last to his right-hand, and throned with him in light you
   shall bless and praise the name of God that He provided a perfect
   Savior for men.

   3. Once more, let me remind you that Christ is a perfectly successful
   Savior. I mean by this that, in one sense, he has already finished the
   work of salvation. All that has to be done to save a soul Christ has
   done already. There is no more ransom to be paid; to the last drachma
   he hath counted down the price. There is no more righteousness to be
   wrought out; to the last stitch he has finished the garment. There is
   nothing to be done to reconcile God to sinners; he hath reconciled us
   unto God by his blood. There is nothing wanted to clear the way to the
   mercy-seat; we have a new and living way through the veil that was
   rent, even the body of Christ. There is no need of any preparation for
   our reception on the part of God. "It is finished," was the voice from
   Calvary; it meant what it said, "It is finished." Christ hath finished
   transgression, made an end of sin, and brought in everlasting
   righteousness. And, as he has been successful in doing all the work for
   us, so, in every case where that work has been applied, perfect success
   has followed. Produce a single case where an application has been made
   to Christ without success. Find a single soul in whom Christ has
   commenced his work, and then left it. You do hear of some who fall from
   grace: produce them. We are told of some who are children of God
   to-day, and children of the devil to-morrow: produce them. We are told
   that whom once he loves he may leave; produce those whom he has ever
   left. Let them be seen. Hold them up to the gaze of men and devils--the
   patients in whom Christ's medicine did work awhile, but failed to
   produce a lasting cure. Heaven were clothed in sackcloth if such a
   discovery were made, for if he hath failed to keep on earth, why not in
   heaven? Hell were echoing with infernal laughter if one such instance
   were found, for where were the honor of God's word and promise? We
   challenge you, ye princes of darkness, and ye who make the vast
   assembly of the damped in hell, we challenge you to produce in all your
   ranks a single case of one who trusted in Christ that he would deliver
   him and yet Christ cast him away; or one in whom the new spirit was
   infused and regeneration wrought, and who yet, after all fell and
   perished like the rest. Lift up your eyes to heaven; innumerable as the
   stars are the spirits redeemed by blood; so many as they are, they are
   all witnesses to the fact that Christ is a perfect Savior; that he is
   no professor who does not perform, for he has carried them all there,
   and as we gaze upon them are can say, "Thou hast redeemed them unto God
   by thy blood;" thou canst save, and perfectly save, O Lord Jesus
   Christ.

   Now I have thus dwelt upon the perfect adaptation, the perfect ability,
   and the perfect success of Christ, our text tells us that it became him
   for whom are all things that he should give us such a Savior. "For whom
   are all things," says the Apostle; that is, all things are made for his
   glory. Now, it could not have been for God's glory to give us an
   imperfect Savior; to send us one who would mock us with hopes which
   could not be fulfilled. It would have been a tantalizing of human hope,
   which I do not hesitate to pronounce an awful cruelty, if any but a
   complete and perfect Savior had been presented to us. If it had been
   partly works and partly grace, there had been no grace in it. If it had
   been needful for us to do something to make Christ's atonement
   efficacious, it would have been no atonement for us; we must have gone
   down to the pit of hell with this as an aggravation, that a God who
   professed to be a God of mercy had offered us a religion of which we
   could not avail ourselves; a hope which did but delude us, and make our
   darkness the blacker. I want to know what some of my brethren in the
   ministry, who preach such very high doctrine, do with their God's
   character. They are told to preach the gospel to every creature, but
   they very wisely do not do it, because they feel that the gospel they
   preach is not a gospel suitable to every creature; so they neglect
   their Master's mandate, and single out a few. I bless my Master that I
   have an available gospel, one that is available to you this morning,
   for "whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting
   life," and I hold that it were inconsistent with the character of him
   "for whom are all things," and that it were derogatory to his honor if
   he should have sent to you a salvation that would not meet your case;
   if he should have sent me to preach a gospel to you which could not
   completely save. But, glory be to God, the salvation which is here
   preached, the salvation taught in this Book, brings all to you, and
   asks nothing from you.

   Moreover, Paul calls our God--"him by whom are all things." It would be
   inconsistent with the character of him by whom are all things if he had
   sent a part-Savior; for us to do part ourselves, and for Christ to do
   the rest. Look at the sun. God wills for the sun to light the earth;
   doth he ask the earth's darkness to contribute to the light? Doth he
   question night, and ask it whether it has not in its sombre shades
   something which it may contribute to the brightness of noon? No, my
   brethren, up rises the sun in the morning, like a giant to run his
   race, and the earth is made bright. And shall God turn to the dark
   sinner, and ask him whether there is anything in him that may
   contribute to eternal light? No; up rises the face of Jesus, like the
   Sun of Righteousness, with healing beneath his wings, and darkness is,
   at his coming, light. See ye, too, the showers. When the earth is
   thirsty and cracking, doth the Lord say unto the clouds, "Wait ye until
   the earth can help ye, and can minister unto its own fertility?" Nay,
   verily, but the wind bloweth and the clouds cover the sky, and upon the
   thirsty earth the refreshing showers come down. So is it with Christ;
   waiting not for man, and tarrying not for the Son of Man; asking
   nothing from us, he giveth us of his own rich grace, and is a complete
   and perfect Savior.

   Thus much, then, upon our first head; I would we had more time for our
   second; but we will pass to it at once.

   II. CHRIST WAS MADE A PERFECT SAVIOR THROUGH SUFFERING.

   He was not made perfect in character by his suffering, for he always
   was perfect--perfect God, perfect man; but he was made officially
   perfect, perfect as the captain of our salvation through his
   sufferings, and that in four ways.

   By his sufferings he became perfect as a Savior from having offered a
   complete expiation for sin. Sin could not have been put away by
   holiness. The best performance of an unsuffering being could not have
   removed the guilt of man. Suffering was absolutely necessary, for
   suffering was the penalty of sin. "In the day thou eatest thereof,"
   said God to Adam, "thou shalt surely die." Die then he must. Nothing
   short of death could meet the case. Christ must go to the cross; he
   must suffer there; ay, and he must bow his head and give up the ghost,
   or else no atonement for sin had been possible. The curse came upon us
   as the result of sin. "Curseth is every one that continueth not in all
   things written in the book of the law to do them." Now had Christ been
   never so perfect, yet had he never suffered he never could have taken
   our curse. "Cursed is every one that hangeth on the tree," but without
   the tree, without the cross, Christ had not been our substitute, and
   all he did could have been of no sort of use to us. Being crucified he
   became accursed; being crucified he died, and thus he could make
   perfect expiation for sin. Sin demanded punishment; punishment must
   consist of loss and of pain; Christ lost everything, even to the
   stripping of his garment; his glory was taken from him; they made
   nothing of him; they spat in his face; they bowed the knee, and mocked
   him with bitter irony. There must be pain too, and he endured it; in
   his body there were the wounds and the fever which the wounds produced,
   and in his soul there was an exceeding heaviness even unto death, and
   an agony which no tongue can tell, for we have no words in which to
   speak of it. We believe that this agony was commensurate with the
   agonies of the lost in hell; not the same agony, but an equivalent for
   it; and remember, not the equivalent for the agony of one, but an
   equivalent for the hells of all that innumerable host whose sins he
   bore, condensed into one black draught to be drained in a few hours;
   the miseries of an eternity without an end, miseries caused by a God
   infinitely angry because of an awful rebellion, and these miseries
   multiplied by the millions for whom the man Christ Jesus stood as
   covenant head. What a draught was that, men and brethren! Well might it
   stagger even him! And yet he drained that cup, drained it to its utmost
   dregs not a drop was left. For thee, my soul, no flames of hell; for
   Christ the Paschal-lamb has been roasted in that fire. For thee, my
   soul, no torments of the damned, for Christ hath been condemned in thy
   stead. For thee, my spirit, no desertion of thy God, for He was
   forsaken of God for thee. 'Tis done, 'tis finished, and by thy
   sufferings, Jesus, thou hast become perfect as the expiation of thy
   people's sins. Do, my brethren, remember that your sins are perfectly
   expiated. Do not let them trouble you as to punishment; the punishment
   has gone. Sins cannot lie in two places at one time; they were put on
   Christ, and they cannot be on you. In fact, your sins are not to be
   found; the scapegoat has gone, and your sins will never be found again.
   Your sins, if they were searched for, could not be discovered, nor by
   the piercing eye of God can a single blemish be found in you. So far as
   the punishment of the law is concerned it is finished, and Christ is a
   perfect Savior.

   Again, if Christ had not suffered he could not have been perfect as a
   Savior, because he could not have brought in a perfect righteousness.
   It is not enough to expiate sin. God requires of man perfect obedience.
   If man would be in heaven he must be perfectly obedient. Christ, as he
   took away our guilt, has supplied us with a matchless righteousness.
   His works are our works; his doings are, by imputation, our doings. But
   a part of obedience is a patient endurance of God's will. Patience is
   no mean part of the full obedience of a sincere soul. Christ must
   therefore suffer hunger, and cold, and nakedness throughout life, that
   he may be capable of the virtue of patience. An obedience even unto
   death is now the only perfect form of obedience. The man who would keep
   the law of God perfectly must not start back even at martyrdom. "Thou
   shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and
   with all thy strength," would now require death to consummate it. It
   was not possible for the Master to have made the robe, woven from the
   top throughout without seam, unless the scarlet thread of crucifixion
   had run along its edge. But now, my soul, Christ is thy perfect Savior,
   for he presents thee with a perfect righteousness. There is nothing
   more to do. Neither my living nor my dying can make my righteousness
   more complete. No doing, no Iabouring, no denying, no suffering, are
   needed to finish that which Christ began. "It is finished." Put on thy
   robe, O Christian; walk ever in it; let it be thy wedding-dress. Angels
   admire thee; God himself accepts thee; coming into his wedding-feast he
   sees thee with this garment on, and he asks thee not how thou comest
   hither, but bids thee sit down and feast for ever, for thou art such as
   even He can keep company with in his glory.

   Yet, thirdly, it was necessary that Christ should suffer to make him a
   perfect Savior so far as his sympathy goes. After sin is washed away,
   and righteousness imputed, we yet want a friend, for we are in a land
   of troubles and of sorrows. Now, if Christ had not suffered he could
   not have been a faithful high-priest, made like unto his brethren. We
   should never have had that sweet text--"He was tempted in all points,
   like as we are, yet without sin," if he had not suffered. But now he
   knows all shapes of suffering. It is not possible that even out of the
   thousands now in this house there should be one heart whose case Christ
   cannot meet.

   "In every pang that rends the heart

   The man of sorrows had a part."

   Disease, sickness of body, poverty, need, friendlessness, hopelessness,
   desertion--he knows all these. You cannot cast human suffering into any
   shape that is new to Christ. "In all their afflictions he was
   afflicted." If you feel a thorn in your foot, remember that it once
   pierced his head. If you have a trouble or a difficulty, you may see
   there the mark of his hands, for he has climbed that way before. The
   whole path of sorrow has his blood-bedabbled footsteps all along, for
   the Man of Sorrows has been there, and he can now have sympathy with
   you. "Yes," I hear one say, "but my sorrows are the result of sin." So
   were his; though not his own, yet the result of sin they were. "Yes,"
   you say, "but I am slandered, and I cannot bear it." They called him a
   drunken man, and a wine-bibber. Why, when you once think of the
   sufferings of Christ, yours are not worth a thought. Like the small
   dust of a balance that may be blown away with the breath of an infant,
   such are our agonies and our trials when compared with his. Drink thy
   little cup; see what a cup he drained. The little vinegar and gall that
   fall to thy share thou mayest gladly recede, for these light
   afflictions, which are but for a moment, are not worthy to be compared
   to the sufferings through which he passed.

   Finally, upon this point; he thus became perfect as our exemplar. This,
   too, was necessary in bringing many sons unto glory, for we come to
   heaven by following the example of Christ, as well as by being washed
   in his blood. "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord;" that
   holiness is best of all promoted by an investigation of Christ's
   character, and a studious imitation of all its points. Now had Christ
   not suffered he could not have been an example to us. We should have
   said, "Yes, yes, he may be an example to unsuffering angels, but not to
   men who have to tread the hot coals of the furnace." He could have
   afforded no example of patience if he had never suffered; he could
   never have taught us to forgive if he had never felt injuries; he could
   not have trained us to holy courage if he had never fought a battle; he
   could never have shown us the way to make tribulation work experience,
   and experience hope, if through tribulation he had not himself waded to
   his throne. We want not an example taken from princes to be applied to
   peasants. We need a poor man to be an example for the poor; we want a
   man who lives in private to teach us how to live in retirement; we want
   one who fears not the face of crowds to show us how to walk in our
   public ways. We want, if we would meet the case of fallen humanity, a
   man just like the Savior, who passed through all the various phases of
   life, was in all companies, was shot at from all quarters, was tempted
   in all points like as we are, and this could not have been if he had
   been led in quiet ways along a path of joy. He must do business on the
   tempestuous deeps; his ship must rock, his anchor drag, the thick
   darkness and the lightnings must gather round him; they did so, and
   thus the captain of our salvation was made perfect through suffering,
   as an example for our imitation. I would that we might each of us know
   him in the efficacy of his blood, in the glory of his righteousness, in
   the sweetness of his sympathy, and in the perfection of his example,
   for then should we know him to the joy of our hearts for ever.

   III. And now, lastly, our point--CHRIST'S HAVING BEEN MADE PERFECT
   THROUGH SUFFERING WILL ENNOBLE THE WHOLE WORK OF GRACE.

   "It became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in
   bringing many sons unto glory "--that is the great work--"to make the
   captain of their salvation perfect through suffering." The whole thing
   will work for his glory. Oh, my brethren, how this will glorify God at
   the last, that Christ, the man, should have been perfect through
   suffering! How this will glorify him in the eyes of devils! Looking
   upwards from their beds of fire where they bite their iron bands in
   vain, how will they see the wisdom and power of God as more than a
   match for the wisdom and might of their leader! It was in man that they
   defeated God; in man God destroys them. They trampled on man's heel;
   man has broken their head. They took away from man the transient crown
   of his Eden-glory; man wears the unfading crown of immortality. Man,
   even man, sits upon the throne of Godhead, and that man crowned with
   light and glory everlasting was a man who did encounter Satan; who met
   him, too, on fair grounds; not a man shielded from pain; not a man who
   had an immunity from internal or external distress; but a man full of
   weakness, full of infirmity, like other men, and yet, through God in
   alliance with his manhood, more than a conqueror, and now reigning for
   ever and ever. Milton, I think it is, supposes that this may have been
   the reason for Satan's first rebellion, because he could not bear that
   an inferior race should be lifted up to be set above himself on God's
   throne. Whether this be so or not, it must certainly be an aggravation
   to the misery of that proud arch-traitor, that now the man, the man,
   the man in whose image God was defeated, is heir of all things, King of
   kings, and Lord of lords.

   How greatly will God be exalted that day in the eyes of lost spirits.
   Ah! ye that shall perish--God grant there may be none such here!--if
   you shall ever perish in hell, you will have to glorify God as you see
   Christ, who was made perfect through suffering, reigning there. You
   will not be able to say, "My damnation lies at God's door," for you
   will see in Christ a suitable Savior. You will have to look up and say,
   "Yes, he who was preached to me on Sabbath-days was God; he could save
   me. He whom I was bidden to trust in was man, and could sympathise with
   me, but I would not come unto him that I might have life." In letters
   of fire ye shall see it written, "Ye knew your duty, but ye did it
   not;" and even your moans and groans as ye suffer shall be but an
   utterance of this awful truth--"Great God, thou art just, nay, thou art
   doubly just; just, first, in damning me for sin, just, next, in
   trampling me under foot, because I trampled under foot the blood of the
   Son of God and counted his covenant an unholy thing." Your weepings and
   wailings shall be but the deep bass of the awful praise which the whole
   universe, willingly or unwillingly, must give to him who has provided a
   perfect Savior, and made him perfect through suffering.

   Oh, my brethren, what delight and transport will seize the minds of
   those who are redeemed! How will God ho glorified then! Why, every
   wound of Christ will cause an everlasting song. As we shall circle his
   throne, rejoicing, will not this be the very summit of all our
   harmony--"Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us unto God by thy blood."
   We must not say what God could do or could not do, but it does seem to
   me that by no process of creation could he have ever made such beings
   as we shall be when we are brought to heaven; for if he had made us
   perfect yet then we should have stood through our own holiness; or if
   he had forgiven us without an atonement then we should never have seen
   his justice, nor his amazing love. But in heaven we shall be creatures
   who feel that we have everything but deserve nothing; creatures that
   have been the objects of the most wonderful love, and therefore so
   mightly attached to our Lord that it would be impossible for a thousand
   Satans ever to lead us astray. Again. We shall be such servants as even
   the angels cannot be, for we shall feel under deeper obligation to God
   than even they. They are but created happy; we shall be redeemed by the
   blood of God's dear Son, and I am sure, brethren, day without night we
   shall circle God's throne rejoicing, having more happiness than the
   angels, for they do not know what evil is, but we shall have known it
   to the full, and yet shall be perfectly free from it. They do not know
   what pain is, but we shall have known pain, and grief, and death, and
   yet shall be immortal. They do not know what it is to fall, but we
   shall look down to the depths of hell and remember that these were our
   portion. Oh! how we will sing, how we will chant his praise, and this,
   I say again, shall be the highest note, that we owe all to that bright
   one, that Lamb in the midst of the throne. We will tell it over, and
   over, and over again, and find it an inexhaustible theme for melodious
   joy and song that he became man, that he sweat great drops of blood,
   that he died, that he rose again. While the angels are singing
   "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!" we will bid them stop
   the song a moment, while we say, "He whom ye thus adore was once
   covered with bloody sweat." As we cast our crowns at his feet, we will
   say, "And he was once despised and rejected of men." Lifting up our
   eyes and saluting him as God over all, blessed for ever, we will
   remember the reed, the sponge, the vinegar, and the nails; and as we
   come to him and have fellowship with him, and he shall lead us beside
   the living fountains of water, we will remember the black brook of
   Kedron of which he drank, and the awful depths of the grave into which
   he descended. Amid all the splendours of heaven, we shall never forget
   the agony, and misery, and dishonor of earth; and even when they sing
   the loudest sonnets of God's love, and power, and grace, we will sing
   this after all, and before all, and above all, that Jesus the Son of
   God died for us, and this shall be our everlasting song--"He loved us
   and gave himself for us, and we have washed our robes, and made them
   white in the blood of the Lamb."

                               Christian Sympathy

   A Sermon for the Lancashire Distress

   (No. 479)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, November 9th, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved
   for the poor?"--Job 30:25.

   IN ENDEAVORING TO JUSTIFY the ways of God, Job's three friends came to
   the harsh conclusion that he would not have been so severely afflicted
   if he had not been a very great sinner. Among other accusations against
   the afflicted patriarch, Eliphaz the Temanite had the cruelty to lay
   this at his door, "Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and
   thou hast withholden bread from the hungry." Such a slander we may
   describe as "speaking wickedly for God," for in his ignorance of the
   great laws of Providence towards the saints in this life, the Temanite
   had uttered falsehood in order to account for the divine procedure.
   God's own testimony of Job is that he was "a perfect and an upright
   man, one that feared God and eschewed evil;" and certainly he could
   never have earned the character of "perfect" if he had been devoid of
   pity for the poor. Richly did the three miserable comforters deserve
   the burning rebuke of their slandered friend, "Ye are forgers of lies,
   ye are physicians of no value. O that ye would altogether hold your
   peace and it shall be your wisdom."

   Job, in his great indignation at the shameful accusation of unkindness
   to the needy, pours forth the following very solemn imprecation--"If I
   have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of
   the widow to fail; or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the
   fatherless hath not eaten thereof; if I have seen any perish for want
   of clothing, or any poor without covering; if his loins have not
   blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; if I
   have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in
   the gate: then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm
   be broken from the bone." Thus vehemently making a tremendous appeal to
   heaven, he shakes off the slander into the fire as Paul shook the viper
   from his hand. I trust there are many present who, if the like charge
   should be laid to their door, might as boldly deny it; not in the same
   form of imprecation, for that is forbidden to the Christian man, but
   with all the positiveness which can dwell in the "Yea, yea, "Nay, nay"
   of the followers of Jesus. I trust that many of you can in your measure
   use the language of the man of Uz, and say, "When the ear heard me,
   then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
   because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him
   that had none to help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish
   came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy." In the
   two questions of my text Job claims something more than merely having
   helped the poor with gifts, he declares that he wept and grieved for
   them. His charity was of the heart. He considered their case; laid
   their sorrows to his own soul, and lent his eyes to weep and his heart
   to mourn. "Did I not weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul
   grieved for the poor?" Human sympathy is the subject of our present
   meditation, and I shall labor to excite in you those emotions which are
   the genuine result of sympathy when it is truly felt. Practical
   sympathy is my aim; I trust your liberality, at the end of the sermon,
   will prove that I have hit the center of my target.

   Human sympathy, then, its commendations, its hindrances, its sure
   fruits, and its special application to the case in hand this morning.

   I. HUMAN SYMPATHY, ITS COMMENDATIONS.

   1. We may say of it, first, that even nature dictateth that man should
   feel a sympathy for his kind. Humanity, had it remained in its unfallen
   estate would have been one delightful household of brothers and
   sisters. If our first parents had never sinned, we should have been one
   unbroken family, the home of peace, the abode of love. The fact that
   "God hath made of one blood all nations that dwell upon the face of the
   earth" would then have been a realized and established truth; no
   nationalities would have divided, or personal interests separated us.
   Having one common Father, one loving God, one blissful Paradise, our
   lives would have been one long heaven on earth of sweetly intermingled
   peace, love, joy, fellowship, and purity. One can hardly indulge a
   conception of such a happy world without an intense regret that the
   fall has made it all a dream--yet let us dream a moment of a world
   without a soldier, without sword, or spear, or shield; a world without
   a prison, a magistrate, or a chain; a society in which none will wrong
   his fellow, but each is anxious for the well-being of all; a race
   needing no exhortation to virtue, for virtue is its very life; a land
   where love has knit all natures into unity and breathed one soul into a
   thousand bodies! Alas! for us, when Adam fell he not only violated his
   Maker's laws, but in the fill he broke the unity of the race, and now
   we are isolated particles of manhood, instead of being what we should
   have been, members of one body, moved by one and the same spirit. The
   dream may vanish but we lose not our argument, for even in fallen
   humanity there are some palpitations of the one heart, some signs of
   the "one blood." Flesh and blood are able to make the revelation that
   we were not made to live unto ourselves. Fallen and debased as man is,
   and this pulpit is not prone to flatter human nature, yet we cannot;
   but recognize the generous feeling towards the poor and suffering which
   exists in many an unregenerate heart. We have known men who have
   forgotten God, but who, nevertheless, do not forget the poor; who
   despise their Maker's laws, but yet have a heart that melts at a tale
   of woe. It were folly to dispute that some who deny the God that made
   them, have yet exhibited bowels of compassion to the poor and needy.
   When even publicans and harlots can exhibit sympathy, how much more
   should it burn in the Christian heart; we should do more than others or
   else we shall hear the Master say, "What thank have ye? for sinners
   also do even the same." Called with a nobler calling, let us exhibit as
   the result of our regenerate nature a loftier compassion for the
   suffering sons of men. Many interesting incidents have been recorded by
   naturalists of sympathy among animals; the "dumb driven cattle" of our
   pastures, and the dogs of our streets have manifested commiseration
   towards a suffering one of their own species; and we are less than men,
   we are worse than brute beasts if we can enjoy abundance without
   sharing our bread with the starving, if we can be wrapt in comfort and
   refuse a garment to the shivering poor, or rest in our ceiled houses
   and yield no shelter to the homeless wanderer. Brethren, if nature
   herself teaches you wherefore should I say more, ye are not unnatural,
   ye achieve already more than mere nature can demand; you do the
   greater, you will not fail in the less.

   2. Further, we may remark that the absence of sympathy has always been
   esteemed, in all countries, and in all ayes, one of the most abominable
   of vices. In old classic history who are the men held up to everlasting
   execration? Are they not those who had no mercy on the poor. Each land
   has its legend of the proud noble who hoarded up his corn in the day of
   famine, and bade the perishing multitudes curse and die; and down to
   this day the name of such a wretch is quoted as a word of infamy. A man
   without a heart would be a beast more worthy of being hunted down than
   a tiger or a wolf. Men with little hearts and grasping ungenerous
   spirits, how heartily are they despised! If they wear the Christian
   garb they disgrace it; the ordinary disciples of morality are ashamed
   of them, and I may add that even vice and immorality shun their
   company. The grinding, hardhearted man may gain the approbation of
   those who are like himself, and therefore applaud him for his prudence
   and discretion, but the big heart of the world has ever been sound
   enough on this matter to understand that there is no genuine virtue
   without liberality, and that one of the most damning of all vices which
   stamps a man as being thoroughly rotten at the core, is that vice of
   selfishness which makes the wretch live and care only for his own
   personal aggrandizement, and offer only a stony heart to the woes of
   his fellows. Brethren, I entertain no fear that you will ever win the
   badge of infamy which hangs about the neck of churls.

   3. But I have better arguments to use with you. Sympathy is especially
   a Christian's duty. Consider what the Christian is, and you will say
   that if every other man were selfish he should be disinterested; if
   there were nowhere else a heart that had sympathy for the needy there
   should be one found in every Christian breast. The Christian is a king;
   it becometh not a king to be meanly caring for himself. Was Alexander
   ever more royal than when his troops were suffering from thirst, and a
   soldier offered him a bowl full of the precious liquid, he put it
   aside, and said it was not fitting for a king to drink while his
   subjects were thirsty, and that he would share the sorrow with them? O
   ye; whom God has made kings and princes, reign royally over your own
   selfishness, and act with the honorable liberality which becomes the
   seed royal of the universe. You are sent into the world to be saviours
   of others, but how shall you be so if you care only for yourselves? It
   is yours to be lights, and doth not a light consume itself while it
   scatters its rays into the thick darkness? Is it not your office and
   privilege to have it said of you as of your Master--"He saved others,
   himself he cannot save?" The Christian's sympathy should ever be of the
   widest character, because he serves a God of infinite love. When the
   precious stone of love is thrown by grace into the crystal pool of a
   renewed heart it stirs the transparent life floods into ever widening
   circles of sympathy: the first ring has no very wide circumference; we
   love our own household; for he that careth not for his own household is
   worse than a heathen man and a publican: but mark the next concentric
   ring; we love the household of faith. We know that we have passed from
   death unto life because we love the brethren:" look once more, for the
   ever-widening ring has reached the very limit of the lake, and included
   all men in its area, for "supplications, prayers, intercessions, and
   giving of thanks are to be made for all men."

   If any man shall think that we are not "born for the universe" and
   should narrow our souls, I can only say that I have not so learned
   Christ, and hope never to confine to a few the sympathy which I believe
   to be meant for mankind. To me, a follower of Jesus means a friend of
   man. A Christian is a philanthrophist by profession, and generous by
   force of grace; wide as the reign of sorrow is the stretch of his love,
   and where he cannot help he pities still.

   4. Beloved, will you remember the blessed example of our Lord and
   Savior Jesus Christ; for this, surely, will teach you not to live for
   self. "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he
   was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor, that we through his poverty
   might be rich." His heart is made of tenderness, his bowels melt with
   love. In all our afflictions he is afflicted. Since the day when he
   became flesh of our flesh, he hath never hidden himself from our
   sufferings. Our glorious Head is moved with all the sorrows which
   distress the members. Crowned though he now be, he forgets not the
   thorns which once he wore, amid the splendors of his regal state in
   Paradise he is not unmindful of his children here below. Still is he
   persecuted when Saul persecutes the saints, still are his brethren as
   the apple of his eye, and very near his heart. If ye can find in Christ
   a grain of selfishness, consecrate yourselves unto your lusts, and let
   Mammon be your God. If ye can find in Christ a solitary atom of
   hardness of heart and callousness of spirit, then justify yourselves,
   ye viscose hearts are as stones to the wailing of the desolate. But if
   ye profess to be followers of the Man of Nazareth, be ye full of
   compassion; he feeds the hungry lest they faint by the way; he bindeth
   up the broken in heart and healeth all their wounds; he heareth the cry
   of the needy and precious shall their blood be his sight; therefore be
   ye also tenderhearted also very affectionate the one toward the other.

   5. Dear friends, though this last reason will certainly be to a
   Christian heart the very best that can be urged, yet permit me to
   suggest another. Sympathy is essential to our usefulness. I know that a
   man in the ministry who cannot feel had much better resign his office.
   We have heard some hold forth the doctrines of grace, as if they were a
   nauseous medicine, and men were to be forced to drink thereof by hard
   words and violent abuse. We have always thought that such men did more
   hurt than good, for while seeking to vindicate the letter, they
   evidently missed the spirit of the faith once delivered unto the
   saints. Cold and impassive are some of our divines; they utter truth as
   though it were no concern of theirs whether men received it or no. To
   such men heaven and hell, death and eternity, are mere themes for
   oratory, but not subjects for emotion. The man who will do good must
   throw himself into his words; and put his whole being into intense
   communion which the truth which he utters. God's true minister cannot
   preach a sermon upon the ruin of man without feeling a deep amazement
   in his own spirit, because of the burden of the Lord. He cannot, on the
   other hand, unfold the joys of pardon and the love of Jesus without a
   leaping heart and rejoicing tongue. The man who is devoid of love will
   be devoid of power, for sympathies are golden chains by which Christian
   orators draw men's ears and hearts to themselves and the truths they
   teach. "I preached," said one, "when spake of condemnation as though I
   wore the chains about my own arm, and heard them clanking in my ears."
   "And I," another might have said, "I preached of pardon bought with
   blood, as though I had myself just come up from the sacred fountain,
   having left my foulness all behind, and being girt about with the white
   linen which is the righteousness of the saints." If our hearers
   perceive that we do not really long for their good, that our preaching
   is but a matter of mere routine to be got through as so much irksome
   "duty," can we hope to win their hearts? But when they feel that there
   is a roving hears within the preacher, then they give the more earnest
   heed to the things whereof we spells. You Sunday-school teachers, you
   must have warm hearts or you will be of little use to your children.
   You street-preachers, City missionaries, Bible women, and tract
   distributors, you who in any way seek to serve our Lord--a heart, a
   heart, a heart, a tender heart, a flaming heart, a heart saturated with
   intense sympathy, this, when sanctified by the Holy Spirit, will give
   you success in your endeavors. Name the men the wide world over who
   have been the most successful in bending multitudes to their own will,
   and they are the men who have the largest hearts. For good or evil,
   heart-power is real power. The men whose hearts move with mighty
   pulsations like the piston-rod of a steam engine, will soon move the
   wheels and drag along the ponderous load. We must have within us the
   engine of the heart, throbbing mightily and continually, and then shall
   we draw the hearts of men with irresistible force.

   6. Here I must supplement that thought with another; sympathy may often
   be the direct means of conversion. How do the Romanists craftily avail
   themselves of this! The loaves and fishes have always been used at Rome
   as an attraction to the multitude. Still the Sister of Mercy, with her
   basket on her arm, goes to the poor, or devotes herself to the
   sick--and in this we praise them; were it the gospel they had to teach,
   they could scarcely have found a wiser method for its propagation; and
   be it what it may which they have to disseminate, they certainly have
   not failed for lack of wisdom. I would that we who have a purer faith,
   could remember a little more the intimate connection between the body
   and the soul. Go to the poor man and tell him of the bread of heaven,
   but first give him the bread of earth, for how shall he hear you with a
   starving body? Talk to him of the robe of Jesu's righteousness, but you
   will do it all the better when you have provided a garment with which
   he may cover his nakedness. It seems an idle tale to a poor man if you
   talk to him of spiritual things and cruelly refuse him help as to
   temporals. Sympathy, thus expressed, may be a mighty instrument for
   good; and even without this, if you be too poor to be able to carry out
   the pecuniary part of benevolence, a kind word, a look, a sentence or
   two of sympathy in trouble, a little loving advice, or an exhortation
   to your neighbor to cast his burden on the Lord, may do much spiritual
   service. I do not know, but I think if all our Church-members were full
   of love, and would always deal kindly, there would be very few hearts
   that would long hold out, at least from hearing the Word. You ask a
   person to hear your preacher; but he knows that you are crotchety,
   short-tempered, illiberal, and he is not likely to think much of the
   Word which, as he thinks, has made you what you are; but if, on the
   other hand, he sees your compassionate spirit, he will first be
   attracted to you, then next to what you have to say, and then you may
   lead him as with a thread, and bring him to listen to the truth as it
   is in Jesus, and who can tell but thus, through the sympathy of your
   tender heart, you may be the means of bringing him to Christ.

   7. And I shall say here, that this sympathy is sure to be a great
   blessing to yourselves. If you want joy--joy that you may think upon at
   nights, and live upon day after day, next to the joy of the Lord, which
   is our strength, is the joy of doing good. The selfish man thinks that
   he has the most enjoyment in laying out his wealth upon himself. Poor
   fool! his interest is vastly small compared with the immense return
   which generosity, and liberality, and sympathy bring to the man who
   exercises them. Be ye assured that we can know as much joy in another's
   joy as in our own joy. Then, beside the joy it brings, there is
   experience. Experimental knowledge may be gained by it. I would not, of
   course, aver that a man can get experience without having trouble
   himself, but the next best thing to it, is to bear other people's
   troubles. We may never have known what it is to want bread, but to see
   a saint who has been brought to the door of starvation, and yet has had
   his bread given and his water sure, may be almost as useful. You and I
   may not be tortured with the pangs of sickness or the weakness of
   decay, but to climb some three pairs of stairs to a miserable back
   room, and to see a child of God patient in his tribulation, and to put
   ourselves by sympathy upon his bed, and suffer and smart with him, may
   give us the next best thing to the experience itself. I do think,
   brethren, that some men may live twenty lives, and get the experience
   of twenty men, and the information and real good of twenty men's
   troubles, by having large hearts which can hold the sorrows of others.
   Oh! we cannot tell how much blessedness we might receive if we were
   more free to aid our fellows. "It is more blessed to give than to
   receive." Ask any man who has been to visit the sick, the poor, and the
   needy, whether he has not come home more resigned to his own trials,
   and more satisfied with his own lot. We gave a shilling, and received a
   casket of pearls, which dropped from the lips of the poor suffering-one
   while he told of God's faithfulness, and the preciousness of the love
   of Christ. We are great losers when we know not these rich poor saints.
   If we would but trade with them 'twere a blessed barter for us. Coral
   and pearl--let no mention be made of them in comparison with the
   priceless gems which we might receive if we had greater sympathy and
   fuller communion with the suffering sons and daughters of Jerusalem.

   Thus have I said as much as may be fitting this morning in commendation
   of Christian sympathy.

   II. We speak now of THE HINDRANCES TO CHRISTIAN SYMPATHY.

   Some say that there is very little Christian sympathy abroad. I do not
   believe them, except as regards themselves. I dare say they have
   measured other men's corn with their own bushels. When any say, "O,
   there is no love in the Church," I have always noticed that, without
   exception, they have no love themselves. On the other hand, we have
   heard others say, "What a blessed unity there is in the Church; when we
   come to the Tabernacle it does us good to get such hearty shakes of the
   hand, and to see such love in every brother's eye." When they speak
   thus, I know the reason is that they carry fire in their own hearts,
   and then they think the Church warm, while the others carry lumps of
   ice in their hearts, and then they imagine that everybody must be cold.

   1. One of the great impediments to Christian sympathy is our own
   intense selfishness. We are all selfish by nature, and it is a work of
   grace to break this thoroughly down, until we live to Christ, and not
   to self any longer. How often is the rich man tempted to think that his
   riches are his own. A certain lady being accosted by a beggar, who
   asked charity of her; she gave him a shilling, saying, "Take that
   shilling; it is more than God ever gave me." The beggar said, "O,
   Madam, but God has given you all your abundance." "Nay," said she, "but
   I am right; God has only lent me what I have; all I have is a loan." I
   would that all who are entrusted with this world's substance felt that
   it was only loaned out to them, and that they were stewards. Now, a
   steward, when he has orders to give a poor man a large sum of money,
   does not say, "Dear me, that will make me poor!" He never considered
   that which was entrusted to him belonged to him, and so he gives it
   freely enough. So, remember, you have nothing of your own; specially
   you Christian men, who have been bought with a price, you are in a
   double sense stewards unto God, and should act as such; living to God,
   we should devote ourselves to the good of the race for Jesus' sake.

   2. Another hindrance lies in the customs of our country. We still have
   amongst us too much of caste and custom. The exclusiveness of rank is
   not readily overcome. It is not so, I thank God, in this place of
   worship, but I have known many places of worship where there are tiers
   of Christian people, layer on layer, who never associate with each
   other. In some places of worship they put up in conspicuous letters,
   "FREE SEATS FOR THE POOR." I do abominate that! Then you have another
   class--respectable tradesmen, but though they sit at the some table
   with the dons, and my lord this or that, they never think for a moment
   of speaking to them. When people come out of Church, what a gradation
   there is! Have I not seen in many a country village how, first of all,
   the squire goes out, and then the bailiff follows, and then all the
   poor people curtsey and bow to show their abject servitude and serfdom.
   And all this in a Christian land! In our Dissenting places of worship
   what stiffness there is; what rustling of the silks up one aisle, and
   what quietude of the cottons in another! When the members come together
   Lady So-and-so, who sits yonder, or Miss This, who sits there, will
   hardly recognize Nancy That, or Betsy So-and-so? Now I feel as much
   pleased in associating with the poorest of God's saints as with those
   who are of a higher degree in this world, for I believe the happy
   fusion of all will promote the interests of all. It would vex my heart
   to see you grow into the stuck-up respectability of some of our fine
   congregations. Away for ever with these castes and divisions; let us
   maintain the family feeling, and suffer nothing to violate it.

   3. Much want of sympathy is produced by our ignorance of one another.
   We do not know the sufferings of our fellows. If I had brought the
   newspaper here to-day, and I had half a mind to do so, and had read you
   some extracts about the sufferings in Preston, and Wigan, and the
   various towns in Lancashire, you would have known much more about the
   distress than you do now. Or if, which would do as well, you were to go
   next Monday with some City missionary to the least East end, or St.
   Giles's, or some poor district this side the water you would say, "Dear
   me, I did not know that people really did suffer at this rate; I had no
   idea of it or I would have given more to the poor." We want to be
   educated into the knowlege of our national poverty; we want to be
   taught and trained, to know more of what our fellow-men can and do
   suffer. Oh! if the Christian Church knew the immorality of London, she
   would cry aloud to God. If but for one night you could see the harlotry
   and infamy, if you could but once see the rascality of London gathered
   into one mass, your hearts would melt with woe and bitterness, and you
   would bow yourselves before God and cry unto him for this city as one
   that mourneth for his only son, even for his firstborn.

   4. No doubt the abounding deception which exists among those who seek
   our help has checked much liberality. I think I can tell the moment a
   man opens his mouth to address me, when a man wants to beg of me. There
   is such a particular whine and a sanctified unction, that the moment
   you hear it, you think, "I will give that man nothing; he is an old
   established beggar, and gets his living by it." Seeing, as I have done,
   not scores, but hundreds of these beings, there is a tendency to get
   one's heart hard and callous, and to say "Oh! they are all deceivers."
   But they are not all such; there is a vast amount of real distress of a
   private character, a suffering which will not cry nor moan; and I take
   it that it ought to be your business and mine to seek out these cases;
   not to stop till they come to us, but to go to them, avoiding ever,
   with a stern discretion, those ill cases which do but prey upon
   Christian charity, but seeking out the genuine sufferers, and giving
   them relief. Let none of these things, great obstacles though they be,
   hinder your sympathy to-day, for none of them exist in the case which
   we shall have to plead this morning.

   III. A few minutes upon THE FRUITS OF CHRISTIAN SYMPATHY.

   1. The fruit of Christian sympathy will be seen in a kindly association
   with all Christians: we shall not shun them nor pass them by.

   2. It will be seen next, in a kindly encouragement of those who want
   aid, constantly being ready to give a word of good advice, and good
   cheer to the heart which is ready to faint. Dear Christian friends, I
   think our experience is not so available as it might be for the good of
   others. In the olden times they that feared the Lord spoke often one to
   another, and the Lord hearkened and heard. You will find your brethren
   often distressed in mind; you have passed through the same stage;
   conversation with them will help them to escape as you have done. More
   especially is this conversation very valuable under the pangs of
   conviction. When a young man or woman has been awakened under the
   ministry, I charge you each before God, you that have found peace in
   Christ, to watch the throes and agonies of the new birth, and be at
   hand to take the little child and nurse it for Christ. The senior
   members of every Christian Church should consider themselves, as called
   by their very position to look after the young. We have some such here;
   we want a few more. We want you mothers in Israel, especially, to be so
   sympathetic that you may no sooner hear that a soul is in distress than
   you are in distress too till you can have poured in the oil and the
   wine into their wounds. I think this sympathy should be especially
   shown to any that backslide. There is a tendency to cut such off from
   the Church-book and then leave them. This should not be; we must look
   after that which is out of the way. The shepherd must leave the ninety
   and nine sheep to go after the one which has gone astray. If you see
   one vacillating be most careful there. If you detect in any a growing
   coldness, be the more anxious to foster that which remains, which is
   ready to die. Let a holy discipline and watchfulness be maintained over
   the entire Church, by the care and forethought of every one for his
   next friend. Thus can you practically allow your Christian sympathy.

   3. Show it, also, whenever you hear the good name of any called into
   doubt. Stand up for your brethren. 'Tis an ill bird that fouls its own
   nest, but there are some such birds. The moment they hear a word or a
   whisper against a Christian man, though a member of the same Church,
   "Report it, report it" say they; always pretending that they are very
   sorry, but all the while sucking it as a dainty morsel. The old
   proverb, you know, was, "We have done dinner; clear the things away,
   and now let us sit down and crack other men's characters." I fear me
   there are even some professing Christians who do that. This is not
   sympathy but the malice of Satan: may God deliver you from it! Stand up
   for all that are your fellow-soldiers: be jealous of the honor of the
   regiment in which you have enlisted.

   4. But still there is no Christian sympathy in all this if it does not
   when needed, prove itself by real gifts of our substance. Zealous words
   will not warm the cold; delicate words will not feed the hungry; the
   freest speech will not set free the captive, or visit him in prison;
   the most adorned words will not clothe the naked, and the words that
   are most full of unction will not pour oil and wine into the wounds of
   the sick. Words! Words! Words! Chaff! Chaff!! Chaff!!! If there be no
   act there is no sympathy. "Whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his
   brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him,
   how dwelleth the love of God in him?"

   Perhaps some of my hearers this morning will say that the text and the
   subject are appropriate to the occasion, but that they want some
   spiritual food. Well, you get that often, I trust, here; but I am
   persuaded that there are times when, if Christ were upon earth, he
   would dwell mainly upon these themes of practical Christianity. I read
   my Master's Sermon on the Mount, and what doctrine is there in it? It
   is all precept from beginning to end; and so shall my sermon be this
   morning; not doctrine, but precept; for this I know, we want to see in
   the Christian world more of the practical carrying out of the loving
   benevolence of the Savior. What care I about the doctrines for which
   you fight, unless they produce in you the spirit of Christ? What care I
   for your forms of faith and your ceremonies, if all the while you are a
   Nabal, wickedly saying in your heart, "Shall I take my bread and my
   water to give it unto these strangers?" Oh! let your faith be a living
   faith, lest, while you have the form of godliness, you deny the power
   thereof. Time was when, wherever a man met a Christian he met a helper.
   "I shall starve!" said he, until he saw a Christian's face, and then he
   said, "Now shall I be aided." But some have thrown benevolence aside,
   and imagine that these are old duties of a legal character. Legal,
   then, will I be, when, in my Master's name, again I say, "To do good
   and to communicate forget not, for with such sacrifices God is well
   pleased."

   IV. I now conclude with an appeal for the special object of the
   collection this morning. I ASK YOUR AID FOR THESE NEEDY ONES IN
   LANCASHIRE.

   1. Remember, first, that their poverty is no fault of their own. They
   are not brought to it by excess of meats or drinks. They are not
   reduced to it by riot or disorder. It is not idleness; it is not a
   wilful strike against the masters. It is utterly unavoidable; and here,
   therefore, is the right place for benevolence to display itself. The
   Egyptian hieroglyph for charity is very suggestive. It is a naked child
   giving honey to a bee which has lost its wings. Notice, it is a child:
   we should give in meekness. It is a naked child: we should give from
   pure motives, and not for show. It is a child feeding a bee; not a
   drone, but one that will work; a bee that has lost its wings; one,
   therefore, which has lost its power to supply itself: a picture before
   you of those martyrs and confessors of industry whose cause I plead
   to-day. A bee that has lost its wings makes its appeal for a little
   honey to every childlike heart here today, and they who are true to God
   will not refuse it their aid.

   2. Remember, too, that the cause of this suffering is a national
   sin--the sin of slavery. We have not yet passed the third generation,
   and upon a nation God visits sin to the third and fourth generation. We
   have rid ourselves, at last, of this accursed stain so far as our
   present Government is concerned, we are therefore delivered from any
   fear in future on that groun; but still, if slavery be now in America,
   we must remember that it would not have been there if it had not been
   carried there, and we are partners in guilt. Moreover, there has been
   too much winking at slavery amongst the merchants of Manchester and
   Liverpool. There has not been that abhorrence of the evil which should
   have been, and therefore it is just in the Providence of God that when
   America is cut with the sword we should be made to smart with the rod.
   If the Lord is pleased to smite our nation in one particular place, yet
   we must remember that it is meant for us all. Let us all bear the
   infliction as our tribulation, and let us cheerfully take up the
   burden, for it is but a little one compared with what our sins might
   have brought upon us. Better far for us to have famine than war. From
   all civil war and all the desperate wickedness which it involves, good
   Lord deliver us; and if thou smitest us as thou hast done, it is better
   to fall into the hand of God than into the hand of man.

   3. I must also refresh your memories, though you know it well, with the
   fact of the patient endurance of those who have been called to suffer.
   You have read of no burning of mills, no breaking open of baker's
   shops. You have heard no accusations brought against the aristocracy;
   you have heard of no great political movement for the upsetting of our
   institutions. There was never upon earth a nobler spectacle than that
   of these men suffering so Frightfully with their wives and children,
   and yet enduring it so patiently. They deserve to be helped. If ever
   there was a case in which human ears must be opened to hear the cry of
   woe, this is it. If you and I had our wives and children at home
   starving, and had nothing but the charity of the parish and the little
   relief of the committees, making only some one-and-fourpence or
   one-and-sixpence a head to live upon for a week, I am afraid we should
   begin to think that we could re-adjust the machinery of Government; or
   it might happen that if we saw bread and could not get it we might
   break the window, or do some unrighteous act to take away another man's
   property sooner than see our children starve. They suffer well; they
   suffer well, brethren; and we do not well unless we help them.

   4. Moreover, remember how widely spread is this distress. I know too
   many of my dear hearers are often brought to as great poverty as the
   operatives in Lancashire, but then you have some little help; sometimes
   the Church can give it; at other times some friend, not quite so badly
   off as you are, will help you. But there, if a poor man wants a loaf,
   he cannot get it of the tradesman even on credit, for the tradesman has
   no power to give him credit. Nor can these people borrow of their
   neighbors, for where all are equally destitute one cannot help another.
   Even the Churches fail to do what they would wish to do. In the case of
   one dear brother, late a student in our college, to whom we constantly
   send supplies week by week, and who maintains a class of some forty
   young women, and in answer to the cry of faith has found all the means,
   I hope to aid him by this collection of to-day. The distress is not
   only with the poor now, but with those a little above them, and God
   only knoweth to what extent it must go unless in his gracious
   Providence he by some means or other, bringeth a supply of cotton that
   they may once again be at work.

   5. Wherefore need I urge you, my hearers? I feel that you are ready now
   to assist these suffering ones. Let your own gratitude to God move you.
   Blessed be God that you have not this famine and straitness of bread.
   Thank the Master that though times may be hard, and some may now and
   then complain, yet we have not to walk through our streets and see our
   factories shut up, and miss the smoke which marks the daily toil that
   brings food to hungry mouths. We have not to know every habitation is a
   Bochim because the strong man boweth down for lack of bread, and the
   faces of the children are wan, and the mothers weep, and even the
   breasts refuse the infant child its needed nourishment. Give as God has
   prospered you. He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord, and the
   Lord shall remember him in the time of trouble. He that believeth on
   the Lord Jesus Christ hath everlasting life freely given him; let him,
   therefore, freely give, even as he hath Freely received.

   cause of the famine was, curiously enough, the American Civil War.
   Cotton shipments from the American South had been blockaded by Union
   forces, thus effectively putting the cotton mills in Lancashire out of
   business. The results were far-reaching and disastrous for the cotton
   manufacturing district of England.

                          A Message from God for Thee

   A Sermon

   (No. 480)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, November 16th, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion;
   he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine
   iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins."--Lamentations
   4:22.

   EVERY SABBATH we are insisting upon it that both the Law and the Gospel
   have a voice to universal manhood: the Law in its condemnation of every
   subject under its sway, and the Gospel in its gracious invitation and
   command to every creature under heaven. Yet, at the same time, we must
   never forget that both the Law and the Gospel have a special voice to
   certain characters, that the law has ten-fold thunders for peculiar
   sinners, and, on the other hand, that the Gospel has a voice of
   unutterable sweetness to those favored persons who have by the Holy
   Spirit been prepared to hear its voice. While there are texts which are
   universal, and invitations whose range is as wide as fallen humanity,
   there are at the same time a still larger number of texts which are
   aimed like arrows at an appointed target. My text this morning can
   never be understood unless we clearly point out the characters to whom
   it is addressed. The blessing is not for the daughter of Edom, neither
   is the curse for the daughter of Zion. We must be very earnest with our
   own hearts this morning, to discover, if possible, whether we come
   under the number of those whose warfare is accomplished, and whose sin
   is pardoned; or whether, on the other hand, we abide with the multitude
   on whom resteth the curse of God, and whose sins shall be discovered
   and punished by the right-hand of the Most High. I have a double
   message from the Lord this morning. I say not alone, as did the blind
   prophet of old, "Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; for I am sent to thee
   with heavy tidings;" but I have also to say, "Come in thou blessed of
   the Lord, wherefore standest thou without." According to the persons I
   address, my message will be as pleasant as ever was brought by those
   whose feet were beautiful upon the mountains because they published
   good tidings of great joy, or as dreadful as that which Daniel bore to
   the trembling monarch in the day when his kingdom was divided and given
   to the Medes and Persians.

   Our two messages we will try to deliver in their order; we shall then
   want your attention and patience for a minute while we answer the
   question--Why the difference? and then we will press upon each
   character the force of the message, that each may be led to believe
   what is addressed to him.

   I. Our FIRST MESSAGE IS ONE OF COMFORT. "The punishment of thine
   iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry
   thee away into captivity."

   1. We find, at the outset, a joyous fact. Read it with glistening eyes
   ye to whom it belongs--"The punishment of thine iniquity is
   accomplished, O daughter of Zion." In the case of the kingdom of Judah,
   the people had suffered so much in their captivity that their God, who
   in his anger had put them from him, felt his repentings kindle
   together, and considered that they had suffered enough; "For she hath
   received at the Lord's hand," said the prophet, "double for all her
   sin." Brethren, in our case we have not been punished at all, but yet
   the words may stand as they are, and be literally true, for the
   punishment of our iniquity is accomplished. Remember that Sin must be
   punished. Any theology which offers the pardon of sin without a
   punishment, ignores the major part of the character of God. God is
   love, but God is also just--as severely just as if he had no love, and
   yet as intensely loving as if he had no justice. To gain a just view of
   the character of God you must perceive all his attributes as infinitely
   developed; justice must have its infinity acknowledged as much as
   mercy. Sin must be punished. This is the voice which thunders from the
   midst of the smoke and the fire of Sinai--"The soul that sinneth it
   shall die;" "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things
   which are written in the book of the law to do them." "Sin must be
   punished" is written on the base of the eternal throne in letters of
   fire; and, as the damned in hell behold it, their hopes are burned to
   ashes. Sin must be punished, or God must cease to be. The testimony of
   the Gospel is not that the punishment has been mitigated or foregone,
   or that justice has had a sop given it to close its mouth. The
   consolation is far more sure and effectual; say ye unto the daughter of
   Zion that "the punishment of her iniquity is accomplished." Christ hath
   for his people borne all the punishment which they deserved; and now
   every soul for whom Christ died may read with exultation--"The
   punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished." God is satisfied, and
   asks no more.

   Sin deserved God's wrath; that wrath has spent itself on Christ. The
   black and gathering clouds had all been summoned to the tempest, and
   manhood stood beneath the dark canopy waiting till the clouds of
   vengeance should empty out their floods. "Stand thou aside!" said
   Jesus--"Stand thou aside, my spouse, my Church, and I will suffer in
   thy stead." Down dashed the drops of fire; the burning sleet swept
   terribly over his head, and beat upon his poor defenceless person,
   until the clouds had emptied out their awful burden, and not a drop was
   left. Beloved, it was not that the cloud swept by the wind into another
   region where it tarries until it be again called forth, but it was
   annihilated, it spent itself entirely upon Christ. There is no more
   punishment for the believer since Christ hath died for him. In his
   dying, our Lord has satisfied the divine vengeance even to the full.
   Then this, too, must satisfy our conscience. The enlightened conscience
   of a man is almost as inexorable as the justice of God, for an awakened
   conscience, if you give it a false hope, will not rest upon it, but
   crieth out for something more. Like the horse-leech it saith--"Give,
   give, give." Until you can offer to God a full satisfaction, you cannot
   give the conscience a quietus. But now, O daughter of Zion, let thy
   conscience be at rest. Justice is satisfied; the law is not despised:
   it is honored; it is established. God can now be just, severely so, and
   yet, seeing that thy punishment is accomplished, thou mayest come with
   boldness unto him, for no guilt doth lie on thee. Thou art accepted in
   the Beloved; thy guilt was laid on him of old, and thou art now safe."

   In thy Surety thou art free,

   His dear hands were pierced for thee;

   With his spotless vesture on,

   Holy as the Holy One."

   Come thou boldly unto God, and rejoice thou in him.

   Lest, however, while God is reconciled and conscience is quieted, our
   fears should even for an instant arise, let us repair to Gethsemane and
   Calvary, and see there this great sight, how the punishment of our
   iniquity is accomplished. There is the God of heaven and of earth
   wrapped in human form. In the midst of those olives yonder I see hmt in
   an agony of prayer. He sweats, not as one who labors for the bread of
   earth, but as one who toils for heaven. He sweats "as it were great
   drops of blood falling down to the ground." It is not the sweat of his
   brow only, but "All his head, his hair, his garments, bloody be." God
   is smiting him, and laying upon him the punishments of our iniquities.
   He rises, with his heart exceeding sorrowful even unto death. They
   hurry him to Pilate's judgment-seat. The God of heaven and earth stands
   in human form to be blasphemed, and falsely accused before the tribunal
   of his recreant creature. He is taken by the soldiery to Gabbatha, they
   strip, they scourge him; clots of gore are on the whip as it is lifted
   from his back. They buffet him, and bruise him with their blows; as if
   his robe of blood were not enough, they throw about his shoulders an
   old cloak, and make him a mimic king. Little knew they that he was the
   King of kings. He gives his back to the smilers, and his cheeks to them
   that pluck off the hair, he hides not his face from shame and spitting.
   Oh! what shall be said of thee, thou Son of man? In what words shall we
   describe thy grief? All ye that pass by behold and see if there was
   ever any sorrow like unto his sorrow that was done unto him! Oh God,
   thou hast broken him with a rod of iron; all thy waves and thy billows
   have gone over him. He looks, and there is none to help; he turns his
   eye around, and there is none to comfort him. But see, through the
   streets of Jerusalem he is hastened to his death; they nail him to the
   transverse wood; they dash it into the ground; they dislocate his
   bones; he is poured out like water; all his bones are out of joint; he
   is brought into the dust of death; agonies are piled on agonies; as in
   the classic fable the giants piled Ossa upon Pelion that they might
   reach the stars, so now that man may reach to heaven, misery is piled
   on misery, what if I say hell on hell! but Jesus bears the dreadful
   load. At last he reaches the climax of anguish, grief could go no
   higher. "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!" was the sum total
   of all human misery; the gathering up of all the wrath of God, and all
   the sorrow of man into one sentence. And thus he dies! Say ye unto the
   daughter of Zion that her punishment is accomplished. "It is finished!"
   Let the angels sing it; hymn it in the plains of glory, tell it here on
   earth, and once again say ye unto the daughter of Zion that her warfare
   is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she hath received of the
   Lord's hand double for all her sins! This, then, is the joyous note we
   have to sound this morning.

   2. But--but--and here comes the solemn, soul-searching part of our
   discourse--Is the punishment of mine iniquity accomplished? Let us see
   to whom this message is sent. Will you open your Bibles at the book of
   Lamentations--it is but a slender volume--and follow me a moment with
   your eyes and with your hearts, for this promise is sent to a certain
   character, and I know there are some here who will read their own
   history therein.

   In the first chapter and at the sixth verse you find it said of
   her--"From the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed." We should
   have thought that Christ would have died for those who had some form
   and comeliness, but no. "God commendeth his love toward us, in that,
   while we were yet sinners, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." At
   the coming of the Holy Spirit into the soul, all self-righteousness
   melts away, our merit is dissolved like the rime of the morning frost
   before the heat of the rising sun. In the light of the Holy Spirit the
   darkness of the creature is removed, and the fancied goodness of fallen
   humanity dies like a dream. Now the man perceives himself to be utterly
   vile; that which once he esteemed as making him lovely in the sight of
   God has withered before his eyes, and all his glory is trailed in the
   mire. My hearer, has all thy self-righteousness been taken from thee?
   for rest assured thou art not this daughter of Zion unless thy beauty
   has all departed, and all thy boastful thoughts have been utterly
   slain.

   Wonder of wonders! the eighth and ninth verses tell us "Jerusalem hath
   grievously sinned," and the ninth verse tells us yet more, that "her
   filthiness is in her skirts." Thus, those for whom Christ died are made
   to feel their sin. While their righteousness becomes as filthy rags,
   their unrighteousness becomes loathsome and detestable in their sight.
   Holy Scripture rakes up the most terrible figures to set forth the
   abominable character of sin, some, even, which we would hardly dare to
   quote to meet the public ear, but which the renewed heart feels to be
   perfectly true. The heart discovereth itself to be all wounds, and
   bruises, and putrifying sores, till it abhorreth itself before God. "O
   Lord, I am vile." "We are all together as an unclean thing." "We are
   laden with iniquity." Such are the cries of awakened souls, and it is
   to such as these that the gracious message is directed.

   Look on, again, to the seventeenth verse, and there you find that this
   filthiness has brought her into utter distress--"Zion spreadeth forth
   her hands, and there is none to comfort her." So those to whom this
   message is sent are brought, through a sense of sin, into a comfortless
   state. Ceremonies, Baptism, the Lord's Supper--all these yield them no
   peace. They can no longer rest in their Church-goings and
   Chapel-goings. A formal, notional religion would once satisfy them, but
   they find no rest for the sole of their foot in such a presence now.
   Time was when if they went through a prayer at night and morning, and
   read a verse or two of the Bible, they thought all would be well; but
   now there is none to comfort them. These refuges of lies are all swept
   away, for the furious hail of conviction has laid them level with the
   ground. Let us be certain of this, that there is no word of peace or
   comfort for us in our text until the beauty in which we once boasted
   has all been withered before the wintry blasts of the law; till our
   filthiness has been discovered before our sight, and we have been led
   to an experimental acquaintance with our ruined and comfortless
   condition on account of our iniquities.

   To make the case worse, this poor daughter of Zion is obliged to
   confess that she deserved all her sufferings. In the eighteenth verse
   she says--"The Lord is righteous: for I have rebelled against his
   commandments." The soul feels now that God is just. Unrenewed persons
   find fault with God's justice. Eternal punishment they cavil at; hell
   is such a bugbear to them, that, just as every culprit will, of course,
   find fault with the prison and the gallows, so they rail at the wrath
   to come, though that wrath is just as sure, notwithstanding all their
   objections to it. But when the heart is really touched by divine grace,
   then it has no more to say for itself, but pleads guilty at the bar of
   God's great assize; and if the Judge should put on the black cap, and
   condemn it to be taken instantly to the place of execution, that soul
   could only say, "Thou art righteous, O Lord, for I have sinned." I
   despair of ever finding a word of comfort for any man or woman among
   you, if you have not been brought to feel that you deserve the wrath of
   God. Come with the ropes about your necks, ready for execution, and you
   will find a God ready to forgive.

   Further still: in the first verse of the second chapter you find that
   her prayer was not yet heard--"How hath the Lord covered the daughter
   of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the
   earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day
   of his anger!" Well do I remember the time in my own experience when I
   prayed in vain; when I bowed my knees and the heavens were as brass,
   and not a word or answer of comfort was given to my languishing spirit!
   All who are converted do not pass through this, for no one experience
   is a standard for all, but remember I am seeking out a certain class
   this morning, for my text is addressed to a special character. If thou
   hast been for months, ay, even for years, crying for mercy, and still
   hast not found it, let not this cast thee down, for to thee is this
   message sent this morning. Thou art this daughter of Zion covered with
   a cloud, and I have to say unto thee that "the punishment of thine
   iniquity is accomplished." Thy prayer has come up with acceptance, for
   the Spirit inspired it and Jesus offered it. God absolves thee, from
   heaven thy forgiveness comes. Oh, believe the word of the Lord, and
   rejoice therein. "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died,
   yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God,
   who also maketh intercession for us."

   Further: as her prayer was not heard, so every place of refuge was
   broken down. In the eighth verse of the second chapter you find--"The
   Lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath
   stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying,
   therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament: they languished
   together." Even what few stones of the ruined wall remained as an heap
   behind which the Israelitish warriors might defend themselves were to
   be broken down. So God goes on overturning, overturning, overturning in
   the sinner's heart till Christ comes in. After every hope has been
   broken down we are apt to build up another. "Peace, peace, where there
   is no peace," is the sinner's constant cry. Our Lord, who is determined
   to bring us to the obedience of faith, continually beats down the
   sinner's confidences, till at last there is not one stone left upon
   another that is not thrown down; then the sinner yields himself a
   captive, and free grace leads him in triumph to the cross. Is this your
   case this morning, my dear hearer? If it be then, my sweet message is
   for you. "Go in peace, they sins which are many are all forgiven thee!"

   Further still: this daughter of Jerusalem was now brought into a state
   of deep humiliation. Look at the tenth verse of the second chapter:
   "The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground and keep
   silence; they have cast up dust upon their heads: they have girded
   themselves in sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads
   to the ground." Here is a state of deep prostration of spirit! I do not
   want to enlarge on these points, because we have not time; and, what is
   more, there is no necessity for doing so, for you that have been
   brought through them understand them; and some of you who are in this
   state now will say, as I read the verses, "There is my picture; as face
   answereth to face in a glass so does the description of Jeremiah
   exactly answer to my condition." Well then, to you who lie in deep soul
   prostration, conscious that the lowest position is not too low for you,
   to you is this gracious message sent--"The punishment of thine iniquity
   is accomplished."

   Furthermore: it seems from the thirteenth verse that all her foes here
   let loose against her, and her grief exceeded all bounds and prevented
   all comparison:--"What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what
   thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I
   equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for
   thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?" So the sinner
   feels as if he stood all alone. That sorrowing young woman over yonder
   thinks that no one has ever suffered what she is now enduring. That
   trembling conscience there is writing this bitter thing against
   itself--"There was never such a sinner as I am, never one who had so
   hard a heart, and was so terribly broken on account of it!" Ye give a
   full vent to your sorrows, till your distress rolls like a torrent deep
   and wide. Yet it is not true that you are thus the only wayfarer in the
   path of repentance. Oh, but remember, that even though this were true,
   though all thine enemies, thine own heart, and all the devils in hell
   should conspire against thee, yet to thee, even to thee, thus saith the
   Lord, the God of hosts, "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people; speak ye
   comfortably unto Jerusalem, and say unto her that her warfare is
   accomplished."

   Not to keep you longer on this point let me take you on to another. In
   the eighteenth and nineteenth verses of the same chapter you will see
   that at last this afflicted daughter of Zion was brought to constant
   prayer:--"Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of
   Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no
   rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease. Arise, cry out in the
   night: in the beginning of the watches, pour out thine heart like water
   before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him," and so on.
   Thus the soul is brought to abide fast by the mercy-seat, and clings to
   the horns of the altar. At last the awakened spirit enters into a
   constant state of prayer, and its prayer is not so much an act as a
   condition. You know that hymn--that litany I was about to call it--

   "Wealth and honor I disclaim,

   Earthly comfortd, Lord, are vain,

   These can never satisfy,

   Give me Christ, or else I die."

   Every verse ends with that intense desire--"Give me Christ or else I
   die." This comes to be the state of a soul which God intends to bless;
   it falls into such a condition that it must have the blessing--"Give me
   Christ or else I die." "I can no denial take." Again, and again, and
   again, the sound of its moaning goeth up before the Lord God of
   Sabbaoth; its knocks at the gate of mercy are as frequent as the
   moments of the hour. Now, to you who are thus brought to pray because
   you cannot help it, who do not pray at set times merely, but whose very
   life has become one perpetual prayer for mercy--to you the Master
   speaks to-day. (Lord! open the ear that it may hear!) "The punishment
   of thine iniquity is accomplished."

   I have no time to go further into this case of the daughter of Zion. If
   you read the whole book of Lamentations through, it will well repay
   you. If you have ever passed through a state of conviction, if the law
   has ever had its perfect work in you, you will find that the
   Lamentations of Jeremiah will suit you, and when you get to the verse
   with which we commenced our reading this morning, you will read it with
   a holy unction resting on it--"It is of the Lord's mercy that we are
   not consumed, and because his compassions fail not." Now if you thus
   can read it, then remember there is no doubt at all about the fact that
   the precious word of this morning is for you; lay hold on it by faith;
   feed on it, live on it, and rejoice.

   3. I have not yet, however, told this message perfectly, for we must
   not overlook a third point. We have had a joyous fact, then a chosen
   person, and now there is a precious promise. "I will no more carry thee
   away into captivity." Thou art in captivity now, but it is the last
   thou shalt ever have. Thou art sorrowing on account of sin, and
   troubled even to despair; but thou art now forgiven--not thou shalt be,
   but thou art; all the wrath was laid on Christ; there is none remaining
   upon thee; thou art forgiven, and thy captivity is turned as the
   streams in the south. Let thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy
   tongue with singing, for the Lord hath done great things for thee.
   These convictions of thine shall never return again in their present
   terror; only do thou cling to the Rock of Ages, and no wave shall bear
   thee back into the deeps. Thou shalt go through the wilderness but
   once; thou shalt pass through the Jordan of a Savior's blood, and then
   thou shalt enter into Canaan and rest, for "we that have believed do
   enter into rest." And as to the future, in the world to come there is
   no captivity for thee. All thy hell is past; Tophet burns not for thee,
   neither can the pit shut its mouth upon thee. All that thou deservest
   of the wrath of God, Christ hath endured, and there is not a drop
   remaining for thee. Come thou to the golden chalice into which God
   drained his wrath, and look at the sparkling wine of love which filleth
   it. Ah, how changed from what it once was. 'Twas full, and foul, and
   black; each drop was Tophet, and the whole of it eternal misery. Christ
   drained it; to the very dregs he drained it; turning it upside down, he
   said, "It is finished!" and not a drop was left. Come thou, I say, to
   it, for it is not empty now; it is full again, but with what is it
   filled withal? 'Tis full to the brim and overflowing with love
   unsearchable, eternal, divine. Come thou and drink.

   "Calvary's summit let us trace,

   View the heights and depths of grace;

   Count the purple drops, and say,

   Thus my sins were borne away.

   Now no more his wrath we dread,

   Vengeance smote our Surety's head;

   Justice now demands no more,

   He hath paid the dreadful score.

   Sunk, as in a shoreless flood,

   Lost, as in the Saviours blood,

   Zion O! how bless'd art thou,

   Justified from all things now.

   "I will take the cup of salvation, and will call on the name of the
   Lord." You may have troubles, but you will never have punishment; you
   may know affliction, but you shall never know wrath; you may go to the
   grave, but you shall never go to hell; you shall descend into the
   regions of the dead, but never into the regions of the damned; the Evil
   One may bruise your heel, but he shall never break your head; you may
   be in prison under doubts, but you shall never be in prison under
   condemnation. "He will no more carry thee away into captivity." Thy
   punishment is all accomplished on another. Thou art free to-day; come
   thou forth out from the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage.
   Sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously, and brought out
   his people, and delivered them with his own right hand!

   Thus have I sought, as best I could, to deliver my first message; I
   hope many will be comforted thereby.

   II. We shall now turn to our second, which is, BURDEN OF WOE. Daughter
   of Edom! Thus saith the Lord unto thee--"I will visit thine iniquity."
   Unbeliever, thou who hast never felt thy need of Christ, and never fled
   to him, to thee he says, "I will visit thine iniquity." His justice
   tarries, but it is sure; his axe seems rusty, but it is sharp. The sins
   of the past are not buried; or if they be, they shall have a
   resurrection. Thy thoughts, thy words, thy deeds, shall all return in
   terror on thy head. Thou shalt begin, even in this life, to feel some
   of this punishment. On thy dying bed thy frail tenement shall creak,
   and thou shalt see the blazings of the furnace of fire through the
   rifts of thy crumbling cottage. When thou shalt lie a-dying, then shall
   the messengers of the Emperor of heaven stand about thy bed and summon
   thee to judgment. Thy cheek shall blanch, however brazen may now be thy
   brow. Then, strong man, thou shalt be bowed down, and thy loins shall
   be loosened, for when God dealeth with thee thou shalt feel his hand,
   even though thou wert girt about with bars of brass or triple steel.
   And then thou diest; thy death shall be the foretaste of the second
   death. Thy soul descends into the pit amongst thy kindred, and thou
   beginnest to feel what God can do against the men who laughed,
   despised, and defied him. Then shall thine oaths be all fulfilled then
   shall thy lustings and thy revellings come to thee in their true light.
   Then shalt thou hear ringing in thy conscience the echo of the divine
   sentence, "Thou deserves" all this, for God gave thee warning when he
   said "I will surely visit thee for thine iniquity." Then shall the
   trumpet ring--"Awake! Awake! ye dead and come to judgment!" From sea
   and land they start to live again. Thy soul comes back to its body
   which was its partner in guilt. I see you, and the multitudes like you,
   standing there while the great white throne is lifted up on high; the
   righteous have been gathered out from among the crowd and you remain;
   and, now, hark ye! hark ye! to a voice more dread than thunder--"Bind
   them up in bundles to burn them!--the drunkard with the drunkard; the
   swearer with the swearer: the careless, the proud, the self-righteous,
   each with each, and cast them into the furnace of fire." It is done,
   and where art thou now, sinner? Dost thou say of me this morning--"I
   knew that thou would speak not good but evil unto me?" Another day thou
   shalt bless thy stern reprover! Call me not thine enemy; it is thy sin
   that is thine enemy. I make not hell. I do but warn thee of it with a
   brother's love. Thou diggest hell thyself; thou thyself fillest it, and
   the breath of thy sins shall fan the fire. "The Lord of Hosts will
   visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom." Hear it; hearken thou to it,
   for it is the voice of God which now forewarns thee. Beware, O careless
   soul, beware of forgetting God, lest he tear thee in pieces, and there
   be none to deliver thee. I have heavy tidings indeed from the Lord to
   thee.

   But who is this daughter of Edom? As we searched for the daughter of
   Zion just now, so we must also search for the daughter of Edom. The
   verse preceding our text seems to give us some inkling of who she is.
   Of course it refers to the race of Esau, who inhabited such cities as
   Bozrah and Petra, which are now become a desolate wilderness. It seems,
   then, according to the twenty-first verse, that the daughter of Edom
   was a mirthful one. In irony and sarcasm the prophet says--"Rejoice and
   be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup
   shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make
   thyself naked." There is a holy joy which belongs unto the people of
   God; there is an unholy mirth which is a sure sign of a graceless
   state. You say from day to day, "How shall we amuse ourselves? What
   next gaiety; and what new levity? With what new liquor shall we fill
   the bowl of merriment? What shall we eat? What shall we drink?
   Wherewithal shall we be clothed? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we
   die." Pleasure is your life, your only thought. Ah! daughter of Edom,
   there is sackcloth for thy fine linen; there are ashes for all thine
   ornaments; thine earrings shall give place to everlasting tears-drops,
   and all thy beauty shall turn to rottenness and decay! Weep, all ye
   that thus make mirth in the presence of the avenging Judge, for the day
   cometh when he shall turn your laughter into mourning, and all your
   joys shall be ended! "Thus saith the Lord: say, a sword, a sword is
   sharpened, and also furbished: it is sharpened to make a sore
   slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should he then make
   mirth?"

   Edom, moreover dwelt very carelessly, she dwelt in the land of Uz, far
   from danger. Her dwelling was among the rocks. Petra, the stony city,
   was cut out of the live rock. The daughter of Edom said in her heart,
   "Who shall come hither to disturb the eagle's nest? The son of Esau
   dwelleth like an eagle in his eyrie, and he pounceth down upon his prey
   or ever his victim is aware? Who shall go up and bind the strong eagle,
   or pull forth his feathers from his mighty wings? Lo! he dareth to look
   in the face of the sun, and he laugheth at the spear of the hunter; who
   shall bring him down?" Thus saith the lord, "O daughter of Edom, I will
   visit thine iniquity." "Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and
   though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee
   down, saith the Lord." Ye proud men and women, ye say, "Will God deal
   with us? Will he treat us as common sinners? Even if he should, we will
   not care; fill high the bowl and let us drink, even though it be at
   Belshazzar's feast; we will drink, though there be damnation in the
   cup!" Thus speak ye, but thus saith the Lord, even as he said unto
   Moab--"I will bring down thy high looks. I will trample thee like straw
   is trodden for the dunghill, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord."

   More than this; it appears that this daughter of Edom rejoiced because
   of the sorrow of Zion, and made mirth and merriment over the sorrows of
   others. Do you not hear even the wise men say--"Ah! These drivelling
   hypocrites, whining about sin! Why, it is only a peccadillo, a mere
   trifle!" "Look," says one--"I am a man of the world. I know nothing of
   these women's fears and child-like tremblings: why do you sit and hear
   a man talk to you like this, and tell you of hell and of judgment--do
   you believe it? "No," says this man "I know nothing of your care; I
   despise the narrow spirits that believe in justice and in wrath to
   come!" O haughty boaster, as the Lord my God liveth, the day shall come
   when thou shalt be trodden as ashes under the soles of our feet. Beware
   ye, for when the Avenger cometh forth a great ransom shall not deliver
   you! I see the floods bursting forth on the earth. Noah, the preacher
   of righteousness, has been laughed at, and called an old hypocrite for
   talking of God's destroying nations. He is shut in yonder ark, and what
   think ye now of the prophet, what think ye now of the preacher of
   righteousness? Ye are swept away; the waves have covered you; a few of
   your strong ones climb to the tops of the hills, but the all-devouring
   waters reach you there. I hear your last shriek of awful anguish; there
   is not a single note of unbelief in it now; as you go down and the
   gurgling waters cover you, your last verdict is that the prophet was
   right and you were fools. To your death-beds I make my appeal. I appeal
   from your drunken lives to the sad sobriety of death. From all your
   gaiety, and carelessness, and contempt to day; I appeal to your last
   hours, and to your resurrection terrors! God help thee! God help thee
   to repent! but heavy, O daughter of Edom, heavy is thy curse; God will
   visit thine iniquity upon thee!

   It seems, too, from a passage in Malachi, first chapter and fourth
   verse, that Edom always retained a hope, a vain, a self-sufflcient
   confidence. "Whereas Edom saith, we are impoverished, but we will
   return and build the desolate places; thus saith the Lord of hosts,
   they shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, the
   border of wickedness, and, the people against whom the Lord hath
   indignation for ever." So there are some of you who say, "I dread not a
   loss of hope! Why, I have fifty refuges; I trust in this, and that, and
   the other, and when I do despair a moment yet I pluck up heart again."
   Ah! daughter of Edom, God will visit thee for thine iniquity, and thy
   vain confidences shall be as stubble to the flame.

   Besides, it seems that this daughter of Edom was very proud. Jeremiah
   describes her in the forty-ninth chapter and the sixteenth verse, in
   much the same language as Obadiah. But this tremendous pride was
   brought low at the last; and so also all those who think themselves
   righteous shall find themselves low at last. They rest and trust in the
   rotten and broken reed of their own doings, and woe shall be unto them,
   for God will visit them for their sins.

   I shall not enlarge further, except on that special word of warning
   with which the verse ends, "I will discover thy sins." Let every sinner
   here be afraid because of this! You have hidden your sin; He will
   discover it. It may be it was last night; 'twas in a very secret place,
   and you contrived so that none might track you; but the All-seeing One
   will discover your sin. "How are the things of Esau searched out! how
   are his hidden things sought up!" I may address some here who wear a
   very excellent moral character in the eyes of their neighbors, but if
   those neighbors did but know all, they would loathe them utterly. Your
   disguises are rent, your masks are plucked away; the Revealer of
   Secrets cometh forth. Dreadful shall be the day when, with sound of
   trumpet, every secret iniquity shall be published in the house-tops.
   The day cometh when, as Achan stood guilty before Joshua, so shall
   every man hear it said, "Be sure your sin will find you out." This is
   thy portion, daughter of Edom! Thy secret sins shall all be published
   in the light of the sun, for God will surely visit thee!

   III. The time expires, but I must just notice the next point--WHAT IS
   THE REASON WHY THERE ARE THESE DIFFERENT MESSAGES?

   The reason why I had to publish a message of mercy to the daughter of
   Zion just now was sovereign grace. The daughter of Zion had no right to
   pardon; she had done nothing to deserve it, but God had chosen her, and
   had entered into covenant with Abraham concerning her, that he would
   not leave nor forsake her. Everlasting love preserved deliverance for
   the beloved city. Our God had kindled in her heart thoughts of
   repentance, and in his sovereignity, because he will have mercy on whom
   he will have mercy, he sent her the gracious message of full remission
   by an accomplished punishment.

   But why was the second message sent to the daughter of Edom? Here it is
   not the line of sovereignity, but the line of justice; he sent it
   because the daughter of Edom deserved it. Sinner, when God says he will
   punish sin, thou mayest kick against it if thou wilt, but thy
   conscience tells thee thou deservest to be punished. God will not smite
   thee more than thou deservest, but let him only give thee as much, and
   wrath will come upon thee to the uttermost. Edom hath waxed proud; she
   hath been careless; she hath despised God; she is unbelieving; she
   repenteth not; therefore shall her iniquity be published, and God shall
   visit it upon her head.

   IV. And now, lastly, WHAT CLAIMS HAVE THESE MESSAGES TO OUR FAITH?
   Well, we believe this Bible to be the Word of God. I know we live in a
   day when even a bishop has ventured to impugn plenary inspiration. Do
   not attach too much importance to this new attack. It has no novelty in
   it; it is an old enemy, long since wounded to the heart, which now
   attempts a revival of its force. We have been alarmed at a man of
   straw, and a deal of noise has been made about nothing. The scullions
   of Zion's household are more glorious than this new hero of error, and
   are more than a match for him. We did think at first that there might
   be some force in his objections, but now we laugh them to scorn;
   ridicule is the only answer they deserve; let even the young children
   and the old women in the streets of Zion laugh at the new adversary! We
   believe still, and I hope that ever in this Christian land, and from
   this pulpit, I may always say that we believe this Book to be the Word
   of God. Well then, you to whom the first message is sent, believe it.
   You said, as I read the description just now, "That is my case." Very
   well, then, the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished. Do not
   say, "I will try and believe it," but believe it. Do not say, "I hope
   it is true;" it is true; believe it, and walk out of this house full of
   joy, saying in thy spirit, "My punishment was borne by Christ; I shall
   never be carried into captivity any more; being justified by faith, I
   have peace with God through Jesus Christ my Lord; I am accepted, I am
   forgiven." Praise him every day now that his anger has passed away for
   ever, and let the men of the world see how happy a Christian can be.
   "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry
   heart; for God now accepteth thy works. Let thy garments be always
   white; and let thy head lack no ointment." Does anybody object to that
   quotation? Object to Solomon and not to me; I intend, God helping me,
   to rejoice and be glad all my days.

   As for the second message, again I say this Book is God's Word, and it
   is true. Believe it. "Oh," says one, "but if I believed it, I should be
   full of awful anguish." Would to God you were; for do you not see that
   then you would come under the description of the daughter of Zion, and
   then the promise would be yours, for what is the law sent for? To dog
   men to hell? No, but to be our pedagogue to bring us to Christ. The
   schoolmasters in the old Greek times were such cruel fellows, that no
   boys would go to school voluntarily, so they had a pedagogue who with a
   stick, went round to the parents' houses and whipped the boys to
   school. Now we are so afraid to come to Christ, though he is a good and
   tender Master, that he employs the law to go round to our houses to
   whip us to himself, his peace, his great salvation. Ah! I would I could
   drive you to the Savior, for these thunders of to-day are meant to
   bring you from under the law that you may put your trust in Jesus
   Christ alone. Oh, daughter of Edom, careless and proud, thy doom is
   certain! The wrath of God is sure. Oh that thou wouldest but believe
   this, and that thy heart were broken, for then we might come to thee
   again, and say, "Thus saith the Lord, I have blotted out like a cloud
   thine iniquities, and like a thick cloud thy sins."

   May God bless the words of this morning, and unto his name be the glory
   for ever and ever. Amen.

                              A Drama in Five Acts

   A Sermon

   (No. 481)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, November 23rd, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both
   they that have wives be as though they had none; And they that weep, as
   though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced
   not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; And they that use
   this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth
   away."--1 Corinthians 7:29-31.

   HOLY SCRIPTURE SELDOM gives a special rule for each particular case,
   but it rather instructeth us by general principles applicable to all
   cases. To meet every distinct moral emergency which could possibly
   arise, and solve every separate problem of action, would require rather
   a library than a volume. To men who are taught of the Spirit of God,
   general principles are far more valuable than special precepts, and I
   am half persuaded that it is so with all persons; for it is less
   difficult to apply a general principle to a peculiar case than it is to
   find out exactly what the particular case may be, and what the special
   rule applicable to it. In writing to the Church at Corinth the apostle
   had to answer several questions with regard to marriage; whether, for
   instance, it was not better in those persecuting times, when men often
   had to flee suddenly from their houses, that they should remain
   unmarried; whether, again, supposing a person became a Christian after
   marriage, it was lawful for him to separate from the person with whom
   he was unequally yoked; and several other questions as to fitting
   action in certain extraordinary positions. To these the apostle answers
   with an "I suppose," or again, "Howbeit, for this speak I, not the
   Lord;" as if he felt himself quite out of his element in attempting to
   meet every case; but soon he lands on sure ground in the verses before
   us, and seems to say, "Whatever may be the answers which I ought to
   give to these special questions, of this one thing I am quite sure; I
   say positively and without any doubt that the time is short, and
   therefore it remaineth, whether ye are married or not, whether ye weep
   or whether ye rejoice, whether ye buy or whether ye sell, that ye
   should act in all these things as knowing, their temporary and
   unsubstantial character."

   Dear brethren, the important lesson which we endeavor to teach this
   morning is just this--that because time is so short, and the things of
   this world so frail and fleeting, it becomes us always to look at the
   things which are seen in their true character, and never to build
   substantial hopes on unsubstantial comforts, nor seek for solid joy
   from unreal things.

   In order that I may make this matter very plain, and may be the more
   likely to enlist your attention, and to secure the friendship of your
   memories in future years, I intend this morning to take you to a play.
   Strange thing for me to do, who have never crossed the threshold of a
   theater on any occasion, good or bad! Yet this morning I shall seat you
   in front of the stage, and I shall put the worldling side by side with
   you while the five acts are performed. I shall next invite you to
   attend in the character of a Christian, to look through the whole and
   discern its emptiness; then, in the third place, I shall point you to
   the curtain which is quite sure to drop upon the scene; and then we
   will walk out of this theater of unreal show, this fashion of this
   world which passeth away, and see what there is to do in this world
   which is real, practical, and lasting.

   Do not suppose that the idea of taking you to a theater this morning is
   original on my part; it is in my text. "The fashion of this world
   passeth away,"--the word translated "fashion" is borrowed from the
   changing scenes of the drama; where the splendid pageantry vanishes as
   the scene changes. Nor will you think Holy Scripture too severe in its
   comparison, when I remind you that one of the world's own poets has
   said

   "All the world's a stage,

   And all the men and women merely players."

   Nor will the most precise among you complain of the levity of a
   metaphor which is sanctioned by Apostolic use; but I trust you will all
   cheerfully listen, while in simple words I tell the story which the
   bard of the sanctuary has sung in flowing verse.

   "This life's a dream, an empty show;

   But the bright world to which I go,

   Hath joys substantial and sincere:

   When shall I wake and find me there?"

   I. WE WILL WITNESS "THE FASHION OF THIS WORLD" AS IT PASSES BEFORE US,
   LISTENING TO THE WORLDLING'S COMMENT.

   The first act introduces those that have wives. It opens with a
   wedding. The bride and bridegroom advance to the altar in bridal
   attire. The bells are ringing; crowds are cheering at the door, while
   overflowing mirth is supreme within. In another scene we observe
   domestic happiness and prosperity, a loving husband and a happy wife.
   Yet, further on in the performance, rosy children are climbing the
   father's knee; the little prattlers are lisping their mother's name.
   "Now," says our companion as he gazes with rapture, "This is real and
   enduring, I know it is; this will satisfy me; I crave for nothing more
   than this. Home is a word as sweet as heaven, and a healthy happy race
   of children is as fine a possession as even angels can desire. On this
   rock will I build all my hope; secure me this portion, and I cheerfully
   renounce the dreamy joys of religion." We whisper in his ear that all
   this is but a changing scene, and will by-and-bye pass away, for time
   is short, and wife and children are dying creatures. The man laughs at
   us, and says, "Fanatics and enthusiasts may seek eternal joys, but
   these are enough me." He believes that if there be anything permanent
   in the universe it is marrying and being given in marriage, educating
   and bringing up a family, and seeing them all comfortably settled. He
   is right in valuing the blessing, but wrong in making it his all. Will
   he see his error before the curtain falls? Or will he continue to found
   the hopes of an immortal spirit upon dying joys? See the green mounds
   in the cemetery, and the headstone, with "Here he lies." Alas for thee,
   poor deluded worldling, where is thy soul now? Doth it console thee
   that the dust of thine offspring shall mingle with thine ashes? Where
   hast thou now a home? What family hast thou now to care for? The first
   act is over; take breath and say, "This also is vanity."

   The tenour of the drama changes, alas, how soon! Household joys are
   linked with household sorrows. They that weep are now before us in the
   second act. The cloudy and dark days have come. There are parents
   wringing their hands; a beloved child has died, and they are following
   its corpse to the tomb. Anon, the merchant has suffered a tremendous
   loss; he puts his hand to his aching head and mourns, for he knows not
   what will be the end of his troubles. The wife is smitten by the hand
   of death; she lies on her bed, blanched with sickness and wan with
   pain; there is a weeping husband at her side, and then there is another
   funeral, and in the dim distance I see the black horses again and
   again. The woes of men are frequent, and sorrow's visits are not, like
   those of angels, few and far between. Our man of the world, who is much
   moved at this second act, foreseeing his own sorrows therein, weeps,
   until he fairly sobs out his feelings, clutches us with earnestness,
   and cries, "Surely this is awfully real; you cannot call this a
   fleeting sorrow or a light affliction. I will wring my hands for ever;
   the delight of my eyes has been taken from me; I have lost all my joys
   now; my beloved in whom I trusted has withered like a leaf in autumn
   before my face; now shall I despair; I shall never look up again!" "I
   have lost my fortune," says the afflicted merchant, "and distress
   overwhelms me; this world is indeed a wilderness to me; all its flowers
   are withered. I would not give a snap of my finger to live now, for
   everything worth living for is gone!" Sympathising deeply with our
   friend, we nevertheless venture to tell him that these trials to the
   Christian, because they are so short and produce such lasting good, are
   not killing sorrows. "Ah," says he, "you men of faith may talk in that
   way, but I cannot; I tell you these are real things." Like an English
   sailor, who, seeing a play, sprung upon the stage to help a lady in
   distress, believing that the whole was real, so do such men weep and
   sigh, as if they were to mourn for ever, because some earthly good has
   been removed. Oh that they knew that the depths of sorrow were never
   yet explored by a mortal mourner! Oh that they would escape from those
   lower deeps where immortal spirits weep and wail amidst an emphasis of
   misery! The sorrows of time are trifles indeed when compared with the
   pains of everlasting punishment; and on the other hand we reckon that
   they me not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
   revealed in us. They are but light afflictions, which are but for a
   moment, a mere pin's prick to the man of faith. Happy is the man whose
   eyes are opened to see that heirs of heaven sorrow not as those who are
   without hope. A real joy of heavenly origin is ever with believers, and
   it is but the shadow of sorrow which falls upon them. There let the
   curtain drop--let us enter into an eternal state, and what and where
   are these temporary griefs?

   But the third act comes on, and presents us with a view of those who
   rejoice. It may be that the first-born son has come of age, and there
   are great festivities. They are eating and drinking in the servants'
   hall, and in the master's banquet chamber; there are high notes of joy,
   and many compliments, and the smiling sire is as glad as man can be. Or
   it is the daughter's wedding, and kind friends implore a thousand
   blessings on her head, and the father smiles and shares the joy. Or it
   is a gain in business, a fortunate speculation; or the profits of
   industry have come flowing in, slowly perhaps, but still surely, and
   the man is full of rejoicing; he has a house, and home, and friends,
   and reputation, and honor, and he is, in the eyes of all who know him,
   happy; those who do not know him, think he has no cares, that he can
   have no sorrows, that his life must be one perpetual feast, and that,
   surely there can be no spot in his sun, no winter in his year, no ebb
   to follow his floods. Our friend by our side is smiling at this sunny
   picture. "There," says he, "is not that real? Why, there must be
   something in that! What more do you want? Only let me get the same, and
   I will leave you the joys of faith, and heaven, and immortality, to
   yourselves; these are the things for me; only let me laugh and make
   merry, and you may pray as you will. Fill high the bowl for me; put the
   roast and the viands on the table, and let me eat and drink, for
   to-morrow I die." If we gently hint to our friend that all this passes
   away like a vision of the night, and that we have learned to look on it
   as though it were not, he laughs us to scorn, and accounts us mad when
   he is most mad himself. As for ourselves, so far from resting upon the
   softest couch that earth can give us, we spurn its vain delights.

   "There's nothing round this spacious earth

   That suits my large desire;

   To boundless joy and solid mirth

   My nobler thoughts aspire.

   Where pleasure rolls its living flood,

   From sin and dross refined,

   Still springing from the throne of God,

   And fit to cheer the mind."

   But the fourth act of the drama is before us, and they that buy demand
   our attention. The merchant is neither a mourner nor a man of mirth; in
   the eyes of certain Mammonites he is attending to the one thing
   needful, the most substantial of all concerns. Here feast your eyes, ye
   hard, practical, earth-scrapers. There are his money-bags; hear how
   they thump on the table! There are the rolls of bonds, the banker's
   books, the title-deeds of estates, mortgages and securities, and the
   solid investment in his country's own console. He has made a good thing
   of life, and still he adheres business, as he should do; and, like a
   painstaking man, he is accumulating still and piling up his heap,
   meanwhile adding field to field and estate to estate, till soon he will
   possess a whole county. He has just now been buying a large and very
   fine house, where he intends to spend the remainder of his days, for he
   is about to retire from business; the layover is busy making out the
   transfer; the sum of money is waiting to be paid, and the whole thing
   is as good as settled. "Ah! now," says our friend, who is looking on at
   the play, "you are not going to tell me that this is all a shadow? It
   is not; there is something very solid and real here, at least,
   something that will perfectly satisfy me." We tell him we dare say
   there is something that will satisfy him, but our desires are of a
   larger span, and nothing but the infinite can fill them. Alas for the
   man who can find satisfaction in earthly things! It will be only for a
   time; for when he comes to lie upon his dying-bed, he will find his
   buyings and his sellings poor things wherewithal to stuff a dying
   pillow; he will find that his gainings and his acquisitions bring but
   little comfort to an aching heart, and no peace to a conscience
   exercised with the fear of the wrath to come. "Ah, ah!" he cries, and
   sneers sarcastically, putting us aside as only fit for Bedlam, "Let me
   trade and make a fortune, and that is enough for me; with that I shall
   be well content!" Alas, poor fool, the snow melts not sooner than the
   joy of wealth, and the smoke of the chimney is as solid as the comfort
   of riches.

   But we must not miss the fifth act. See the rich man, our friend whom
   lately we saw married, whom we then saw in trouble, afterwards
   rejoicing and then prospering in business, has entered upon a green old
   age; he has retired, and has now come to use the world. You will notice
   that in my text this is the last act of the drama. The world says he
   has been a wise man and has done well, for all men will praise thee
   when thou doest well for thyself. Now he keeps a liberal table, a fine
   garden, excellent horses, and many servants, he has all the comforts in
   fact that wealth can command, and as you look around his noble park, as
   you gaze at his avenue of fine old trees, or stay a day or two at the
   family mansion and notice all its luxuries, you hear your friend
   saying, "Ay, there is something very real here; what do you think of
   this?" When we hint that the gray hairs of the owner of all these
   riches betoken that his time is short, and that if this be all he has
   he is a very poor man, for he will soon have to leave it, and that his
   regrets in leaving will make his death more pitiable than that of a
   pauper, our friend replies, "Ah! ah! you are always talking in this
   way. I tell you this is not a play. I believe it is all real and
   substantial, and I am not, by any talking of yours, to be made to think
   that it is unsubstantial and will soon be gone." O world, thou hast
   fine actors, to cheat men so well, or else mortal man is an easy fool,
   taken in thy net like the fishes of the sea. The whole matter is most
   palpably a mere show, but yet men give their souls to win it.
   Wherefore, O sons of men, are ye thus beside yourselves? "Wherefore do
   ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that
   which satisfieth not?"

   Dear friends, I have put before your mind's eye a fair picture of that
   which men who live by sight and not by faith regard as being the chief
   end of man, and the real object of his being. It is to be married; to
   pass through the trials and joys of life with decency, to trade and
   grow rich, and at last to use the comforts of this world without abuse:
   a very comfortable and quiet picture, by no means the representation we
   should have to present before you of the profligate, He profane, the
   dissolute, or the debauched. There is nothing here but what is proper
   and right, and yet everything is improper and everything becomes wrong
   at once if these be thought to be the substantial things for which an
   immortal spirit is to spend its fires, and for which an undying soul is
   to exhaust its powers.

   II. Let us now take the CHRISTIAN VIEW OF THIS DRAMA.

   "Life is real; life is earnest:" it is real thus far to the Christian,
   it is real for work and activity for God; it is real in the solemn
   responsibility which it brings; it is real in the gratitude which we
   owe to God for the comforts which he is pleased to bestow; it is real
   to us so far as we can see God therein, and can turn everything to
   God's glory. The unreality of this world to a Christian, is found in
   the fact that time is short. This is the wand which torches the
   substance and makes it, before the eye of wisdom, dissolve into a
   shade. Time is short!

   When the apostle declares that they that have wives, should be as
   though they had none, he does not teach us to despise the marriage
   state, but not to seek our heaven in it, nor let it hinder our serving
   the Lord. It is supposed that there are some things which a man without
   a wife and family can do--those things the man with a wife and family
   should do. It is supposed that a man without a wife can give his time
   to the cause of God: the man with a wife should do the same, and he
   will not find it difficult to do so if God hath blessed him with one
   who will second all his holy endeavors. It is supposed that a man
   without a wife has no care: a man with a wife should have none, for he
   should cast all his cares on God who careth for him. "He that careth
   not for his own house is worse than a heathen man and a publican;" and
   yet the apostle says, in the verse following my text, "But I would have
   you without carefulness;" for we should learn to live by faith. The man
   who has a large family, and many things to exercise his mind, should
   yet, through the teaching of the Holy Spirit, lye as quietly and
   comfortably as though he had none, depending and resting by simple
   faith upon the providence and goodness of God. Then, again, it is
   supposed that an unmarried man will find it easier to die, for there
   will be none of that sorrow at leaving his beloved family: the man with
   a wife and family should, by faith, find it just as easy since the
   promise runs, "Leave thy fatherless children, and let thy widows trust
   in me." Full of the same faithful tenderness and affection which
   another husband would exhibit, and even excelling in love and kindness,
   yet the Christian should look up to the divine Lord who is the husband
   of the widow, and with confidence leave his offspring, and bid them
   trust in his God. May God the Holy Ghost teach us how to walk in our
   households, loving ever and yet remembering that all our kindred shall
   pass away.

   Again, there is the second act--weeping. Every Christian man must weep;
   but the Apostle says that our sorrows are to be regarded by us, because
   time is short, as though they were no sorrows at all. A man who knows
   that his trials will not last long, can be cheerful under them. If he
   sees a Father's hand in the midst of every adversity, and believes that
   when he is tried he shall come forth like gold from the furnace; if he
   knows with the Psalmist that "weeping may endure for the night, but
   that joy cometh in the morning," why then grief has lost its weight,
   and sorrow has lost its sting; and while the man weeps he yet rejoices,
   seeing the rainbow of the covenant painted on the cloud. Happy man,
   who, under bereavement, under crosses, and losses, can still cast his
   burden upon God, and can say, "Although the fig tree shall not blossom,
   neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive shall fail,
   and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the
   fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in
   the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation!" The Christian man is
   bound to live above his sorrows; he weeps, for "Jesus wept;" he may
   mourn, for the faithful have been mourners often, but he must not so
   mourn and weep as to be eaten up with grief; over the tops of the
   rolling waves he must see the haven of peace, and rejoice evermore.

   So is it in the third part. The Christian has his rejoicings, and he is
   not forbidden to be happy; indeed, he is commanded to rejoice; and the
   things of this life he may freely enjoy with the double zest of the
   mercy itself, and of the God who gave it to him. But still, believer,
   in all thy joys, remember to hold them with a loose hand. Never so hold
   thy joys as if they were all in all to thee. Though it be wife, or
   child, or property, or health, or wealth, or fame, still ever stand
   ready to surrender all into thy Father's hand, feeling that these,
   after all, are not thy joys; that thou hast better springs to drink
   from than those which earth's summers can dry up, and that thou hast
   rivers of pleasure deeper and broader than any which earth's winter
   shall be able to freeze. Do thou still stand steadily to this, that, as
   earth cannot cast thee down to despair, so it cannot lift thee up so as
   to make thee forget thy God. Learn in these things to rejoice as though
   thou hadst them not, and let this be thy solace, that thy name is
   written in heaven.

   So, too, in the matter of buying and possessing. It is not wrong for a
   Christian to trade and to trade well. I cannot see any reason why a
   Christian should be a fool; in fact, those who are fools in business
   are very often a great dishonor to the Christian religion, for a fool
   is very often first-cousin, if not father, to a knave. But, still,
   while we buy and sell it should always be thus--"This is not my real
   trade; this is not the way in which I really get rich, for my treasure
   is beyond the skies, where moth devours not, and where rust cannot
   consume." Handle these things, brethren, knowing that they take to
   themselves wings and flee away; look at them as transient objects which
   are to be used and sanctified in the passing, not your own, but lent to
   you for a time; to be repaid at last, with interest, in the day when
   the Master saith, "Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou mayest
   be no longer steward." A man may be as rich as Croesus, and his wealth
   will never hurt him if he does not hold it with a tight hand; and a man
   may be as happy as happiness can make him here, and yet it will not
   hurt him if he learns to keep it under his feet. But oh! when one's
   rejoicings or possessions get the upper hand of us there is as dreadful
   a drowning in a sea of pleasure as in a sea of misery. Keep before your
   mind the words of our sweet singer--

   "To thee we owe our wealth and friends,

   And health, and safe abode;

   Thanks to thy name for meaner things,

   But they are not my God.

   What empty things are all the skies,

   And this inferior clod!

   There's nothing here deserves my joys,

   There's nothing like my God."

   The last scene is the using of the things of this life. The creatures
   of God are given us to be used. John the Baptist may be an ascetic, but
   the Son of Man is come eating and drinking. The Christian man knows
   that the mercies which God has given him are to be used, but while he
   uses them he must use them as though he did not use them. That is a
   high philosophy which I fear me not many of us have learned, the
   philosophy of the apostle when he said, "I have learned in whatsoever
   state I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be abased, and
   I know how to abound." That man is the fullgrown and true Christian
   whom circumstances cannot alter! He trusts in God when he is penniless,
   and he trusts in his God just the same when he is rich; he rests on God
   when he can enjoy nothing, and he rests on him just the same when he
   can enjoy everything; he learned to build on the Rock of Ages when he
   had no comfort, and he builds on the Rock of Ages now, when he has
   every comfort! This, I take it, is where the apostle would have us
   brought. To the true Christian the things of this world are only real
   so far as they involve responsibility; but, seeing that time is short,
   he looks on life as men look upon a play; he sees a monarch strut, and
   he says, "Ah! he is to pull off his robes behind the stage!" He sees a
   peasant or a beggar, and he smiles and thinks of the time when the king
   and the peasant shall be equal, and the servant and his lord shall
   stand before one tribunal to give an account of the things done in the
   body. Send your souls longing after real and unchanging joys, for these
   splendid, gaudy, shifting scenes, mock the beholder and delude his
   hopes. Gorgeous as the colors of the bubble, and quite as frail,
   farewell ye worthless things, our spirit leaves you for eternal
   mansions in the skies.

   III. And now, dear friends, I want your attention a few minutes while I
   point you to THE CURTAIN WHICH IS SOON TO DROP UPON ALL THESE THINGS,
   it bears this short device, "TIME IS SHORT."

   It is very difficult to keep men in mind of the fact that they are
   mortal. We confess that we are mortal, but we profess by our actions
   that we are immortal. Said a man of eighty-two concerning another of
   seventy, when he wanted to buy his land and could not get it at the
   price he wished--"Never mind, So-and-so is an old man, he will soon be
   dead, and then I'll buy it." Though he was ten or twelve years older
   than the other, yet the other must of course, soon die, while he, in
   his own thoughts, must live for many a year. How short time is! Do we
   not, dear friends, get more and more that impression? I am but young
   compared with very many of you, yet the impression constantly grows
   upon my mind. Why, it seems but the day before yesterday when I plucked
   the first early primrose of spring, while the flowers were breaking up
   from under the earth, and the buds were ready to burst from the sheath!
   It was only as yesterday that we were walking in the fields and were
   remarking that the corn was just beginning to be tinged with the golden
   hue of harvest! Only a few Sabbaths ago I was talking to you of Ruth in
   the harvest-fields, and of the heavily-laden waggon that was pressed
   down with sheaves; and now the leaves are almost all gone; but few
   remain upon the trees; these frosty nights and strong winds have swept
   the giants of the forest till their limbs are bare, and the hoar frosts
   plate them with silver. Then, before we shall have time to burn the
   winter's log, we shall see the snow-drops and the yellow crocus
   heralding another spring! At what a rate we whirl along! Childhood
   seems to travel in a waggon, but manhood at express-speed. As we grow
   older I am told that the speed increases till the gray-headed old man
   looks back upon all his life as being but a day; and I suppose, if we
   could live to be a hundred and thirty we should feel the same, till,
   like Jacob, we should say, "Few and evil have been the days of thy
   servant!" and, if we could live as long as Methuselah, I doubt not our
   life would appear shorter still. How time flies, not only by the
   measurement of the seasons, but by ourselves! A few days ago I trudged
   with my satchel on my back to school, or joined in boyish sport. How
   lately was it when the boy became a youth, and must be doing something,
   and was teaching other boys as he had been taught in his day. It was
   but yesterday I came to Park Street to address some few of you, and yet
   how time has fled since then, till now some nine years of our ministry
   have passed. No weaver's shuttle, no arrow from a bow, no swift post,
   no meteor seems to fly at a rate so wonderful as does our life! We
   heard of one the other day who had seen Wesley preach, and so we find
   ourselves side-by-side with the last century, and those old people have
   known some others in their youth who told them of the yet older time,
   and you find that going through the history of some ten or twelve
   persons you are carried back to the days of William the Conqueror, and
   you see our country taken by the Normans, and then you fly back to
   ancient British times as with a thought. You no longer say, "How long
   the nation has existed!" for it is as a sleep. You stand by some old
   cliff and see a deposit of shells, and as you remember that it may have
   taken a million of years to have formed that bed, you think--"What is
   man? and what is time? It is not here, but gone!" We have only to think
   of what time is to conclude at once that time is not! It is but a
   little interlude in the midst of the vast eternity; a narrow neck of
   land jutting out into the great, dread, and unfathomable sea of
   everlastingness!

   But while time is thus short, its end is absolutely sure. That curtain
   yonder must fall soon! It must fall; it is inevitable. I cannot prevent
   my death by the most regular habits of life; the most skillful
   physician cannot preserve my life for me; a host of angels, should they
   swear to make me immortal, could not! When the time comes, die I must!
   And, as my death is inevitable, so it may be very near. Let each man
   remember that! How soon it may be we cannot tell! Every Sabbath there
   are some in this house who are dead before the next Sabbath. I am not
   now venturing a guess; it is a matter of fact, a matter of fact, too,
   that comes under my own cognizance very frequently. According to our
   population and the gradual number of deaths, there must be some out of
   this congregation here this morning who will have gone the way of all
   flesh before next Sabbath-day! There was one--I look at her seat now,
   and a brother sitting near by looks there with sorrow!--who was with us
   one Sabbath-day, and we soon heard that she had gone to enjoy the
   Eternal Sabbath! At a Church-meeting last week, no less than three of
   our sisters were reported as having fallen asleep in Jesus within a
   week. Ah! how near is death to us! Perhaps he now stands looking over
   thy shoulder, young man; God holds back his hand, but the dart of death
   is close to thy heart, and soon,--ah, how soon!--may you be taken to
   the place appointed for all living! Go, thou strong man, and remember
   that thou art a mass of feebleness! Go, thou young man, and remember
   that death reaps green corn! Go, thou old man, and expect the sickle!
   And go, thou rich man, and remember that thou shalt soon leave
   everything that thou hast, and then where art thou if thou hast no
   treasure in heaven, if thou hast not laid up in store for immortality?

   And I must add here that, to those who have no God, death, while
   inevitable and very near, will be most awful and tremendous! There was
   a dreadful story told in the papers of this last week. At the seaport
   town of Garliestown one day last week, certain workmen were busy
   preparing a better berth for a vessel which seems to have taken the
   ground a little too soon. On a sudden some one raised a cry that the
   ship was listing over, and while some four men were able to escape, one
   poor fellow was unable to do so, and the ship fell upon his lower
   extremities and loins. Now this was thought, perhaps, to be no great
   danger, for they could take away the sludge and extricate him. So they
   began to shore the ship, and willing hands brought ropes and blocks,
   and wedges, and earnest strength. But they soon discovered that the
   thing was impossible from the nature of the bottom of the river, and
   from the position of the cargo, which, I suppose, they could not
   speedily remove. The man was jammed under the bulwarks, and must remain
   fixed there without hope. There was just one awful hour before the
   coming tide would reach the spot. Well might a solemn hush succeed the
   frantic labors of the townsmen as death was seen riding on the
   advancing flood. The poor creature had to lie there that hour as the
   tide came gently in. A minister stood his side praying with him; let us
   trust that his soul found peace with God! But O the terror of his
   position; well might he say, "Cover my head, that I may not see the
   water." Steadily the cold unpitying waters flowed on until a corpse was
   hidden where an hour or so before a strong man labored. This is a
   graphic picture of the position of every ungodly man! He does not know
   it, but the waves of time are coming up about him now, and we cannot
   help him to escape. The load of his sins is on his loins: he cannot
   deliver himself; the great waters of God's wrath must swallow him up
   quick. O, sinner, would that I could save thee! Alas, it is not in my
   power! But there is an arm that can deliver thee; there is one who can
   lift the burden off thee, and say to thee, "Be free!" Believe in him
   and thou shalt never die! Trust thou in his power and rest thyself on
   his love, and thou shalt escape as a bird out of the snare of the
   fowler; and when death cometh it shall be no death to thee, but a
   peaceful migration from the land of shadows to the world of substance.
   God help us to be wise, that we may remember our latter end!

   I would say a few more words to the sinner. I cannot think, O
   worldling, why thou shouldest love this world so much when it is so
   soon to vanish! In the old Greek cities they had a king every year,
   and, because it was so poor a thing to be a king for only one year and
   then to be a common man again, all the citizens dreaded to be kings.
   How canst thou long to be rich, when thou art only to be rich for so
   short a time? When the sailor is just about to furl his sail because he
   is near the port, he will not fret himself with some little
   inconvenience in the ship; and wherefore art thou so sore vexed with
   all these little trials, when thou art so near the eternal haven? When
   men buy property on a short lease, they will not give much for it, for
   they are only to have it for a brief term; wherefore spendest thou thy
   soul to buy this world? What will it profit thee, if thou gain it, if
   thy soul be lost? When men have a house and they are soon to leave it,
   they will not lay out much in repairing it; wherefore, then, caress
   thou so much for thy body? Why mindest thou so much this life; the bell
   is even now trembling to toll for thee, and the grave is yawning that
   it may swallow thee up? Oh man! Oh man! I would that thou wert wise!
   Thou art to live for ever, for ever, for ever, either

   "In flames that no abatement know,

   Though briny tears for ever flow."

   or else in joy beyond degree. Which shall it be with thee, man? If thou
   diest as thou art, O sinner, remember, there remaineth nothing for thee
   but a fearful looking for of judgment and of fiery indignation! I pray
   thee by the love of God, to consider thy ways. Thus saith the Lord unto
   thee this day by my lips, as truly as he spake to Hezekiah by the
   prophet of old, "Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die and not
   live." How wilt thou stand, sinner, in the day when the Lord cometh to
   make inquisition for sin, and to avenge their iniquity upon the heads
   of the unpardoned? Fly, sinner; God help thee by his grace to fly now
   to yonder open door, where Jesus waits to receive thee and to put away
   thy sin. Whosoever believeth on him is not condemned. Like as Moses
   lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so the Son of man is
   lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have
   everlasting life.

   IV. Come, come, ye wise men, rise and leave this theater, we have seen
   enough of it. "The fashion of this world passeth away;" and for you and
   for me happy shall it be when it shall have passed away for ever. But
   is there nothing real? Can I do nothing real here? Is there nothing I
   can do that shall last for ever? Yes, the soul is lasting. Then let me
   see to my own soul. Let me make my calling and election sure, for I
   shall have been of all fools the most mad, if I shall have trifled with
   these things and yet have neglected my soul. The Roman emperor,
   Claudius, once invaded Great Britain, but his performance only
   consisted of gathering pebbles and shells from the sea-coast. This
   shall be my triumph, this my sole reward, if here in this world I live
   only to gather wealth. At the last I shall be as though I gathered
   pebbles, for these things shall be of no value to me if my soul shall
   perish. O Lord, by thy rich grace set me upon a sure foundation, and
   make me right before thy face.

   Yes, there are some real things besides my own soul. There are other
   men's souls. What am I doing for them? Am I teaching, am I preaching,
   or, if I am not doing this, am I helping others to preach? Am I doing
   my best to add to the kingdom of Christ by the ingathering of
   immortals? Have I a sphere in the ragged school or in tract
   distributing, or am I helping in some way or other to do good? For, if
   not, my life is a play, I am doing nothing real; I am only hurrying
   here and there, and when it comes to the last I shall have been as a
   workmen that has neglected his own work to play with children in the
   streets! Dig up your buried talents, O idlers. Work while it is called
   to-day, O ye who are given to slumber.

   Yes, there is something real--there is Christ's Church. The Church that
   is to shine like the stars in heaven for ever, the Bride of the
   Lamb--what am I doing for Her? Do I seek the good of Jerusalem? As a
   member of the Church, do I contribute to its strength? Do I give of my
   substance to her efforts, and of my talents to her doings? Do I cast
   myself wholly into the arms of Christ, and work for him! Yes, there is
   something real--Jesus is so. Am I glorifying him here on earth? When I
   see him in his poor people, do I feed him? When he shivers at my door
   in the garb of poverty, do I clothe him? When I know that he hath need,
   do I visit him? If so, I am doing real things. If I devote my life to
   God, to Christ, to his Church, to the souls of men, and if my own soul
   is saved, then I am living; but if not, I am dead while I live. "Let us
   live while we live!" Alas! how many are dying while they live,
   drivelling while they live! Oh! the scores of pounds we spend on
   ourselves; the hundreds we give to our own comfort! And where is that?
   It is gone like smoke! But that which is given to God lasts and
   endures; it is treasured up in God's bank; that which is given to the
   poor and needy is made--though unrighteous mammon--to be treasured up
   in heaven! But I know many practical persons will say, "Yes, this is a
   very pretty speech for a young minister; but these ministers do not
   understand business; they cannot be expected to understand temporal
   matters." I would to God ye understood them half so well, for our
   understanding in this matter we know is sound; and when you shall come
   to see these things in the light of eternity streaming between the
   curtains of your dying bed, you will understand, then, that there was
   nothing worth living for but God, and Christ, and his Church; and you
   will give your verdict then with mine to this, that truly to live must
   be Christ, or else to die never can be gain!

   God add his blessing, and may some be led to trust in Jesus this
   morning!

                    The Royal Pair in Their Glorious Chariot

   A Sermon

   (No. 482)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, November 30th, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
   perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the merchant?
   Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are about
   it, of the valiant of Israel. They all hold swords, being expert in
   war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the
   night. King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. He
   made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the
   covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for
   the daughters of Jerusalem. Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and
   behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in
   the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his
   heart."--Solomons Song 3:6-11.

   GREAT PRINCES IN THE EAST are in the habit of travelling in splendid
   palanquins, which are at the same time chariots and beds. The person
   reclines within, screened by curtains from public view; a body-guard
   protects the equipage from robbers, and blazing torches light up the
   path along which the travelers proceed. King Solomon, in this Song,
   describes the Church of Christ, and Christ himself, as travailing
   through the world in such a palanquin. The day is coming when both our
   divine Lord and his chosen bride shall be revealed in glory before the
   eyes of all men. The present age is the period of concealment--the
   mystical Solomon and his beloved Solyma are both on earth, but they are
   unseen of men; like the ark of old they dwell within curtains; only the
   anointed priests of God can discern their beauties, and even these gaze
   rather by faith than by sight. "Lo I am with you alway, even unto the
   end of the world," is certainly true, for Jesus is here; but equally
   correct is that word of Peter, "Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom,
   though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory." He is here in the reality, power, and
   influence of his presence, but he is not here as to the visibility of
   his kingdom and person, for we wait with our loins girt about, and with
   patience of hope, until the revelation of Jesus Christ. The portion of
   the blessed canticle now before us is, we think, descriptive of the
   progress of the hidden Christ through the world. He has been borne
   along, in very truth, but he himself has been so little perceived of
   men, that they even ask the question, "Who is this that cometh out of
   the wilderness?" He is not now manifested openly to men. If any should
   say, "Lo here!" or "Lo there! this is Christ!" believe them not, for
   Christ is not as yet seen. When he doth come he shall be as perceptible
   as the lightning's flash, which every man's eye discerneth without the
   need of an instructor. So, also, with his true Church. She also is
   hidden like her Lord, and though her hand, her foot, or her face may be
   sometimes seen, yet the whole elect body has never yet been beheld. If
   any say, "Lo, here is the Church of Christ!" or "Lo there!" believe
   them not, for it is a fact that there is no corporation of men of which
   we can say exclusively or even universally, "Lo, this is the Church of
   Christ." There are tares growing with the wheat in the best guarded
   field, and on the other hand no one enclosure contains all the wheat.
   The true Church of Christ is scattered here and there, it is found
   amongst all denominations, and there is not one denomination of which
   you can say, "This only is the Church of Christ, or all its members
   belong to the body of Christ's spouse." Just now the mystical bride is
   in a certain sense as invisible as her husband. Behold, then, the
   betrothed ones carried through the world in the sumptuous chariot of
   which we have to speak this morning.

   I must now claim your attention while I notice, first, the glory of the
   progress of Christ through the world, as described in the sixth verse;
   secondly, the security of Christ's cause, as represented in thy seventh
   and eighth; thirdly, the superlative excellence of it, as described in
   the ninth and tenth; and lastly, our joyful duties with regard to it,
   as openly declared in the eleventh.

   I. First, then, THE MAGNIFICENT PROGRESS, THE GLORIOUS ON-GOING OF THE
   CHURCH AND HER LORD THROUGH THE WORLD.

   "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke,
   perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the
   merchant?" The equipage excites the attention of the on-looker; his
   curiosity is raised, and he asks, "Who is this?" Now, in the first
   progress of the Christian Church, in her very earliest days, there were
   persons who marvelled greatly; and though they set down the wonders of
   the day of Pentecost to drunkenness, yet "they were all amazed, and
   were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?" In after
   years, many a heathen philosopher said, "What is this new power which
   is breaking the idols in pieces, changing old customs, making even
   thrones unsafe-what is this?" By-and-bye, in the age of the
   Reformation, there were cowled monks, cardinals in their red hats, and
   bishops, and princes, and emperors, who all said, "What is this? What
   strange doctrine has come to light?" In the times of the modern
   reformation, a century ago, when God was pleased to revive his Church
   through the instrumentality of Whitfield and his brethren, there were
   many who said, "What is this new enthusiasm, this Methodism? Whence
   came it, and what power is this which it wields?" And, doubtless,
   whenever God shall be pleased to bring forth his Church in power, and
   to make her mighty among the sons of men, the ignorance of men will be
   discovered breaking forth in yonder, for they will say, "Who is this?"
   Spiritual religion is as much a novelty now as in the day when Grecian
   sages scoffed at it on Mars' Hill. The true Church of God is a stranger
   and pilgrim still; an alien and a foreigner in every land; a speckled
   bird; a dove in the midst of ravens; a lily among thorns.

   The ignorance of men concerning spiritual things is not, however,
   caused by the darkness of the things themselves, for Christ and his
   Church are the great lights of the world. When great personages
   traveled in their palanquins, and more especially on marriage
   processions, they were attended by a number of persons who, at night,
   carried high up in the air burning cressets which gave forth a blaze of
   light. Sometimes these lights were simply torches carried in the hands
   of running footmen; at other times they were a sort of iron basket
   lifted high into the air, upon poles, from which went up a pillar of
   smoke and flame. Our text says "Who is this that cometh out of the
   wilderness like pillars of smoke?" a beautiful illustration of the fact
   that wherever Christ and his cause are carried, light is a sure
   accompaniment. Into whatsoever region the gospel may journey, her every
   herald is a flash of light, her every minister a flaming fire. God
   maketh his Churches the golden candlesticks, and saith unto his
   children "Ye are the lights of the world," is certainly as ever God
   said "Let there be light," and there was light over the old creation,
   so does he say, whenever his Church advances, "Let there be light" and
   there is light. Dens of darkness, where the bats of superstition had
   folded their wings and hung themselves up for perpetual ease, have been
   disturbed by the glare of these divine flambeaux; the innermost caverns
   of superstition and sin, once black with a darkness which might be
   felt, have been visited with a light above the brightness of the sun.
   "The people which sat in darkness have seen a great light, and to them
   which sat in the region and shadow of death light has sprung up." Thus
   saith the Lord unto the nation where his kingdom cometh, "Arise, shine,
   for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord hath risen upon thee!"
   Bear ye the Church of Christ to the South Seas; carry Christ and his
   spouse in his palanquin to the Caffre, the Hottentot, or the Esquimaux,
   and everywhere the night of death is ended, and the morning with its
   glorious dawn has come. High lift your lamps, ye servants of our Lord.
   High lift up the cross of the Redeemer; for in him is light, and the
   light in the life of men.

   But you will tell me that our text rather speaks of "pillars of smoke"
   than of sparkling lamps. Brethren, the smoke is but the effect of the
   flame, and even the pillar of smoke is luminous. What is the smoke that
   has attended the Church? What but the deaths of her martrys, the
   sufferings of her confessors, the patient endurance of her valiant
   sons? Wherever she goes, the thick smoke of her suffering goeth up to
   heaven. "We are alway delivered unto death," said the apostle. The
   cause of truth involves a perpetual sacrifice; her smoke ascendeth for
   ever. Black smoke I say it is in the eye of man, but unto God it is a
   sweet-smelling savor. Never did fat of rams, or the fat of kidnies of
   fed beasts, smell so sweetly before the Most High as the faith, the
   love, the courage, which has ascended up to heaven from the dauntless
   heroes of the Church in past ages when at the stake they have been
   faithful even unto death. Suffering, and grief, and woe are the lot of
   the spouse of the despised and rejected Savior, but all these are as
   things of nought if thereby she may scatter that terrible blackness
   which blinds the face of man and makes him a stranger to his God.

   It often happens that oriental monarchs of immense possessions, are not
   content with burning common coals in these cressets, but frequently
   consume sandal-wood and other woods which give forth a delightful
   smell; or else, if they use ordinary coals, they sprinkle upon them
   frankincense and myrrh, so that a delicious perfume is spread on all
   sides. In the olden times, they also went to great expense in obtaining
   drugs, which the merchants collected from all parts of the earth, and
   these were carefully compounded into the renowned "powders of the
   merchants," which yielded a delicious variety of delicate perfumes, not
   to be produced by any one aromatic essence. Our inspired poet describes
   the travelling procession of the royal pair and fails not to dwell upon
   the delightful perfume of myrrh and frankincense, with all the powders
   of the merchant, "which make the wilderness smell as a garden of
   roses." Wherever the Church of Christ proceeds, though her pathway is a
   desert, though she marches through a howling wilderness, she scatters
   the richest perfume. The page of history were only worthy to be blotted
   in oblivion were it not for the sweet odours which the Church has left
   upon it. Look at all past ages, and the track of the Church is still
   redolent with all the richest fragrance of human virtue and divine
   grace. Wherever the Church advances she makes manifest the savor of the
   knowledge of Christ in every place! Men believe in Jesus, and unto the
   Lord faith has all the fragrance of myrrh. They love Jesus; and love in
   the esteem of heaven is better than frankincense. Loving Christ they
   endeavor to be like him, till patience, humility, brotherly-kindness,
   truthfulness, and all things that are honest, lovely, and of good
   repute, like "powders of the merchant," are spread abroad throughout
   the whole earth. Tell me where the Church is not, and I will tell you
   where sin reigns; tell me where Christ and his Church are carried, and
   I will tell you where you shall find every virtue that can adorn
   humanity, and every excellence that can magnify the excellence of the
   grace of God. If you would find an antidote for the deadly exhalations
   which lurk among this vorld's deserts of sin, if you would destroy the
   foul pestilence which reigns in the darkness of heathenism, of Popery,
   and of infidelity, cry unto the Mighty One--"Arise, thou unknown
   traveler, arise, and bid thy servants carry thee into the midst of all
   this misery and death! The light of thy flaming torches shall scatter
   the darkness, and the buming of thy precious perfumes shall say unto
   evil--'Fold thy wings!' and unto the pestilence of sin--'Get thee back
   unto thy den!'"

   Among the ten wonders which Jewish tradition ascribes to the temple, we
   find that the rain never extinguished the fire of the wood which was
   laid in order upon the altar, nor did the wind ever conquer the pillar
   of smoke so as to disperse or bend it. Verily it is so with the Church
   of God, as she cometh out of the wilderness: who shall quench her
   flaming lamp, or stay the incense of her golden censers? Ride on, Great
   Prince, and bear thy spouse with thee in thy majestic chariot, till
   thou hast lit the world with thy divine light, and hast made it a
   temple filled with a cloud of incense of sweet smell to the nostrils of
   Jehovah!

   II. We have, secondly, to notice THE SECURITY OF CHRIST'S CHURCH AT ALL
   TIMES.

   Of course when travelling through a wilderness, a royal procession was
   always in danger of attack. Arabs prowled around; wandering Bedouins
   were always prepared to fall upon the caravan; and more especially was
   this the case with a marriage procession, because then the robbers
   might expect to obtain many jewels, or, if not, a heavy ransom for the
   redemption of the bride or bridegroom by their friends. What shall I
   say of the attacks which have been made upon the Church of Christ, and
   upon Christ himself? They have been incessant. When one form of evil
   has been routed, another has presented itself. Evil teems with
   children. The frogs and lice of Egypt were not more numerous than the
   enemies of the Lord's anointed and his bride. Every day produces new
   battles. These attacks arise from all quarters; sometimes from the
   world, and sometimes, alas! from even professed members of the Church.
   Adversaries lurk everywhere, and until the Church and her Lord shall be
   revealed in the splendor of the Millennium, having left the wilderness
   for ever, we must expect to find her molested on every side. My dear
   brethren, we know that Christ's cause in the world is always safe
   because of divine protection, and because the legions of God's angels
   keep watch and ward over the saints. But we have something more
   tangible than this. Our gracious God has been pleased to commit unto
   men the ministry of Christ. "Unto the angels hath he not put in
   subjection the world to come, whereof we speak." The Lord ordaineth
   that chosen men should be the protectors of his Church; not that they
   have any power as of themselves to do anything, but He girdeth the weak
   with strength and maketh the feeble mighty; so then, men, even the sons
   of men stand in array around the travelling palanquin of Christ, to
   guard both the bridegroom and the bride.

   Read the 7th and 8th verses carefully, and you will notice that there
   are enough swordsmen. "Threescore valiant men are about it." There are
   always enough men chosen of God to guard the Church. Poor Unbelief
   holds up her hands and cries--"Ah! the good men are all dead; Zion is
   under a cloud; the Lord hath taken away the great men; we have no
   valiant defenders of the faith, none such as this crisis may require!"
   Ah! Unbelief, let the Lord say unto thee as he did unto Elias--"Yet
   have I left me seven-thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not
   bowed unto Baal." There shall be just as many warriors as the crisis
   shall require. We do not know where the men are to come from, but the
   Lord will provide. There may be sitting in the Sunday school to-day a
   child who shall one day shake this nation from one end to the other;
   there may be even here, unknown, obscure, and unobserved, the man whom
   God will make strong to rebuke the infamous infidelity of our age. We
   know not where the anointing rests. We, in our folly, would anoint
   Eliab or Abinadab, but God hath chosen David, the shepherd's boy, and
   he will bring him forth and teach him how to hurl the stone at
   Goliath's brow. Tremble not, neither be ye afraid; God who makes man
   and makes man's mouth, will find the sixty men when the sixty shall be
   needed. "The Lord gave the word, great was the company of them that
   published it." The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh
   shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

   Observe that these warriors are men of the right mettle. "Yes," says
   poor trembling Little-Faith, "we have hosts of men, but they are not
   like the greathearts of old; they have not the qualifications which the
   age requires." Ah! but remember, about the bed of Solomon there are
   "threescore valiant men;" and glory be unto my Master, while I may not
   flatter the ministry, I must not dishonor him by believing that he has
   left his Church without valiant defenders. There are Luthers still
   living who bid defiance to all adversaries; men who can say, "We count
   not our lives dear unto us that we may finish our course with joy, and
   fulfill the ministry which the Lord hath delivered unto us." Fear not;
   you may not at present know the valor of the Lord's body-guard, but
   when the Church's battle grows hotter than just now, suddenly there
   shall be seen a champion stalking to the front of the battle, and men
   shall say, "Who is this? How he wields that battle-axe! How he splits
   the armor of his foes! See how he piles them heaps on heaps, and mounts
   that hill of slaughtered enemies to smite a greater foe! Who is this?"
   And the answer shall be, "This is a man whom God hath found; the world
   knew not of him, but God has trained him in the camps of Dan, and now
   the Spirit moveth him to smite the Philistines.

   "Ah!" I think I hear you say, "but though there may be so many men, and
   men of the right sort, I am afraid they are not in the right place."
   Look again at the text. It is written--"Threescore valiant men are
   ABOUT IT;" that is, there are some on that side, and some on this, some
   before, and some behind; they are all round the travelling chariot of
   Christ. "I wish there might be one in our parish," says one. Pray for
   him, and he who has promised to send you all good things may yet send
   him to you. "Pray ye the Lord of the harvest that he may send forth
   laborers into his harvest." It is singular how God sometimes raises a
   mighty man, in this denomination, then in that, and then in the other.
   Suppose any body of Christians should try to monopolize all the valiant
   men themselves; why, they could not do it, because every side of the
   royal bed must be guarded, and in his own place each man is set for the
   defense of the gospel. The Church is compassed about with mighties, who
   are under God to do great exploits. If the Lord guides the flight of
   sparrows, surely he knows how to dispose his ministers; and let the
   Church be well content to let them occupy their posts until the
   wilderness is past, and the glory shall be revealed. The Church often
   makes mistakes, and thinks she can make ministers, or at least choose
   their position. She can do no such thing. God sends the valiant man;
   all you can do is to recognize his valor, and accept him as your
   champion; beyond that you cannot go; this is God's work, not man's. A
   minister made by men, made valiant by human strength, had better betake
   himself at once ignominiously to his tent, for his disgrace will be
   certain. God who sends the men, knows where to put them, so that they
   may stand round about the bed, and leave no corner unprotected.

   Notice that these men are all well armed. The text says expressly,
   "They all hold swords." What swords are these? Every valiant man in
   Christ's Israel holds the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
   God. A man who is a good textuary will usually be a good divine; he who
   draws from the treasury of the written word will find his spoken word
   to be fruitful in profit to the people of God. If we use carnal reason;
   if we rely upon refinement, argument, eloquence, or any other form of
   the wisdom of man, we shall soon find our enemies will defeat us; but
   to ply the Word right and left; to give gospel cuts and strokes such as
   the devil himself cannot parry, this is to overcome the world through
   the Word of God. Besides this, and here is an opportunity for you all
   to carry swords--every valiant man in God's Israel carries the sword of
   prayer, which is comparable to those huge two-handed swords of the
   olden time, which the soldier lifted up and brought down with such
   tremendous force, as to cleave a man in halves: prayer is a weapon
   which no man can effectually resist. If you know how to use it, bring
   it down upon your foeman's head, and woe unto him! I would to God that
   in this Church there were found many of these valiant men of Israel!
   Indeed, would God all the Lord's servants were prophets, that it might
   be said of all of you that you hold swords. Your holy lives can be
   swords with which to smite your enemies. The tongues with which you
   speak of Christ lovingly, tenderly, persuasively--these may be weapons
   against our common enemy. Oh that when we hear the muster roll at last,
   it may be said of every Church-member that he held a sword! Do not
   tremble, ye timid ones, for the ark of the Lord; neither let your fears
   promote your unbelief; God knows full well how to give the right
   weapons to the right men, and his Church shall be secure even to the
   end.

   Further, my brethren, these men are not only well armed, but thy are
   well trained. They are all expert in war; men who have endured
   temptations themselves; men whose souls have been exercised, men who
   have slain both the lion and the bear, and are men of war from their
   youth. Christian ministers especially should be no novices, but both in
   the school of temptation, and in some school of the prophets, they
   should be disciplined for fight. May there be such found here! I look
   out daily for such among you as are taught of God, and much of my time
   is spent with our young soldiers to make them expert in war. O that the
   Lord would hear my prayers and bless our college with men, and means,
   and above all with his Spirit. Fools are not the men for this age. We
   want a sound knowledge of doctrine, practical power in preaching, and a
   thorough insight into the human heart; and where these by earnest
   prayer can be found in a man and further developed by careful teaching,
   we are bound to give our aid. Such men should be looked after, and no
   pains should be spared to bring them forth; in fact, dear friends, you
   ought to think it a high honor to be allowed to help in putting such
   men into working order. Oh! how I groan to get my friends to feel the
   importance of sending out trained young ministers. I give my time and
   my substance cheerfully, but when will the Christian Church help in
   this matter as it should?

   Further, these men were not only well-trained, but you will see that
   they were always ready. Each man has his sword upon his thigh, ready to
   be drawn forth. I know some nominal ministers who seem to me to carry
   no sword at all. They keep a sheath, a very handsome sheath, with a
   hilt at the top and a stick inside. What is the good of such men? We
   want men to have swords in their sheaths, men who can speak with power,
   and have the demonstration of the Spirit and the power thereof resting
   upon them. Such men should wear their swords where they are to be got
   at, so that when the adversary comes they may dash at him at once.
   Rejoice, O daughter of Zion, thy Lord hath not left thee, even at this
   day, without some such men!

   Observe also that these men were watchful, for "they had their sword on
   their thigh because of fear in the night." They never sleep, but watch
   always for the Church's interest. Pray ye that the Lord may raise up
   many such, who night and day with tears shall watch for the souls of
   men, and against the enemies of our Israel.

   Dear friends, some of you may at times be alarmed when you hear of
   attacks made upon the Bible. At one time it was thought that ethnology
   would prove that the human race could not be one; and Moses was
   terribly abused by some who said it was not possible that all of us
   could have come of one pair. That battle was fought, and you hear
   nothing of it now; it is over; learning and argument in the hand of God
   has routed those antagonists. Then they pelted us with shells, and
   bones of lizards. Geology threatened to dig our graves; but we have
   lived all through that struggle, and we have found geology to be a
   great blessing, for it has shed a new light on the first chapter of
   Genesis, and made us understand a great deal better what it meant.
   Another Amalekite advances to combat; this time it is with figures and
   numbers; we are to be speared with arithmetic, and slain with algebra!
   And what will be the result of it? Why, it will do the Bible a world of
   good, for we shall understand it better. I thank God whenever the Bible
   is attacked; for all those who know the times and seasons, begin to
   study just that part of Scripture more carefully, and then we get a
   clearer light shed upon it, and we find ourselves more confirmed than
   ever that this is the very truth, and that God hath revealed it to us.
   "Well, but who will take this matter up?" I do not know, and I do not
   particularly care, but I know my Master has his threescore valiant men
   round about his bed, and that each man has his sword upon his thigh
   because of fear in the night, and never mind what the battle may be,
   the end of it will be for God's glory, and there shall be progress with
   the chariot of Christ through that which seemed as if it must overthrow
   it. Cast aside your fears; rejoice, and be glad, O daughter of Zion!
   Thy Lord is with thee in the travelling chariot, and the threescore
   valiant men are watching against thy foes.

   III. Meanwhile, reposing in peace, let us notice THE EXCELLENCY OF THIS
   CHARIOT IN WHICH JESUS RIDES.

   It is not difficult to convey to persons the most unacquainted with
   Eastern manners and customs, an idea of what this palanquin is. It is a
   sort of large sedan in which one or two persons may recline with ease.
   Of course, this palanquin could not be made of gold or silver, because
   then it would be too heavy for carriage; it must be made of wood; hence
   King Solomon made a bed, or chariot, or palanquin, of the wood of
   Lebanon. Then there needs to be four pillars supporting the covering
   and the curtains; the pillars thereof are of silver. The bottom of it
   should be something massive, in order to sustain the weight of the
   person; the bottom thereof is of gold. The canopy on the top, is a
   covering of purple. Since to lie on gold would be very unpleasant, it
   is covered with delicate, daintily wrought carpets; and so we have the
   bottom thereof paved, or rather carpeted with love for the daughters of
   Jerusalem. Some delicate devices of needlework adorn the bottom of this
   bed-chariot in which the king and his spouse recline during their
   journey.

   The doctrines of the gospel are comparable, for their antiquity, for
   their sweet fragrance, for their incorruptibility, to the wood of
   Lebanon. The gospel of Christ never decays; Jesus Christ the same
   yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Not one single truth, bears any sign
   of rot. And to those souls that are enlightened from above, the gospel
   gives forth a fragrance far richer than the wood of Lebanon.

   "No beams of cedar or of fir,

   Can with thy precious truth compare."

   I rejoice to know concerning you as a Church, that the more you
   understand the doctrines of grace the better you love them. You are
   confirmed in the present faith, and well you may be, for our doctrine
   is worthy of your confidence. We are not afraid that any truth which
   Christ has uttered should be tried by the most stringent criticism, for
   not one single stone of all the bulwarks of Gospel doctrine can ever be
   removed out of its place. When cedars of Lebanon have yielded to the
   worm, even then shall the truth as it is in Jesus remain the same.

   As for the silver pillars which bear up the canopy, to what should I
   liken them but to the attributes of God which support and guarantee the
   efficiency of the great atonement of Christ beneath which we are
   sheltered. There is the silver pillar of God's justice. He cannot, he
   will not smite the soul that hides beneath the cross of Christ. If
   Christ hath paid the debt, how is it possible that God should visit
   again a second time the iniquity of his people, first on their Surety,
   and then again on themselves? Then stands the next, the solid pillar of
   his power. "They shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out
   of my hand; my Father which gave them me is greater than all, and none
   is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand." Then on the other side
   is the pillar of his love, a silver pillar indeed, bright and sparkling
   to the eye; love unchanging and eternal, strong as the power and fast
   as the justice which bear up the canopy on the other side. And here on
   this side stands immutability, another column upon which the atonement
   rests. If God could change, then might he cast away his blood-bought;
   but "because I am God and change not, therefore ye sons of Jacob
   rejoice." As for the covering of the chariot, it is of purple. I need
   not tell you where it was dyed. No Tyrian hues are mingled here. Look
   up, Christian, and delight thyself in that blood-red canopy which
   shelters thee from the sun by day and from the moon by night! From hell
   and heaven, from time and from eternity, art thou secured by this
   covering which is of purple. Oh! tempting theme to dilate upon the
   precious and glorious doctrine of atonement! Whenever our adversaries
   assail the Church, whatever may be the apparent object of their
   animosity, their real one is always the same, a desperate hatred to the
   great truth that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself,
   not imputing their trespasses unto them. Well, as they hate it, let us
   love it; and under it let us take our greatest delight.

   As for the bottom of this palanquin, which is of gold,--may not this
   represent the eternal purpose and counsel of God, that purpose which he
   formed in himself or ever the earth was? Pure was the decree of God,
   holy, wise, just, for his own glory, and most true; and as the precious
   things of the temple were all of gold, well may the basis of eternal
   love, an immutable and unchangeable decree, be compared to much fine
   gold. I do not know, brethren, how it is with you, but I find it most
   pleasant to have as the basis of my hope, the firm decree of God.
   Atonement covers me, I know, but still on this I must rest, Jehovah
   wills it; God decrees it; he hath said it, and it must be done; he hath
   commanded and it standeth fast. Oh! that golden sovereignty, whereon is
   written--"I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; it is not of him
   that willeth, nor of him that runneth." Dear brethren, the Apostle
   plainly tells us that this is the basis on which even the silver
   pillars rest, "for he hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
   Christ Jesus, according as he hath chosen us in him from before the
   foundation of the world."

   Then, to make this all soft and pleasant to recline upon, here is
   pavement of needlework. Soft cushions of love on which to rest. There
   is a double meaning here, for both the bride and bridegroom find rest
   in love. Our Lord finds rest in the love of his people. "Here will I
   dwell for ever." They do, as it were, make these carpets of needle-work
   in their love and affection for him, and in their trust and confidence
   in him; and here he rests. On the other hand, our Beloved spent his
   life to work for us our bed of rest, so that we must translate it "love
   of," as well as love for the daughters of Jerusalem." We rest in
   Christ's love; he rests in our love. Come, I need not explain further,
   brothers and sisters. Take your rest now to the full. You are married
   unto Christ; you are one with him; betrothed unto him in faithfulness,
   embraced in the arms of his affection. Fear not the noise of archers;
   the "threescore valiant men" protect you, and the king himself embraces
   you; now solace yourself with him; take your full of his sweet society,
   and say unto him from the bottom of your heart, "Let him kiss me with
   the kisses of his mouth, for his love is better than wine." Leave
   fighting for the evidences to the valiant men who can do it; as for
   you, ye daughters of Jerusalem, rest upon your Lord's bosom; leave
   conflict to the men ordained to fight, the men expert in war; as for
   you, be you expert in communion; understand the motions of Jesus'
   heart; look unto the lustre of his loving eyes; behold his beauties; be
   ravished with his divine affection to you; and now let your soul be
   satisfied with favor, and be full of the lovingkindness of the Lord!

   IV. We close, then, by noticing THE DUTY OF EVERY BELIEVING HEART
   newest in connection with the subject.

   Let every believer, while he recognizes himself as part of the Church
   inside the palanquin, yet look upon himself personally as one of the
   daughters of Zion, and let us each go forth this morning to meet King
   Solomon. It is not King David; King David is the type of Christ up to
   the time of his crucifixion--"despised and rejected of men, a man of
   sorrows and acquainted with grief," and yet King of the Jews. King
   Solomon is the type of Christ ever since the day when

   "They brought his chariot from above,

   To bear him to his throne."

   and, with sound of trumpet, conducted him to his Father's
   presence-chamber above. Now it is King Solomon; King Solomon for
   wealth, for wisdom, for dignity, for honor, for peace. He is the
   Wonderful, the Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the
   Prince of Peace, and therefore is he King Solomon going forth. Get up
   from your beds of sloth; rise from your chambers of ease; go forth, go
   forth to pray, to labor, to suffer; go forth to live in purity, leaving
   Babylon behind; go forth to walk with him alone, leaving even your
   kinsfolk and acquaintance if they will not follow with you. Wherefore
   tarriest thou at home when the King is abroad? "Behold the Bridegroom
   cometh, come ye forth to meet him," and behold King Solomon. To-day let
   your eye rest upon him. Let your eye behold the head that to-day is
   crowned with glory, wearing many crowns. Behold ye, too, his hands
   which once were pierced, but are now grasping the scepter. Look to his
   girdle where swing the keys of heaven, and death, and hell. Look to his
   feet, once pierced with iron, but now set upon the dragon's head.
   Behold his legs, like fine brass, as if they glowed in a furnace. Look
   at his heart, that bosom which heaves with love to you, and when you
   have surveyed him from head to foot exclaim, "Yea, he is the chief
   among ten thousand, and altogether lovely." Does sin prevail? Behold
   King Solomon. Have doubts and fears arisen? Behold King Jesus. Are you
   troubled, and does your enemy annoy you? Look up to him, behold king
   Solomon. I pray you remember the light in which you are to behold him.
   Do not think that Christ has lost his former power. Behold him as he
   was at Pentecost, with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in
   the day of his espousals. Oh! how glorious was our Lord when the Church
   crowned him with her zeal, and the arrows went abroad, and three
   thousand fell slain by his right hand to be made alive by the breath of
   his mouth! Oh, how these early saints crowned him, when they brought of
   their substance and laid it at the apostle's feet, neither did any man
   count that ought he had was his own. They crowned him with their
   heart's purest love; the Church had on her brow her bridal-wreath, and
   her husband wore his nuptial crown. Behold him to-day as wearing that
   crown still, for he is the same Christ, and do you go forth to meet
   him, and labor for him, and love him as the first saints did.

   Forget not that his mother is to crown him soon in the day of his
   espousals. He is our brother as well as our husband, and the Church is
   his mother as well as ours. Oh! she is to crown him soon! The day of
   his espousals draweth nigh. Hark! I hear the trumpet sound! Jesus
   comes, and his feet stand upon Mount Olivet; kings and princes lick the
   dust before him; he gathers sheaves of sceptres beneath his arm even as
   the mower gathereth wheat with the sickle. He treadeth on
   principalities and powers, the young lion and the dragon doth he
   trample under foot. And now his saints cry, "Hosanna, blessed is he
   that cometh in the name of the Lord." The long-expected one is come,
   and his mother crowns him in the day of his espousals! Courage, poor
   heart, courage! Go forth and see King Solomon to-day as he is to lie,
   and remember,

   "It doth not yet appear

   How great we shall be made;

   But when we see our Savior here,

   We shall be like our Head."

   When we look on Him; let us rejoice that this is to be our glory. We
   are to put off this sackcloth and put on scarlet and fine linen. The
   dust is to be wiped from our brow and the sweat from our face; the
   shackles are to be taken from our wrist, and the gyves from our legs;
   and we are to be emancipated, ennobled, glorified, made partners with
   Christ in all his splendor, and taught to reign with him world without
   end.

   But there are some here that I can hardly call the daughters of
   Jerusalem, yet they are always round about Zion's gate. Oh, there are
   many of you who are always listening to our voice, and joining in our
   hymns, and yet you have not seen our Master yet! Go forth; leave your
   sinful pleasures, and leave your self-righteousness too; go forth and
   behold King Solomon. Look to Jesus, sinner, bleeding on the cross, and
   as thou lookest, love and trust; and I know that as soon as thou hast
   seen him and trusted him, thou wilt have a crown to put upon his head.
   It will be the day of thine espousal unto him, and thou wilt crown him
   with such a crown. Thou wilt decorate that crown with jewels dug from
   the secret mine of thy deepest heart, and having made this crown, thou
   wilt put it on his head, and fall down before him and sing--

   "All hail the power of Jesu's name,

   Let angels prostrate fall;

   Bring forth the royal diadem,

   And crown him Lord of all."

   Well, then, we will lay aside every fear, and continue all the day
   gazing upon our matchless Christ, adoring him, exalting him, and having
   fellowship with him; for all is well; his travelling chariot is always
   safe, and soon will he step out of it with his bride at his right hand,
   and the world shall be astonished to behold the beauties of the royal
   pair when he shall be exalted, and they that are with him, before the
   presence of his Father and all the holy angels!

                             Life And Walk Of Faith

   SERMON DELIVERED ON SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7, 1862, BY REV. C. H.
   SPURGEON, AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walkyou in
   Him.
   Colossians 2:6.
   OUR nature is fond of change. Although man was made in the image of God
   at first, it is plain enough that any trace of immutability which he
   may once have possessed has long ago departed. Man, unrenewed, could he
   possess the joys of Heaven, would in time grow weary of them and crave
   for change. When the children of Israel in the wilderness were fed on
   angels' food, they murmured for variety and groaned out, "Our soul
   loathes this light bread." It is little wonder, then, that we need
   cautions against shifting the ground of our hope and the object of our
   faith.
   Another evil principle will work with this love of change in our hearts
   and produce much mischief--our natural tendency to build upon our own
   works. For a time that pernicious habit is cured by conviction of sin.
   The Law, with its sharp axe, cuts down the lofty cedar of fleshly
   confidence and withers all its verdure. But, since the root still
   remains, at the very scent of water it sprouts again and there is good
   need to set the axe going with all its former edge and weight. When we
   think legality quite dead, it revives, and, linking hands with our love
   of change, it tempts us to forsake our simple standing upon Christ, the
   Rock of Ages. It urges us to advance to a something which it decorates
   before our eyes with fancied colors and makes out, to our feeble
   understandings, to be better or more honorable to ourselves.
   Though this will certainly be again beaten down in a Christian, for he
   will meet with trouble after trouble when once he goes astray from his
   first path, yet again the old secret desire to be something, to do
   something, to have some little honor by performing the works of the
   Law, will come in and we shall have need to hear the voice of Wisdom in
   our hearts saying to us, "As you have received Christ Jesus the Lord,
   so walk you in Him." Persevere in the same way in which you have begun,
   and, as at the first, Christ Jesus was the source of your life, the
   principle of your action, and the joy of your spirit, so let Him be the
   same even till life's end--the same when you walk through the valley of
   the shadow of death and enter into the joy, and the rest, which remain
   for the people of God.
   In trying to teach this very useful, though simple lesson, I shall, in
   the plainest possible language, first of all talk a little of the text
   by way of exposition. Then, secondly, by way of advocacy. And then,
   thirdly, by way of application.
   I. Oh that the gracious Spirit, who alone can lead us into all the
   Truth of God, would aid me while I endeavor to open up this verse BY
   WAY OF EXPOSITION. In expounding the text, we readily break it up into
   two parts--here is the life of faith--receiving Christ Jesus the Lord.
   Here is, secondly, the walk of faith--so walk you in Him.
   1. The Holy Spirit here reveals to us the life of faith--the way by
   which you and I are saved, if saved at all. Mark, carefully, that it is
   represented as receiving. Now the word, "receiving," implies the very
   opposite of anything like merit. Merit is purchasing--merit might be
   called making by labor, or winning by valor. But receiving is just the
   accepting of a thing as a gift. The eternal life which God gives His
   people is in no sense whatever the fruit of their exertions. It is the
   gift of God. As the earth drinks in the rain, as the sea receives the
   streams, as night accepts light from the stars, so we, giving nothing,
   partake freely of the Grace of God.
   The saints are not, by nature, wells or streams. They are but cisterns
   into which the living water flows. They are but as the empty vessel.
   Sovereign mercy puts them under the pipe and they receive Divine Grace
   upon Divine Grace till they are filled to the brim. He that talks about
   winning salvation by works--he that thinks he can earn it by prayers,
   by tears, by penance, by mortification of the flesh, or by zealous
   obedience to the Law--makes a big mistake. For the very first principle
   of the Divine life is not giving out, but receiving. It is that which
   comes from Christ into me which is my salvation. Not that which springs
   out of my own heart, but that which comes from the Divine Redeemer, and
   changes, and renews my nature. It is not what I give out but what I
   receive, which must be life to me.
   The idea of receiving, again, seems to imply in it a sense of
   realization, making the matter a reality. One cannot very well receive
   a shadow. We receive that which is substantial. Gold, silver, precious
   stones--such things we can receive. Estates, riches, bread, water,
   food, raiment--all these are things which are substances to us, and
   therefore it becomes possible for us to receive them. We do not receive
   a dream. We do not receive, again, I say, a shadow. We do not speak of
   receiving a specter. We do not receive a phantom. There is something
   real in a thing that is received.
   Well now, so is it also in the life of faith. We realize Christ. While
   we are without faith, Christ is a name to us, a Person that may have
   lived a long while ago, so long that His life is only a history to us
   now! By an act of faith Christ becomes a real Person in the
   consciousness of our heart, as real to us as our own flesh, and blood,
   and bones--and we speak of Him and think of Him as we would of our
   brother, our father, our friend. Our faith gives a substance to the
   history and idea of Christ, puts real solidity into the spirit and name
   of Christ--and that which to the worldly man is but a phantom, a thing
   to hear about and talk about--becomes to us a thing to taste and
   handle, to lay hold upon and to receive as real and true.
   I know, you that are unconverted, think all these things an idle tale.
   But you that are saved, you who have received Christ--you know that
   there is substance here--and shadow everywhere else. This has become to
   you the one grand reality, that God is in Christ reconciling you unto
   Himself. But receiving means also a third thing, that is getting a grip
   of it, grasping it. The thing which I receive becomes my own. I may
   believe it to be real, but that is not receiving it. I may believe,
   also, that if I ever do get it, it must be given to me, and that I
   cannot earn it for myself. But still that is not receiving it.
   Receiving is the bona fide taking into my hands, and appropriating to
   myself as my own property that which is given to me.
   Now this is what the soul does when it believes on Christ. Christ
   becomes my Christ. His blood cleanses my sin, and it is cleansed. His
   righteousness covers me, and I am clothed with it. His Spirit fills me,
   and I am made to live by it. He becomes to me as much mine as anything
   that I can call my own. No, what I call my own here on earth is not
   mine. It is only lent to me, and will be taken from me. But Christ is
   so mine, that neither life, nor death, nor things present, nor things
   to come, shall ever be able to rob me of Him. Oh, I hope, dear Friends,
   you have that blessed appropriating faith which says, "Yes, He is not
   another man's Christ, He is my Christ," I hope you can look into His
   face today and say, "My Beloved, who loved me and gave Himself for me."

   I hope you do not talk of these things as I might talk of my lord
   So-and-So's park, and admire its beauties, while I, myself, have no
   right to one acre of the many thousands within the fence. But I trust,
   on the other hand, you can say-- "The blessings and promises of the
   Lord, my God, are all my own. Whatever I read of in the Covenant of
   Grace that is good, that is comely, that is desirable, I have heard a
   voice say in my ears, "Lift up now your eyes and look to the north and
   the south, to the east and the west: all this have I given you to be
   your possession forever and ever by a covenant of salt."

   Now put these three things together and I think your have the idea of
   receiving Christ. To receive Him is to have Him as the result of God's
   free gift. To realize Him. And then to appropriate Him to yourselves.
   The word "receive" is used in some ten or a dozen senses in Holy
   Scripture. Five of them will suffice my purpose just now. To receive is
   often used for taking. We read of receiving a thousand shekels of
   silver, and of receiving money, garments, sheep and oxen. Perhaps in
   this sense we understand the words of the Master--"No man can receive
   anything unless it is given him from above." And that other
   sentence--"To as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become
   the sons of God."

   We take Christ into us--to return to my old simile--as the empty vessel
   takes in water from the stream--so we receive Christ. The love, life,
   merit, nature, and Grace of Jesus freely flow into us, as the oil into
   the widow's vessels. But the word is also used in Scripture to signify
   holding that which we take in. Indeed, a vessel without a bottom could
   hardly be said to receive water. I do not suppose anyone would talk of
   a sieve receiving water except in a mock sense. But the life of faith
   consists in holding within us that which Christ has put into us, so
   that Jesus Christ is formed in us the hope of glory. By faith it comes
   in. By faith it is kept in. Faith gives me what I have, keeps what I
   have. Faith makes it mine, faith keeps it mine. Faith gets hold of it
   with one hand, and then clasps it with both hands with a grasp that
   neither death nor life can loose.

   Then, receiving sometimes means in Scripture simply believing. "He came
   unto His own and His own received Him not." We read of receiving false
   prophets, that is, believing them. Now, to receive Christ is to believe
   Him. He says, "I can save you." I receive that. He says, "I will save
   you." I receive that. He says, "Trust Me and I will make you like
   Myself." I receive that. Whatever Jesus says, I believe Him, and
   receive Him as true. I make His words so true to myself that I act upon
   them as being true, and regard them not as a word that may possibly be
   true but which must be true, even if Heaven and earth should pass away.
   This is receiving Christ--believing what He has said.

   Receiving, also, often signifies in Scripture entertaining. Thus the
   barbarous people at Melita received Paul and his companions kindly and
   kindled a fire. Ah, after we have once found all in Christ to be our
   own and have received Him into ourselves by faith, then we entreat the
   Lord to enter our hearts and sup with us. We give Him the best seat at
   the table of our souls. We would feast Him on the richest dainties of
   our choicest love. We ask Him to abide with us from morn till eve. We
   would commune with Him every day and every hour of the day. We
   entertain Him. We have a reception chamber in our hearts and we receive
   Christ.

   And then, once again, receiving in Scripture often signifies to enjoy.
   We hear of receiving a crown of life which fades not away. That is,
   enjoying it, enjoying Heaven, and being satisfied with all its bliss.
   Now, dear Friends, when we receive Christ, there is intended in this an
   enjoying of it. I am only now talking the simplicities of our faith,
   but I do want to make them very personal to you. Are you thus enjoying
   Christ? If you had a crown you would wear it. You have a Christ--feed
   on Him. If you were hungry and there was bread on the table, you would
   eat. Oh, eat and drink, Beloved, of your Lord Jesus Christ! If you have
   a friend, you enjoy his company--you have a Friend in Christ. Oh, enjoy
   His conversation! Do not leave Him, like a bottle of cordial for the
   fainting, sealed up from us.

   Let him not be as some choice dainty all untasted, while you are
   hungry. Oh, receive Christ, for this is the very Heaven and rest of the
   soul. His flesh is meat, indeed. His blood is drink, indeed. Never did
   angels taste such Divine fare. Come here, Saints, and satisfy
   yourselves in Him. To take Him into one's self, to hold Him there, to
   believe every word He says, to entertain Him in our hearts, and to
   enjoy the luscious sweetness which He must confer upon all those who
   have eaten His flesh and have been made to drink of His blood--this it
   is, to receive Christ.

   But we have not brought out the real meaning of this life of faith yet
   till we dwell upon another word. As you have received. Received what?
   Salvation may be described as the blind receiving sight, the deaf
   receiving hearing, the dead receiving life. But Beloved, Beloved, here
   is a thought here--oh that you may get hold of it! We have not only
   received these things but we have received CHRIST. "As you have
   received Christ Jesus the Lord." Do you see it? It is true that He gave
   us life from the dead. He gave us pardon of sin. He gave us imputed
   righteousness. These are all precious things-- but do you see we are
   not content with them?

   We have received Christ Himself!! The Son of God has been poured out
   into us, and we have received Him, and appropriated Him. Mark, I say,
   not merely the blessings of the Covenant, but Himself! Not merely the
   purchase of His blood, but He Himself, from whose veins the blood has
   flowed, has become ours. And every soul that has eternal life is this
   day a possessor of Christ Jesus the Lord. Now we will put this, also,
   personally to you. Have I received Christ, that is the Anointed? My
   soul, have you seen Christ as the Anointed of the Father in the Divine
   decree to execute His purposes? Have you seen Him coming forth in the
   fullness of time wearing the robes of His priesthood, the Anointed of
   the Father?

   Have you seen Him standing at the altar offering Himself as a Victim,
   an anointed Priest, anointed with the sacred oil by which God has made
   Him a Priest forever after the order of Melchisedek? My Soul, have you
   seen Jesus going within the veil and speaking to Your Father and to His
   Father as One whom the Father has accepted, of whom we can speak, in
   the language of David, as our shield and God's Anointed? Oh, it is a
   delight, indeed, to receive Christ not as an unsent Prophet, not as a
   man who came of His own authority, not as a teacher who spoke His own
   words, but as One who is Christos, the Anointed, the Anointed of God,
   ordained of the Most High, and therefore most certainly acceptable!

   As it is written, "/have laid help upon One that is mighty, I have
   exalted One chosen out of the people. It pleased the Father to bruise
   Him, He has put Him to grief." Delightful is the contemplation of
   Christ under that aspect! Soul, do you thus receive the Messiah of God?
   But the text says," Christ Jesus." Now Jesus means a Savior. Christ is
   His relation to God, Jesus His relation to me. Have I received Christ
   in His relationship to me as a Savior? My Soul, has Christ saved you?
   Come, no "ifs" and "ands" about it. Have you received Him as your
   Savior? Could you say in that happy day when your faith closed with
   Him, "Yes, Jesus, You have saved me"?

   Oh, there are some professors of religion who do not seem to have
   received Christ as Jesus. They look upon Him as One who may help them
   to save themselves, who can do a great deal for them, or may begin the
   work, but not complete it.

   Oh, Beloved, we must get a hold of Him as one that has saved us, that
   has finished the work. What? Don't you know that you are this day
   whiter than the driven snow because His blood has washed you? You are
   this day more acceptable to God than unfallen angels ever were, for you
   are clothed in the perfect righteousness of the Divine One. Christ has
   wrapped you about with His own righteousness. You are saved! You have
   received Him as God's Anointed. See that you receive Him as Jesus, your
   Savior.

   Then, again, it is clear that saving faith consists also in receiving
   Him as He is in Himself, as the Divine Son. "You have received Christ
   Jesus the Lord." Those who they say cannot believe in His Deity have
   not received Him. Others theoretically admit Him to be Divine, but He
   is never a subject of confidence as such. They have not received Him.
   But I trust I speak to many hundreds this morning who willingly accept
   His Godhead and say, "I entertain no doubt about His Deity and,
   moreover, on that I risk my soul. I do take Him into my heart as being
   God over all, blessed forever, Amen. I kiss His feet while I see His
   humanity. But I believe that, since those feet could tread the waters,
   He is Divine.

   "I look up to His hands, and as I see them pierced I know that He is
   human. But as I know that those hands multiplied the loaves and fishes
   till they fed five thousand, I know that He is Divine. I look upon His
   corpse in the tomb, and I see that He is Man. I see Him in the
   resurrection, and I know that He is God. I see Him on the Cross,
   suffering, and I know that He is bone of my bone, and flesh of my
   flesh. But I hear a voice which says, 'Let all the angels of God
   worship Him.' 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.' And I bow
   before Him and say, 'Oh Lord, You Son of God, and son of Mary, I
   receive You as Christ Jesus the Lord.' "

   Now this is all very plain talking, you will say. And I remind you that
   souls are saved by very plain truths, and the dealings of men's souls
   with Christ are not carried on in learned or metaphysical terms. We do
   believe, and so take Christ Jesus the Lord into us, and by that act of
   faith, without any doing of our own, we are completely saved.

   I shall only make this further remark here, that the Apostle speaks of
   this as a matter of certainty and goes on to argue from it. Now we do
   not argue from a supposition. I must have you clear, dearly Beloved in
   the Lord, that this is a matter of certainty to you. We can hardly get
   to the next point unless you can say, "I have received Jesus." The
   verse runs, "As, or since, you have received Christ Jesus the Lord so
   walk you in Him." We must not alter it into, "Since I hope I have,"
   "Since I trust I have." You either have or have not.

   If you have not, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God and cry
   to Him for His great gift. But if you have, O, dear Friends, do not let
   it be a question with you, but say, "Yes, yes, yes, I can say, once and
   for all, I have received Him. Poor, weak, and worthless though I am, I
   do put my humble seal to the fact that God is true, and I trust in Him
   who is able to save unto the uttermost them that come unto God by Him."
   This is the life of faith.

   2. Now, in expounding the text, our second point was the walk of faith.
   "Since you have received Him, walk in Him." Walk implies, first of all,
   action. Do not let your reception of Christ be a mere thing of thought
   to you, a subject only for your chamber, and your closet--but act upon
   it all. If you have really received Christ, and are saved, act as if
   you were saved--with joy, with meekness, with confidence, with faith,
   with boldness. Walk in Him--do not sit down in indo-lence--but rise and
   act in Him. Walk in Him. Carry out into practical effect that which you
   believe.

   See a man who has received an immense fortune, his purse is bursting,
   and his caskets are heavy. What does he do? Why, he behaves like a rich
   man. He sees a luxury which pleases him, and he buys it. There is an
   estate he desires, and he purchases it. He acts like a rich man.
   Beloved Brethren, you have received Christ--act upon it. Do not play
   the beggar, now that boundless wealth is conferred upon you!

   Walking, again, implies perseverance. Not only being in Christ
   today--that would be standing in Him and falling from Him. But being in
   Him tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, and the next, and the
   next--walking in Him all your walk of life. I remember Matthew Henry,
   speaking about Enoch walking with God, says he did not only take a turn
   or two up and down with God, and then leave Him, but he walked with God
   four hundred years. This implies perseverance. You have received
   Christ--persevere in receiving Him. You have come to trust Him--keep on
   trusting Him. You hang about His neck as a poor, helpless
   sinner--remain hanging there. In other words, abide in Him.

   Walking implies habit. When we speak of a man's walk and conversation,
   we mean his habits, the constant tenor of his life. Now, dear Friends,
   if you and I sometimes enjoy Christ, and then forget Him, if sometimes
   we say He is ours and soon loose our hold, that is not a habit. We do
   not walk in Him. But if you have received Him, let it be your habit to
   live upon Him, keep to Him--cling to Him, never let Him go--live and
   have your being in Him. This walking implies a con- tinuance. There is
   no notice given in the text of the suspension of this walking, but
   there must be a continual abiding in Christ. How many Christians there
   are who think that in the morning and evening they ought to come into
   the company of Christ, but then they may be in the world the rest of
   the day?

   Ah, but we ought always to be in Christ, that is to say, all the day
   long, every minute of the day. Though worldly things may take up some
   of my thoughts, yet my soul is to be in a constant state of being in
   Christ, so that if I am caught at any moment, I am in Him. At any hour,
   if anyone should say to me, "Now, are you saved?" I may be able still
   to say, "Yes." And if they ask me for an evidence of it, I may, without
   saying so, prove it to them by the fact that I am acting like a man who
   is in Christ, who has Christ in him, has had his nature changed by
   receiving Christ's nature, and has Christ to be his one end and aim. I
   suppose, also, that walking signifies progress. So walk in him--proceed
   from Divine Grace to Grace--run forward until you reach the uttermost
   limit of knowledge that man can have concerning our Beloved. "As you
   have received Him walk in Him."

   But now I want you to notice just this. It says, "Walk you in Him." Oh,
   I cannot attempt to enter into the mystery of this text--"Walk in Him!"
   You know if a man has to cross a river, he fords it quickly and is out
   of it again at once. But you are to suppose a person walking in a
   certain element always, in Christ. Just as we walk in the air, so am I
   to walk in Christ. Not sometimes, now and then coming to Him and going
   away from Him, but walking in Him as my element. Can you comprehend
   that? Not a soul here can make anything out of that but the most silly
   jargon, except the man who, having received the inner spiritual life,
   understands what it is to have fellowship with the Father and with His
   Son, Jesus Christ.

   Dear Friends, in trying to open up that point just for a moment, let us
   notice what this walking in Christ must mean. As Christ was at first
   when we received Him the only ground of our faith--so as long as we
   live, we are to stand to the same point. Did you not sing the other day
   when you first came to Him--

   "I'm a poor sinner and nothing at all,
   But Jesus Christ is my All in All"? Well, that is how you are to
   continue to the end. We commence our faith with--
   "Nothing in my hands I bring,
   Simply to the Cross I cling."

   When you are old with honors, when you are covered with fame, when you
   have served your Master well, still come in just the same way with--

   "A guilty weak and helpless worm, On Christ's kind arms I fall, He is
   my strength and righteousness, My Jesus and my All"

   Let not your experience, your sanctification, your graces, your
   attainments, come in between you and Christ. But just as you took Him
   to be the only pillar of your hope at first, so let Him be even to the
   last.

   You received Christ, again, as the substance of your faith. The infidel
   laughed at you, and said you had nothing to trust to. But your faith
   made Christ real to you. Well, now, just as the first day when you came
   to Jesus you no more doubted the reality of Christ than you did your
   own existence, so walk in Him. Well can I remember that first moment
   when these eyes looked to Christ! Ah, there was never anything so true
   to me as those bleeding hands, and that crown of thorns on His head. I
   wish it were always so, and indeed, it ought to be. As you have
   received Christ really, so keep on realizing and finding substance in
   Him.

   And remember that day, Beloved, when Christ became to us the joy of our
   souls? Home, friends, health, wealth, comforts--all lost their luster
   that day when He appeared, just as stars are hidden by the light of the
   sun. He was the only Lord and giver of life's best bliss, the one well
   of living water springing up unto everlasting life. I know that the
   first day it mattered not to me whether the day itself was gloomy or
   bright. I had found Christ! That was enough for me. He was my Savior.
   He was my All. I do think that that day I could have stood upon the
   fire wood of Smithfield to burn for Him readily enough.

   Well now, just as you received Him at first as your only joy, so
   receive Him still, walking in Him, making Him the source, the center,
   yes, and the circumference, too, of all your souls' range of delight,
   having your all in Him. So, Beloved, that day when we received Him, we
   received Him as the object of our love. Oh, how we loved Christ then!
   Had we met Him that day, we would have broken the alabaster box of
   precious ointment, and poured it upon His head. We would have washed
   His feet with our tears, and wiped them with the hairs of our head.

   Ah, Jesus, when I first received You, I thought I should have behaved
   far better than I have. I thought I would spend, and be spent for You,
   and should never dishonor You or turn aside from my faith and
   devotedness and zeal. But ah, Brethren, we have not come up to the
   standard of our text--walking in Him as we have received Him. He has
   not been by us so well beloved as we dreamed He would have been. I take
   it, then, to be the meaning of our text, as Christ Jesus the Lord was
   at the first All in All to you, so let Him be while life shall last.

   II. I shall be very brief upon THE ADVOCACY OF THIS PRINCIPLE, for
   surely you need no urgent persuasion to cleave unto such a Lord as
   yours. In advocating this principle, I would say, first of all,
   suppose, my Brethren, you and I, having been saved by Christ, should
   now begin to walk in someone else, what then? Why, what dishonor to our
   Lord! Here is a man who came to Christ and says he found salvation in
   Him. But after relying upon the Lord some half-a-dozen years, he came
   to find it was not a proper principle, and so now he has begun to walk
   by feelings, to walk by sight, to walk by philosophy, to walk by carnal
   wisdom. If such a case could be found, what discredit would it bring
   upon our Holy Leader and Captain!

   But I am certain no such instance will be found in you, if you have
   tasted that the Lord is gracious. Have you not up till now found your
   Lord to be a compassionate and generous Friend to you, and has not
   simple faith in Him given you all the peace your spirit could desire? I
   pray you, then, unless you would stain His glory in the dust, as you
   have received Christ, so walk in Him.

   Besides, what reason have you to make a change? Has there been any
   argument in the past? Has not Christ proved Himself all-sufficient! He
   appeals to you today--"Have I been a wilderness unto you?" When your
   soul has simply trusted Christ, have you ever been confounded? When you
   have dared to come as a guilty sinner, and believed in Him, have you
   ever been ashamed? Very well, then, let the past urge you to walk in
   Him. And as for the present, can that compel you to leave Christ? Oh,
   when we are hard beset with this world or with the severer trials
   within the Church, we find it such a sweet thing to come back! Pillow
   our head upon the bosom of our Savior. This is the joy we have
   today--that if we are in trial--we are saved in Him. And if we find
   this today to be enough, why should we think of changing!

   I will not forswear the sunlight till I find a better, nor leave my
   Lord until a brighter Lover shall appear. And, since this can never be,
   I will hold Him with a grasp immortal, and bind His name as a seal upon
   my arm. As for the future, can you suggest anything which can arise
   that shall render it necessary for you to tack about, or strike sail,
   or go with another captain in another ship? I think not. Suppose life
   to be long--He changes not. Suppose you die--is it not written that,
   "neither death, nor life, nor things present, nor things to come, shall
   be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
   our Lord"?

   You are poor. What better than to have Christ who can make you rich in
   faith? Suppose you are sick. What more do you want than Christ to make
   your bed in your sickness? Suppose you should be maltreated and mocked
   at, and slandered for His sake--what better do you want then to have
   Him as a Friend who sticks closer than a brother? In life, in death, in
   judgment--you cannot conceive anything that can arise in which you
   would require more than Christ bestows.

   But, dear Friends, it may be that you are tempted by something else to
   change your course for a time. Now what is it? Is it the wisdom of this
   world, the cunning devices and discoveries of man? Is it that which our
   Apostle mentions as philosophy? The wise men of the world have
   persuaded you to begin questioning. They have urged you to put the
   mysteries of God to the test of common sense, reason and so forth, as
   they call it, and not lean on the inspiration of God's Word. Ah, well,
   Beloved, it is wisdom, I suppose, which philosophy offers you. Well,
   but have you not that in Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of
   wisdom and knowledge? You received Christ at first, I thought, as being
   made of God unto you wisdom, and sanctification, and righteousness, and
   so on. Well, will you cast Him off when you have already more than all
   the wisdom which this philosophy offers?

   Is it ceremonies that tempt you? Has the priest told you that you ought
   to attend to these, and then you would have another ground of
   confidence? Well, but you have that in Christ. If there is anything in
   the circumcision of the Jews, you have that, for you are circumcised in
   Him. If there is anything in Baptism--as some think that to be a saving
   ordi-nance--you have been buried with Him in Baptism. You have that. Do
   you want life? Your life is hid with Him. Do you want death? You are
   dead with Christ, and buried with Him. Do you want resurrection? He has
   raised you up with Him. Do you want Heaven? He has make you sit
   together in heavenly places in Him.

   Getting Christ, you have all that everything else can offer you.
   Therefore be not tempted from this hope of your calling, but as you
   have received Christ, so walk in Him. And then, further, do you not
   know that your Jesus is the Lord from Heaven? What can your heart
   desire beyond God? God is infinite. You cannot want more than the
   infinite. "In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."
   Having Christ, you have God. And having God, you have everything. Well
   might the Apostle add to that sentence, "And you are complete in Him!"

   Well, then, if you are complete in Christ, why should you be beguiled
   by the bewitcheries of this world to want something besides Christ? If
   resting upon Him, God is absolutely yours, and you are, therefore, full
   to the brim with all that your largest capacity can desire, oh, why
   should you thus be led astray, like foolish children, to seek after
   another confidence and another trust? Oh, come back, you Wanderer! Come
   you back to this solid foundation and sing once again with us--

   "On Christ the solid rock I stand, All other ground is sinking sand."

   III. And now, last of all, a few words BY WAY OF APPLICATION "So walk
   you in Him." One of the first applications shall be made with regard to
   some who complain of a want of communion, or rather, of those of whom
   we ought to complain, since they injure us all by their distance from
   Christ.

   There are some of you who never have much communion with Christ. You
   are members of the Church and very decent people, I dare say, in your
   way. But you do not have communion with Christ. Ask some
   professors--"Do you ever have communion with Christ?" They would be
   obliged to say--"Well, I do not know that my life is inconsistent. I do
   not think anybody could blame me for any wrong act towards my fellow
   man. But if you come to that, whether I have ever had communion with
   Christ, I am compelled to say that I have had it now and then, but it
   is very seldom--it is like the angels' visits--few and far between."

   Now, Brethren, you have received Christ, have you not? Then the
   application of the principle is as you have received Him, so walk in
   Him. If it were worth while for you to come to Him at first, then it is
   worth while for you always to keep to Him. If it were really a safe
   thing for you to come to Him and say, "Jesus, you are the way," then it
   is a safe thing for you to do now. And if that were the foundation of
   blessedness to you, to come simply to Christ, then it will be the
   fountain of blessedness to you to do the same now. Come, then, to Him
   now.

   If you were foolish in trusting Him at the first, then you are wise in
   leaving off doing so now. If you were wise, however, in approaching to
   Christ years gone by, you are foolish in not standing by Christ now.
   Come, then, let the remembrance of your marriage unto the Lord Jesus
   rebuke you! And if you have lost your fellowship with Jesus, come again
   to His dear body wounded for your sake and say, "Lord Jesus, help me
   from this time forth as I have received You, day by day to walk in
   You."

   There are many of you who complain of a want of comfort. You are not so
   comfortable as you would like to be and why? Why, you have sinned. Yes,
   yes, but how did you receive Christ. As a saint? "No, no," you say, "I
   came to Christ as a sinner." Come to Him as a sinner now, then. "Oh,
   but I feel so guilty." Just so, but what was your hope at first? Why,
   that guilty though you were, He had made an atonement and you trusted
   in Him. Well, you are still guilty--do the same as you did at
   first--walk in Him, and I cannot imagine a person without comfort who
   continually makes this the strain of his life, to rest on Christ as a
   poor sinner, just as he did at first.

   Why, Lord, You know the devil often says to me, "You are no saint."
   Well, then, if I am not a saint, yet I am a sin-ner--and it is
   written--"Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners." Then--

   "Just as I am and waiting not,
   To rid my soul of one foul spot,
   To Him whose blood can cleanse each blot,
   O Lamb of God, I come, I come."

   Why, you cannot help having comfort if you walk with your Surety and
   Substitute as you did at the first, resting on Him and not in feelings,
   nor experience, nor graces, nor anything of your own--living and
   resting alone on Him who is made of God unto you all that your soul
   requires.

   There is yet another thing. There are many Christians whose lives
   really are not consistent. I cannot understand this if they are walking
   in Christ. In fact, if a man could completely walk in Christ, he would
   walk in perfect holiness. We hear an instance, perhaps, of a little
   shopkeeper who puffs and exaggerates as other shopkeepers do--he does
   not exactly tell a lie, but something very near it. Now I want to know
   whether that man was walking in Christ when he did that. If he had said
   to himself, "Now I am in Christ," do you think he would have done it?

   We hear of another who is constantly impatient, always troubled,
   fretting, mournful. I want to know whether that man is really walking
   in Christ as he walked at first, when he is doubting the goodness, the
   Providence, the tenderness of God. Surely he is not! I have heard of
   hard-hearted professors who take a Christian Brother by the throat
   with, "Pay me what you owe." Do you think they are walking in Christ
   when they do that? We hear of others, when their Brothers have need,
   shut up the heart of their compassion--are mean and stingy. Are they
   walking in Christ when they do that?

   Why, if a man walks in Christ, then he so acts as Christ would act. For
   Christ being in him, his hope, his love, his joy, his life--he is the
   reflex of the image of Christ. He is the glass into which Christ looks.
   And then the image of Christ is reflected, and men say of that man, "He
   is like his Master. He lives in Christ." Oh, I know, dear Brethren, if
   we lived now, as we did the first day we came to Christ, we should live
   very differently from what we do. How we felt towards Him that day! We
   would have given all we had for Him! How we felt towards sinners that
   day! Lad that I was, I wanted to preach and--

   "Tell to sinners round,
   What a dear Savior I had found."

   How we felt towards God that day! When we were on our knees, what
   pleading there was with Him! What a nearness of access to Him in
   prayer! Oh, how different! How different with some now! This world has
   with rude hands brushed the bloom from the young fruit. Is it true that
   flowers of Divine Grace, like the flowers of nature, die in the autumn
   of our piety? As we all get older, ought we to be more worldly? Should
   it be that our early love, which was the love of our espousals, dies
   away? Forgive, O Lord, this evil, and turn us anew unto You--

   "Return, O holy Dove! return,
   Sweet messenger of rest!
   We hate the sins that made You mourn,
   And drove You from our breast.
   The dearest idol we have known,
   Whatever that idol be,
   Help us to tear it from Your throne,
   And worship only You.
   So shall our walk be close with God,
   Calm and serene our frame--
   So purer light shall mark the road
   That leads us to the Lamb."

   "As you have received Him walk in Him," and if you have not received
   Him, oh, poor Sinner, remember He is free and full--full to give you
   all you need--and free to give it even to you. Let the verse we sung be
   an invitation to you--

   "This fountain, though rich, from charge is quite clear;
   The poorer the wretch, the more welcome here--
   Come, needy and guilty; come, loathsome and bare;
   Though leprous and filthy, come just as you are."

   Trust in God's anointed--that is receive Him--and then, having trusted
   Him, continue still to trust Him. May His Spirit enable you to do it
   and to His name shall be glory forever and ever.

                            The Lord,--the Liberator

   A Sermon

   (No. 484)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, December 14th, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "The Lord looseth the prisoners."--Psalm 146:7.

   WHEN PREACHING LAST TUESDAY in Dover, the mayor of the town very
   courteously lent the ancient town-hall for the service, and in passing
   along to reach a private entrance, I noticed a large number of grated
   windows upon a lower level than the great hall. These belonged to the
   prison cells where persons committed for offenses within the
   jurisdiction of the borough were confined. It at once struck me as a
   singular combination, that we should be preaching the gospel of liberty
   in the upper chamber, while there were prisoners of the law beneath us.
   Perhaps when we sang praises to God, the prisoners, like those who were
   in the same jail with Paul and Silas, heard us; but the free word above
   did not give them liberty, nor did the voice of song loose their bonds.
   Alas! what a picture is this of many in our congregations. We preach
   liberty to the captives; we proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord;
   but how many remain year after year in the bondage of Satan, slaves to
   sin. We send up our notes of praise right joyously to our Father who is
   in heaven, but our praises cannot give them joy, for alas! their hearts
   are unused to gratitude. Some of them are mourning on account of
   unpardoned sin, and others of them are deploring their blighted hopes,
   for they have looked for comfort where it is never to be found. Let us
   breathe a prayer at the commencement of the sermon this morning, "Lord,
   break the fetters, and set free the captives. Glorify thyself this
   morning by proving thyself to be Jehovah, who looseth the prisoners."

   The little circumstance which I have mentioned, fixed itself in my
   mind, and in my private meditations it thrust itself upon me. My
   thoughts ran somewhat in an allegory, until I gave imagination its full
   rein and bid her bear me at her will. In my day-dream I thought that
   some angelic warder was leading me along the corridors of this great
   world-prison, and bidding me look into the various cells where the
   prisoners were confined, reminding me ever and anon as I looked
   sorrowful, that "Jehovah looseth the prisoners." What I thought of, I
   will now tell out to you. The dress of the sermon may be metaphorical;
   but my only aim is to utter comforting, substantial truth, and may the
   Master grant that some of you who have been in these prisons, as I have
   been, may this day come out of them, and rejoice that the Lord has
   loosed you.

   I. The first cell to which I went, and to which I shall conduct you, is
   called the common prison. In this common prison, innumerable souls are
   shut up. It were useless to attempt to count them; they are legion;
   their number is ten thousand times ten thousand. This is the ward of
   SIN. All the human race have been prisoners here; and those who this
   day are perfectly at liberty, once wore the heavy chain, and were
   immured within the black walls of this enormous prison. I stepped into
   it, and to my surprise, instead of hearing, as I had expected, notes of
   mourning and lament, I heard loud and repeated bursts of laughter. The
   mirth was boisterous and obstreperous. The profane were cursing and
   blaspheming; others were shouting as though they had found great spoil.
   I looked into the faces of some of the criminals, and saw sparkling
   gaiety: their aspect was rather that of wedding-guests than prisoners.
   Walking to and fro, I noticed captives who boasted that they were free,
   and when I spoke to them of their prison-house, and urged them to
   escape, they resented my advice, saying, "We were born free, and were
   never in bondage unto any man." They bade me prove my words; and when I
   pointed to the irons on their wrists, they laughed at me, and said that
   these were ornaments which gave forth music as they moved; it was only
   my dull and sombre mind, they said, which made me talk of clanking
   fetters and jingling chains. There were men fettered hard and fast to
   foul and evil vices, and these called themselves free-livers, while
   others whose very thoughts were bound, for the iron had entered into
   their soul, with braggart looks, cried out to me, that they were
   freethinkers. Truly, I had never seen such bond-slaves in my life
   before, nor any so fast manacled as these; but ever did I mark as I
   walked this prison through and through, that the most fettered thought
   themselves the most free, and those who were in the darkest part of the
   dungeon, thought they had most light, and those whom I considered to be
   the most wretched, and the most to be pitied, were the very ones who
   laughed the most, and raved most madly and boisterously in their mirth.
   I looked with sorrow but as I looked, I saw a bright spirit touch a
   prisoner on the shoulder, who thereon withdrew with the shining one. He
   went out, and I knew, for I had read the text--"The Lord looseth the
   prisoners," I knew that the prisoner had been loosed from the house of
   bondage. But I noted that as he went forth his late bond-fellows
   laughed and pointed with the finger, and called him sniveller,
   hypocrite, mean pretender, and all ill names, until the prison walls
   rang and rang again with their mirthful contempt! I watched, and saw
   the mysterious visitant touch another, and then another, and another,
   and they disappeared. The common conversation of the prison said that
   they had gone mad; that they were become slaves, or miserable fanatics,
   whereas I knew that they were gone to be free for ever; emancipated
   from every bond. What struck me most was, that the prisoners who were
   touched with the finger of delivering love were frequently the worst of
   the whole crew. I marked one who had blasphemed, but the Divine hand
   touched him, and he went weeping out of the gate. I saw another who had
   often scoffed the loudest when he had seen others led away, but he went
   out as quietly as a lamb. I observed some, whom I thought to be the
   least depraved of them all, but they were left, and oftentimes the
   blackest sinners of the whole company were first taken, and I
   remembered that I had somewhere in an old book read these words--"The
   publicans and the harlots enter into the kingdom of God before you." As
   I gazed intently, I saw some of those men who had once been prisoners
   come back again into the prison--not in the same dress which they had
   worn before, but arrayed in white robes, looking like new creatures.
   They began to talk with their fellow prisoners; and, oh! how sweetly
   did they speak! They told them there was liberty to be had; that yonder
   door would open, and that they might escape. They pleaded with their
   fellow-men, even unto tears. I saw them sit down and talk with them
   till they wept upon their necks, urging them to escape, pleading as
   though it were their own life that was at stake. At first I hoped
   within myself that all the company of prisoners would rise and cry, Let
   us be free." But no; the more these men pleaded the harder the others
   seemed to grow, and, indeed, I found it so when I sought myself to be
   an ambassador to these slaves of sin. Wherever the finger of the
   shining one was felt our pleadings easily prevailed; but save and
   except in those who were thus touched by the heavenly messenger all our
   exhortations fell upon deaf ears, and we left that den of iniquity
   crying, "Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the
   Lord revealed?" Then I was cast into a muse, as I considered what a
   marvel of mercy it was that I myself should be free; for well do I
   remember when I spurned every invitation of love; when hugged my
   chains, dreamed my prison garb to be a royal robe, and took the meals
   of the prison, called the pleasures of sin, and relished them as sweet,
   yea, dainty morsels, fit for princes. How it came to pass that
   sovereign grace should have set me free I cannot tell; only this I
   know, I will sing for ever, while I live and when I die, that "The Lord
   looseth the prisoners." Our gracious God knoweth how to bring us up out
   from among the captives of sin, set our feet in the way of
   righteousness and liberty, make us his people, and keep us so for ever.
   Alas! how many have I now before me who are prisoners in this common
   prison?

   "Oh! sovereign grace, their hearts subdue;
   May they be freed from bondage too;
   As willing followers of the Lord,
   Brought forth to freedom by his word."

   II. I asked the guide where those were led who were released from the
   common ward. He told me that they were taken away to be free perfectly
   free; but that before their complete gaol deliverance it was necessary
   that they should visit a house of detention which he would show me. He
   led me thither. It was called the solitary cell. I had heard much of
   the solitary system, and I wished to look inside this cell, supposing
   that it would be a dreadful place. Over the door was written this
   word--"PENITENCE," and when I opened it I found it so clean and white,
   and withal so sweet and full of light, that I said this place was
   fitter to be a house of prayer than a prison, and my guide told me that
   indeed so it was originally intended, and that nothing but that iron
   door of unbelief which the prisoners would persist in shutting fast
   made it a prison at all. When once that door was open the place became
   so dear an oratory, that those who were once prisoners therein were
   wont to come back to the cell of their own accord, and begged leave to
   use it, not as a prison, but as a closet for prayer all their lives
   long. He even told me that one was heard to say when he was dying, that
   his only regret in dying was, that in heaven there would be no cell of
   penitence. Here David wrote seven of his sweetest Psalms; Peter also
   wept bitterly here; and the woman who was a sinner here washed the feet
   of her Lord. But this time I was regarding it as a prison, and I
   perceived that the person in the cell did so consider it. I found that
   every prisoner in this cell must be there alone. He had been accustomed
   to mix with the crowd, and find his comfort in the belief that he was a
   Christian because born in a Christian nation; but he learned that he
   must be saved alone if saved at all. He had been accustomed aforetime
   to go up to the house of God in company, and thought that going there
   was enough; but now every sermon seemed to be aimed at him, and every
   threatening smote his conscience. I remembered to have read a passage
   in the same old book I quoted just now--"I will pour out upon the house
   of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace
   and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have
   pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only
   son, and shall be in bitterness for his, as one that is in bitterness
   for his firstborn. And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the
   family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family
   of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; the family of the
   house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart,
   and their wives apart; all the families that remain, every family
   apart, and their wives apart." I noticed that the penitent, while thus
   alone and apart in his cell, sighed and groaned full oft, and now and
   then mingled with his penitential utterances some words of unbelief.
   Alas! were it not for these, that heavy door would long ago have been
   taken from its hinges. 'Twas unbelief that shut the prisoners in, and
   if unbelief had been removed from this cell I say it had been an
   oratory for heaven, and not a place for disconsolate mourning and
   lamentation. As the prisoner wept for the past, he prophecied for the
   future, and groaned that he should never come out of this confinement,
   because sin had ruined him utterly, and destroyed his soul eternally.
   How foolish his fears were all men might see, for as I looked round
   upon this clean and white cell, I saw that the door had a knocker
   inside, and that if the man had but the courage to lift it there was a
   shining one standing ready outside who would open the door at once;
   yea, more, I perceived that there was a secret spring called faith, and
   if the man could but touch it, though it were but with a trembling
   finger, it would make the door fly open. Then I noticed that this door
   had on the lintel and on the two side posts thereof the marks of blood,
   and any man who looked on that blood, or lifted that knocker, or
   touched that spring, found the door of unbelief fly open, and he came
   out from the cell of his solitary pentitence to rejoice in the Lord who
   had put away his sin, and cleansed him for ever from all iniquity. So I
   spoke to this penitent, and bade him trust in the blood, and it may be
   that through my words the Lord afterwards loosed the prisoner; but this
   I learned, that no words of mine alone could do it, for in this case,
   even where repentance was mingled with but a little unbelief, 'tis the
   Lord, the Lord alone, who can loose the prisoners.

   III. I passed away from that cell, though I would have been content to
   linger there, and I halted at another; this, also, had an iron gate of
   unbelief, as heavy and as ponderous as the former. I heard the warder
   coming, and when he opened the door for me it grated horribly upon its
   hinges, and disturbed the silence, for this time I was come into the
   silent cell. The wretch confined here was one who said he could not
   pray. If he could pray he would be free. He was groaning, crying,
   sighing, weeping because he could not pray. All he could tell me, as
   his eyeballs rolled in agony, was this--"I would, but cannot, pray; I
   would plead with God, but I cannot find a word, my guilt has smitten me
   dumb." Back he went, and refused to speak again, but he kept up a
   melancholy roaring all the day long. In this place no sound was heard
   but that of wailing; all was hushed except the dropping of his tears
   upon the cold stone, and his dreary miserere of sighs and groans.
   Verily thought I this is a sad and singular case, yet I remember when I
   was in that cell myself I did not think it strange. I thought that the
   heavens were brass above me, and that if I cried never so earnestly the
   Lord would shut out my prayer. I durst not pray, I was too guilty, and
   when I did dare to pray 'twas hardly prayer, for I had no hope of being
   heard. "No," I said, "it is presumption; I must not plead with him;"
   and when at times I would have prayed, I could not; something choked
   all utterance, and the spirit could only lament, and long, and pant,
   and sigh to be able to pray. I know that some of you have been in this
   prison, and while I am talking to you this morning you will remember
   it, and bless God for deliverance. Perhaps some of you are in it now,
   and though I say I think your case is very strange, it will not seem so
   to you. But do you know, there was a little table in this cell, and on
   the table lay a key of promise, inscribed with choice words. I am sure
   the key would unlock the prison-door, and if the prisoner had possessed
   skill to use it; he might have made his escape at once. This was the
   key, and these were the words thereon--"The Lord looked down from the
   height of his sanctuary: from heaven did the Lord behold the earth, to
   hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to
   death." Now, thought I, if this man cannot speak, yet God hears his
   groans; if he cannot plead, God listens to his sighs, and beholds him
   all the way from heaven, with this purpose, that he may catch even the
   faintest whisper of this poor man's broken heart and set him free; for
   though the soul feels it can neither plead nor pray, yet it has prayed,
   and it shall prevail. I tried to catch the ear of my poor friend a
   little while, and I talked to him, though he would not speak with me. I
   reminded him that the book in his cell contained instances of dumb men
   whom Jesus had taught to speak, and I told him that Christ was able to
   make him speak plainly too. I turned to the book of Jonah, and read him
   these words,--"Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest me."

   I quoted the words of Elias, "Go again seven times." I told him that
   the Lord needed no fine language, for misery is the best argument for
   mercy, and our wounds the best mouths to speak to God's ear. Besides, I
   told him we have an Advocate with the Father who openeth his mouth for
   the dumb, so that those who cannot speak for themselves have one to
   speak for them. I told the man that whether he could pray or not he was
   bidden to look at the blood-marks over his door; that the publican was
   justified by the blood, though he could only cry "God, be merciful to
   me, a sinner." I pleaded with him to receive the Lord's own testimony,
   that the Lord Jesus is "able to save unto the uttermost them that come
   unto God by him," that he waited to be gracious, and was a God ready to
   pardon; but after all, I felt that the Lord alone must loose his
   prisoners. O, gracious God, loose them now!

   IV. We had not time to stay long at any one place, so we hastened to a
   fourth door. The door opened and shut behind me and I stood alone. What
   did I see? I saw nothing! 'Twas dark, dark as Egypt in her plague! This
   was the black hole called the cell of ignorance. I groped as a blind
   man gropeth for the wall. I was guided by my ear by sobs and moans to a
   spot where there knelt a creature in an earnest agony of prayer. I
   asked him what made his cell so dark. I knew the door was made of
   unbelief, which surely shuts out all light, but I marvelled why this
   place should be darker than the rest, only I recollected to have read
   of some that sat "in darkness, and in the shadow of death, being bound
   in affliction and iron." I asked him if there were no windows to the
   cell. Yes, there were windows, many windows, so people told him, but
   they had been stopped up years ago, and he did not know the way to open
   them. He was fully convinced that they never could afford light to him.
   I felt for one of the ancient lightholes, but it seemed as if, instead
   of giving light, it emitted darkness; I touched it with my hand and it
   felt to me to have once been a window such as I had gazed through with
   delight. He told me it was one of the doctrines of grace which had
   greatly perplexed him; it was called Election. He said he should have
   had a little light had it not been for that doctrine, but since God had
   chosen his people, and he felt persuaded that he had not chosen him, he
   was lost for ever, since if he were not chosen, it was hopeless for him
   to seek for mercy. I went up to that window and pulled out some
   handfuls of rags; filthy rotten rags which some enemies of the doctrine
   had stuffed into the opening; caricatures and misrepresentations of the
   doctrine maliciously used to injure the glorious truth of divine
   sovereignty. As I pulled out these rags, light streamed in, and the man
   smiled as I told him, "It is a mercy for thee that there is such a
   doctrine as election, for if there were no such doctrine, there would
   be no hope for thee; salvation must either be by God's will or by man's
   merit; if it were by man's merit, thou wouldest never be saved, but
   since it is by God's will, and he will have mercy on whom he will have
   mercy, there is no reason why he should not have mercy on thee, even
   though thou mayest be the chief of sinners. Meanwhile he bids thee
   believe in his Son Jesus, and gives thee his divine word for it, that
   "Him that cometh unto him he will in no wise cast out." The little
   light thus shed upon the poor man led him to seek for more, so he
   pointed to another darkened window which was called--The Fall--or Human
   Depravity. The man said, "Oh, there is no hope for me for I am totally
   depraved, and my nature is exceeding vile; there is no hope for me." I
   pulled the rags out of this window too, and I said to him, "Do you not
   see that your ruin fits you for the remedy? It is because you are lost
   that Christ came to save you. Physicians are for the sick, robes for
   the naked, cleansing for the filthy, and forgiveness for the guilty."
   He said but little, but he pointed to another window, which was one I
   had long looked through and seen my Master's glory by its means; it was
   the doctrine of Particular Redemption. "Ah!" said he, "suppose Christ
   has not redeemed me with his precious blood! Suppose he has never
   bought me with his death!" I knocked out some old bricks which had been
   put in by an unskilful hand, which yet blocked out the light, and I
   told him that Christ did not offer a mock redemption, but one which did
   really redeem, for "the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanseth us
   from all sin." "Ah!" he said, "but suppose I am not one of the 'us!'" I
   told him that he that believeth and trusteth Christ, is manifestly one
   of those whom Jesus came to save, for he is saved. I told him that
   inasmuch as universal redemption manifestly does not redeem all, it was
   unworthy of his confidence; but a ransom which did redeem all
   believers, who are the only persons for whom it was presented, was a
   sure ground to build upon. There were other doctrines like these. I
   found the man did not understand one of them; that the truth had been
   misrepresented to him, and he had heard the doctrines of grace falsely
   stated and caricatured, or else had never heard them at all. He had
   been led by some blind guide who had led him into the ditch, and now
   when the windows were opened and the man could see, he saw written over
   the door, "Believe and live!" and in the new light which he had found
   he trusted his Lord and Savior, and walked out free, and marvelled that
   he had been so long a slave. I marvelled not, but I thought in my heart
   how accursed are those teachers who hide the light from the eyes of men
   so that they understand not the way of life. Ignorant souls, who know
   not the plan of salvation, will have many sorrows, which they might
   escape by instruction. Study your Bibles well; be diligent in attending
   upon a free-grace ministry; labor after a clear apprehension of the
   plan of salvation, and it will often please God that when you come to
   understand his truth your spirits will receive comfort, for it is by
   the truth that "the Lord looseth the prisoners."

   V. I passed on and came to another chamber. This room, marked number
   five, was large, and had many persons in it who were trying to walk to
   and fro, but every man had a chain round his ankle, and a huge
   cannon-ball fixed to it-a military punishment they said for deserters
   from the ranks of virtue. This clog of habit troubled the prisoner
   much. I saw some of them trying to file their chains with rusty nails,
   and others were endeavoring to fret away the iron by dropping tears of
   penitence thereon; but these poor men made but little progress at their
   work. The warder told me that this was the chain of Habit, and that the
   ball which dragged behind was the old propensity to lust and sin. I
   asked him why they did not get the chains knocked off, and he said they
   had been trying a long time to be rid of them, but they never could do
   it in the way they went to work, since the proper way to get rid of the
   chain of habit was, first of all, to get out of prison; the door of
   unbelief must be opened, and they must trust in the one great deliverer
   the Lord Jesus, whose pierced hands could open all prison doors; after
   that, upon the anvil of grace with the hammer of love, their fetters
   could be broken off. I stayed awhile, and I saw a drunkard led out of
   his prison, rejoicing in pardoning grace. He had aforetime labored to
   escape from his drunkenness, but some three or four times he broke his
   pledge, and went back to his old sin. I saw that man trust in the
   precious blood and he became a Christian, and becoming a Christian he
   could no more love his cups; at one stroke of the hammer the ball was
   gone for ever. Another was a swearer; he knew it was wrong to blaspheme
   the Most High, but he did it still, till he gave his heart to Christ,
   and then he never blasphemed again, for that foul thing was abhorred. I
   noticed some, and methinks I am one of them myself, although they had
   the ball taken away, yet on their hands there were the remains of old
   chains. Like Paul, in another case, when we rejoice in all things we
   have to say, "Except these bonds." Once we were chained both hands
   together; the divine hammer has smitten off the connecting links, but
   still some one or two are left hanging there. Ah! often has that link
   made me cry out--"O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from
   the body of this death!" Though I am free, yet still the iron clings to
   its hold, and will hang there till I die. "When I would do good evil is
   present with me." O that old Adam nature, the corrupt flesh, would God
   we were rid of it! Blessed be the Lord, as the pulse begins to beat
   high with heaven's glory, the band will burst, and we shall be perfect
   for ever. There is no way of getting rid of the links of old habits but
   by leaving the prison of unbelief and coming to Christ, then the evil
   habits are renounced as a necessary consequence though the temptation
   will remain. Though sometimes we have to feel a link of the chain, it
   is a subject of unbounded thankfulness that the link is not fastened to
   the staple. We may sometimes feel it dragging behind, enough to trip us
   up, so that we cannot run in the path of obedience as swiftly as we
   would, but it is not in the staple now. The bird can fiy; though there
   be a remnant of its cord about its foot it mounts up to heaven, singing
   its song of praise. The Lord must loose prisoners from their evil
   habits. He can do it; a drop of Jesu's blood can eat the iron all away,
   and the file of his agonies can cut through the chain of long-acquired
   sins, and make us free. "The Lord looseth the prisoners."

   VI. I must take you to another cell. In almost all prisons where they
   do not want to make vagabonds worse than when they entered, they have
   hard labor for them. In the prison I went to see in my reverie there
   was a hard-labor room. Those who entered it were mostly very proud
   people; they held their heads very high, and would not bend; they were
   birds with fine feathers, and thought themselves quite unfit to be
   confined, but being in durance vile, they resolved to work their own
   way out. They believed in the system of human merit, and hoped in due
   time to purchase their liberty. They had saved up a few old counterfeit
   farthings, with which they thought they could by-and-bye set themselves
   free, though my bright attendant plainly declared their folly and
   mistake. It was amusing, and yet sad, to see what different works these
   people were about. Some of them toiled at a tread-wheel; they were
   going to the stars they said, and there they were, tread, tread, tread,
   with all their might; but though they had been laboring for years, and
   were never an inch higher, yet still they were confident that they were
   mounting to the skies. Others were trying to make garments out of
   cobwebs; they were turning wheels, and spinning at a great rate, and
   though it came to nothing they wrought on. They believed they should be
   free as soon as they had made a perfect garment, and I believe they
   will. In one place a company labored to build houses of sand, and when
   they had built up to some height the foundation always yielded, but
   they renewed their efforts, for they dreamed that if a substantial
   edifice were finished they would then be allowed to go free. I saw some
   of them, strangely enough, endeavoring to make wedding garments out of
   fig-leaves, by sewing them together, but the fig-leaves were of a sort
   that were shrivelled every night, so that they had to begin the next
   morning their hopeless toil. Some, I noticed, were trying to pump water
   out of a dry well, the veins stood out upon their brows like whipcords
   while they worked amain without result. As they labored, like Samson
   when he was grinding at the mill, I could hear the crack of whips upon
   their backs. I saw one ten-thonged whip called the Law, the terrible
   Law--each lash being a commandment, and this was laid upon the bare
   backs and consciences of the prisoners; yet still they kept on work,
   work, work, and would not turn to the door of grace to find escape. I
   saw some of them fall down fainting, whereupon their friends strove to
   bring them water in leaking vessels, called ceremonies; and there were
   some men called priests, who ran about with cups which had no bottoms
   in them, which they held up to the lips of these poor fainting wretches
   to give them comfort. As these men fainted, I thought they would die,
   but they struggled up again to work. At last they could do no more, and
   fell down under their burdens utterly broken in spirit; then I saw that
   every prisoner who at last so fainted as to give up all hope of his own
   deliverance by merit, was taken up by a shining spirit, and carried out
   of the prison and made free for ever. Then I thought within myself,
   'Surely, surely, these are proud self-righteons persons who will not
   submit to be saved by grace, therefore He brought down their heart with
   labor; they fell down and there was none to help; then they cried unto
   the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.'"
   I rejoiced and blessed God that there was such a prison-house to bring
   them to Jesus; yet I mourned that there were so many who still loved
   this house of bondage and would not escape, though there stood one with
   his finger always pointing to the words--"By the works of the law shall
   no flesh living be justified;" and to these other words, "By grace are
   ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
   God." I had seen enough of that prison-house, for I recollect being
   there myself, and I have some of the scars upon my spirit now. I desire
   not to go back to it, but as I have received Christ Jesus the Lord so
   would I walk in Him, knowing that if the Son make me free I shall be
   free indeed.

   VII. We must not leave these corridors till we have peered into all the
   cells; for we may not come here again. As I passed along, there was
   another cell, called The Low Dungeon of Despondency. I had read of this
   in the book of Jeremiah--a pit wherein there was no water, of which the
   prophet said, "He hath led me and brought me into darkness and not into
   light." I looked down. It was a deep, dark, doleful place; down in it I
   saw by the gloomy light of the warder's lantern a poor soul in very
   deep distress, and I bade him speak to me, and tell me his case. He
   said he had been a great offender, and he knew it; he hall been
   convinced of sin; he had heard the gospel preached, and sometimes he
   thought it was for him, but at other times he felt sure it was not;
   there were seasons when his spirit could lay hold of Christ, but there
   were times when he dared not hope. Now and then, he said, some gleams
   of light did come; once a week when he had his provision sent down, a
   little fresh bread and water, he did feel a little encouraged, but by
   the time the Monday came--for his provision was always sent down on
   Sunday--he felt himself as low and miserable as ever. I called out to
   him that there was a ladder up the side of the prison and if he would
   but climb it, he might escape, but the poor soul could not feel the
   steps. I reminded him that he need not be where he was, for a divine
   hand had let down ropes to draw him up, with soft cushions for his
   armholes; but I seemed as one that mocked him, and I heard some that
   tormented him bid him call me "liar." These were two villains called
   Mistrust and Timorous, who were bent upon keeping him here, even though
   they knew that he was an heir of heaven, and had a right to liberty.
   Finding myself powerless, I thus learned the more fully that the Lord
   must loose these prisoners or else they must be prisoners for many
   a-day; yet it was a great comfort to recollect that no soul ever died
   in that dungeon if it had really felt its need of Christ, and cried for
   mercy through his blood. No soul ever utterly perished while it called
   upon the name of the Lord; it might lie in the hold till it seemed as
   if the moss would grow on its eye-lids, and the worms eat its mildewed
   corpse, but it never did perish, for in due time it was brought by
   simple faith to believe that Christ is "able to save, even to the
   uttermost," and then they come up, O how quickly, from their low
   dungeon, and they sing more sweetly than others--"He hath brought me up
   out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay; he hath set my feet
   upon a rock, and put a new song in my mouth, and established my going."

   VIII. Shudder not at the clinging damps, for I must take you to another
   dungeon deeper than this last; it is called the inner prison. Paul and
   Silas were cast into the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the
   stocks, yet they sang in their prison; but in this dungeon no singing
   was ever heard. It is the hold of despair. I need not enlarge much in
   my description. I hope you have never been there; and I pray you never
   may. Ah! when a spirit once gets into that inner prison, comforts are
   turned at once into miseries, and the very promises of God appear to be
   in league for the destruction of the soul. John Bunyan describes old
   Giant Despair and his crab-tree cudgel better than I can do it.
   Sorrowful is that ear which has heard the grating of the huge iron
   door, and full of terror is the heart which has felt the chilly damps
   of that horrible pit. Are any of you in that dungeon to-day? Do you
   say, "I have grieved the Spirit, and he is gone; my day of grace is
   over; I have sinned against light and knowledge; I am lost?" O man,
   where are you? I must have you free. What a splendid trophy of grace
   you will make! My Master loves to find such great sinners as you are,
   that he may exhibit his power to save. Oh! what a platform for my Lord
   to rear the standard of his love upon, when he shall have fought with
   you and overcome you by his love. What a victory this shall be. How
   will the angels sing unto him that loved the vilest of the vile, and
   ransomed the despairing one out of the hand of cruel foes. I have more
   hope of you than I have of others; for when the surgeon enters the
   hospital after an accident, he always goes to the worse case first. If
   there be a man who has broken his finger only, "Oh! let him be," say
   they, "he can wait;" but if there be a Poor fellow who is much mangled,
   "Ah!" says the surgeon, "I must see to this case at once." So is it
   with you; but the Lord must loose you; I cannot. Only this I know, if
   you would but believe me, there is a key which will fit the lock of
   your door of unbelief. Come, look over this bunch of keys: "He is able
   to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him." "This is a
   faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came
   into the world to save sinners." "He that believeth on him is not
   condemned." "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I
   will give you rest." Brother, this inner dungeon can be opened by the
   Lord Jesus.

   "The gates of brass before him burst, the iron fetters yield."

   IX. I am getting to the end of this dark story now, but tarry a moment
   at the grating of the Devil's Torture Chamber, for I have been in it;
   yes, I have been tormented in it, and therefore I tell you no dream; I
   tarried in it till my soul melted because of agony, and therefore speak
   what I do know, and not what I have learned by report. There is a
   chamber in the experience of some men where the temptations of the
   devil exceed all belief. Read John Bunyan's "Grace abounding," if you
   would understand what I mean. The devil tempted him, he says, to doubt
   the existence of God; the truth of Scripture; the manhood of Christ;
   then his deity; and once, he says, he tempted him to say things which
   he will never write, lest he should pollute others. Ah! I remember a
   dark hour with myself when I, who do not remember to have even heard a
   blasphem in my youth, much less to have uttered one, heard rushing
   through my soul an infinite number of curses and blasphemies against
   the Most High God, till I put my hand to my mouth lest they should be
   uttered, and I was cast down, and cried to the merciful God that he
   would save me from them. Oh! the foul things which the fiend will
   inject into the spirit; the awful, damnable things, the offspring of
   his own infernal den, which he will foist upon us as our own thoughts
   in such hosts, and so quickly the one after the other, that the spirit
   has hardly time to swallow down its spittle, and though it hates and
   loathes these things, still it cannot escape from them, for it is in
   prison. Ah! well, thank God no soul ever perished through such
   profanities as those, for if we hate them they are none of ours; if we
   loathe them it is not our sin, but Satan's and God will in due time
   bring us to be free from these horrors. Though the hosts of hell may
   have ridden over our heads, yet, let us cry "Rejoice not over me O mine
   enemy, though I fall yet shall I rise again." Use your sword, poor
   prisoner! You have one. "It is written"--"the sword of the Spirit which
   is the Word of God." Give your foe a deadly stab; tell him that "God
   is, and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him," and
   you may yet see him spread his dragon wings and fly away. This, too, is
   a prison in which unbelief has confined both saint and sinner, and the
   Lord himself must loose these prisoners.

   X. Last of all, there is one dungeon which those confined therein have
   called the condemned cell. I was in it once. In that room the man
   writes bitter things against himself; he feels absolutely sure that the
   wrath of God abideth on him; he wonders the stones beneath his feet do
   not open a grave to swallow him up; he is astonished that the walls of
   the prison do not compress and crush him into nothingness; he marvels
   that he has his breath, or that the blood in his veins does not turn
   into rivers of flame. His spirit is in a dreadful state; he not only
   feels he shall be lost, but he thinks it is going to happen now. The
   condemned cell in Newgate, I am told, is just in such a corner that the
   condemned can hear the putting-up of the scaffold. Well do I remember
   hearing my scaffold put up, and the sound of the hammer of the lair as
   piece after piece was put together! It appeared as if I heard the noise
   of the crowd of men and devils who would witness my eternal execution,
   all of them howling and yelling out their accursed things against my
   spirit. Then there was a big bell that tolled out the hours, and I
   thought that very soon the last moment would arrive, and I must mount
   the fatal scaffold to be cast away for ever. Oh! that condemned cell!
   Next to Tophet, there can be no state more wretched than that of a man
   who is brought here! And yet let me remind you that when a man is
   thoroughly condemned in his own conscience he shall never be condemned.
   When he is once brought to see condemnation written on everything that
   he has done, though hell may flame in his face, he shall be led out,
   but not to execution; led out, but not to perish, "he shall be led
   forth with joy, and he shall go forth with peace; the mountains and the
   hills shall break forth before him into singing, and all the trees of
   the field shall clap their hands." As we read in history of one who was
   met with a pardon just when the rope was round his neck, just so does
   God deal with poor souls; when they feel the rope about their necks,
   acknowledge that God's sentence is just, and confess that if they
   perish they cannot complain, it is then that sovereign mercy steps in
   and cries, "I have blotted out like a cloud thine iniquities, and like
   a thick cloud thy sins; thy sins which are many are all forgiven thee."

   And now, thou glorious Jehovah, the Liberator, unto thee be praises!
   All thy redeemed bless thee, and those who are to-day in their dungeons
   cry unto thee! Stretch out thy bare arm, thou mighty Deliverer! Thou
   who didst send thy Son Jesus to redeem by blood, send now thy Spirit to
   set free by power, and this day, even this day, let multitudes rejoice
   in the liberty wherewith thou makest free; and unto Father, Son, and
   Holy Ghost, Israel's one Redeemer, be glory for ever and ever! Amen.

                         No Room for Christ in the Inn

   A Sermon

   (No. 485)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, December 21st, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling
   clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them
   in the inn."--Luke 2:7.

   IT WAS NEEDFUL that it should be distinctly proven, beyond all dispute,
   that our Lord sprang out of Judah. It was necessary, also, that he
   should be born in Bethlehem-Ephratah, according to the word of the Lord
   which he spake by his servant Micah. But how could a public recognition
   of the lineage of an obscure carpenter and an unknown maiden be
   procured? What interest could the keepers of registers be supposed to
   take in two such humble persons? As for the second matter, Mary lived
   at Nazareth in Galilee, and there seemed every probability that the
   birth would take place there; indeed, the period of her delivery was so
   near that, unless absolutely compelled, she would not be likely to
   undertake a long and tedious journey to the southern province of Judea.
   How are these two matters to be arranged? Can one turn of the wheel
   effect two purposes? It can be done! It shall be done! The official
   stamp of the Roman empire shall be affixed to the pedigree of the
   coming Son of David, and Bethlehem shall behold his nativity. A little
   tyrant, Herod, by some show of independent spirit, offends the greater
   tyrant, Augustus. Augustus informs him that he shall no longer treat
   him as a friend, but as a vassal; and albeit Herod makes the most
   abject submission, and his friends at the Roman court intercede for
   him, yet Augustus, to show his displeasure, orders a census to be taken
   of all the Jewish people, in readiness for a contemplated taxation,
   which, however, was not carried out till some ten years after. Even the
   winds and waves are not more fickle than a tyrant's will; but the Ruler
   of tempests knoweth how to rule the perverse spirits of princes. The
   Lord our God has a bit for the wildest war horse, and a hook for the
   most terrible leviathan. Autocratical Caesars are but puppets moved
   with invisible strings, mere drudges to the King of kings. Augustus
   must be made offended with Herod; he is constrained to tax the people;
   it is imperative that a census be taken; nay, it is of necessity that
   inconvenient, harsh, and tyrannical regulations should be published,
   and every person must repair to the town to which he was reputed to
   belong; thus, Mary is brought to Bethlehem, Jesus Christ is born as
   appointed, and, moreover, he is recognised officially as being
   descended from David by the fact that his mother came to Bethlehem as
   being of that lineage, remained there, and returned to Galilee without
   having her claims questioned, although the jealousy of all the women of
   the clan would have been aroused had an intruder ventured to claim a
   place among the few females to whom the birth of Messias was now by
   express prophecies confined. Remark here the wisdom of a God of
   providence, and believe that all things are ordered well.

   When all persons of the house of David were thus driven to Bethlehem,
   the scanty accommodation of the little town would soon be exhausted.
   Doubtless friends entertained their friends till their houses were all
   full, but Joseph had no such willing kinsmen in the town. There was the
   caravanserai, which was provided in every village, where free
   accommodation was given to travelers; this, too, was full, for coming
   from a distance, and compelled to travel slowly, the humble couple had
   arrived late in the day. The rooms within the great brick square were
   already occupied with families; there remained no better lodging, even
   for a woman in travail, than one of the meaner spaces appropriated to
   beasts of burden. The stall of the ass was the only place where the
   child could be born. By hanging a curtain at its front, and perhaps
   tethering the animal on the outer side to block: the passage, the
   needed seclusion coiled be obtained, and here, in the stable, was the
   King of Glory born and in the manner was he laid.

   My business this morning is to lead your meditations to the stable at
   Bethlehem, that you may see this great sight--the Savior in the manger,
   and think over the reason for this lowly couch--"because there was no
   room for them in the inn."

   I. I shall commence by remarking that THERE WERE OTHER REASONS WHY
   CHRIST SHOULD BE LAID IN THE MANGER.

   1. I think it was intended thus to show forth his humiliation. He came,
   according to prophecy, to be "despised and rejected of men, a man of
   sorrows and acquainted with grief;" he was to be "without form or
   comeliness," "a root out of a dry ground." Would it have been fitting
   that the man who was to die naked on the cross should be robed in
   purple at his birth? Would it not have been inappropriate that the
   Redeemer who was to be buried in a borrowed tomb should be born
   anywhere but in the humblest shed, and housed anywhere but in the most
   ignoble manner? The manger and the cross standing at the two
   extremities of the Savior's earthly life seem most fit and congruous
   the one to the other. He is to wear through life a peasaut's garb; he
   is to associate with fishermen; the lowly are to be his disciples; the
   cold mountains are often to be his only bed; he is to say, "Foxes have
   holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man hath not
   where to lay his head;" nothing, therefore, could he more fitting than
   that in his season of humiliation, when he laid aside all his glory,
   and took upon himself the form of a servant, and condescended even to
   the meanest estate, he should be laid in a manger.

   2. By being in a manger he was declared to be the king of the poor.
   They, doubtless, were at once able to recognize his relationship to
   them, from the position in which they found him. I believe it excited
   feelings of the tenderest brotherly kindness in the minds of the
   shepherds, when the angel said--"This shall be a sign unto you; you
   shall find the child wrapped in swaddling-clothes and lying in a
   manger." In the eyes of the poor, imperial robes excite no affection, a
   man in their own garb attracts their confidence. With what pertinacity
   will workingmen cleave to a leader of their own order, believing in him
   because he knows their toils, sympathizes in their sorrows, and feels
   an interest in all their concerns. Great commanders have readily won
   the hearts of their soldiers by sharing their hardships and roughing it
   as if they belonged to the ranks. The King of Men who was born in
   Bethlehem, was not exempted in his infancy from the common calamities
   of the poor, nay, his lot was even worse than theirs. I think I hear
   the shepherds comment on the manger-birth, "Ah!" said one to his
   fellow, "then he will not be like Herod the tyrant; he will remember
   the manger and feel for the poor; poor helpless infant, I feel a love
   for him even now, what miserable accommodation this cold world yields
   its Savior; it is not a Caesar that is born to-day; he will never
   trample down our fields with his armies, or slaughter our flocks for
   his courtiers, he will be the poor man's friend, the people's monarch;
   according to the words of our shepherd-king, he shall judge the poor of
   the people; he shall save the children of the needy." Surely the
   shepherds, and such as they--the poor of the earth, perceived at once
   that here was the plebeian king; noble in descent, but still as the
   Lord hath called him, "one chosen out of the people." Great Prince of
   Peace! the manger was thy royal cradle! Therein wast thou presented to
   all nations as Prince of our race, before whose presence there is
   neither barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free; but thou art Lord of all.
   Kings, your gold and silver would have been lavished on him if ye had
   known the Lord of Glory, but inasmuch as ye knew him not he was
   declared with demonstration to be a leader and a witness to the people.
   The things which are not, under him shall bring to nought the things
   that are, and the things that are despised which God hath chosen, shall
   under his leadership break in pieces the might, and pride, and majesty
   of human grandeur.

   3. Further, in thus being laid in a manger, he did, as it were, give an
   invitation to the most humble to come to him. We might tremble to
   approach a throne, but we cannot fear to approach a manger. Had we seen
   the Master at first riding in state through the streets of Jerusalem
   with garments laid in the way, and the palm-branches strewed, and the
   people crying, "Hosanna!" we might have thought, though even the
   thought would have been wrong, that he was not approachable. Even
   there, riding upon a colt the foal of an ass, he was so meek and lowly,
   that the young children clustered about him with their boyish
   "Hosanna!" Never could there be a being more approachable than Christ.
   No rough guards pushed poor petitioners away; no array of officious
   friends were allowed to keep off the importunate widow or the man who
   clamored that his son might be made whole; the hem of his garment was
   always trailing where sick folk could reach it, and he himself had a
   hand always ready to touch the disease, an ear to catch the faintest
   accents of misery, a soul going forth everywhere in rays of mercy, even
   as the light of the sun streams on every side beyond that orb itself.
   By being laid in a manger he proved himself a priest taken from among
   men, one who has suffered like his brethren, and therefore can be
   touched with a feeling of our infirmities. Of him it was said "He doth
   eat and drink with publicans and sinners;" "this man receiveth sinners
   and eateth with them." Even as an infant, by being laid in a manger, he
   was set forth as the sinner's friend. Come to him, ye that are weary
   and heavy-laden! Come to him, ye that are broken in spirit, ye who are
   bowed down in soul! Come to him, ye that despise yourselves and are
   despised of others! Come to him, publican and harlot! Come to him,
   thief and drunkard! In the manger there he lies, unguarded from your
   touch and unshielded from your gaze. Bow the knee, and kiss the Son of
   God; accept him as your Savior, for he puts himself into that manger
   that you may approach him. The throne of Solomon might awe you, but the
   manger of the Son of David must invite you.

   4. Methinks there was yet another mystery. You remember, brethren, that
   this place was free to all; it was an inn, and please to remember the
   inn in this case was not like our hotels, where accommodation and
   provision must be paid for. In the early and simple ages of the world
   every man considered it an honor to entertain a stranger; afterwards,
   as travelling became more common, many desired to shift the honor and
   pleasure upon their neighbors; wherefore should they engross all the
   dignity of hospitality? Further on still, some one person was appointed
   in each town and village, and was expected to entertain strangers in
   the name of the rest; but, as the ages grew less simple, and the
   pristine glow of brotherly love cooled down, the only provision made
   was the erection of a huge square block, arranged in rooms for the
   travelers, and with lower stages for the beasts, and here, with a
   certain provision of water and in some cases chopped straw for the
   cattle, the traveler must make himself as comfortable as he could. He
   had not to purchase admittance to the caravanserai, for it was free to
   all, and the stable especially so. Now, beloved, our Lord Jesus Christ
   was born in the stable of the inn to show how free he his to all
   comers. The Gospel is preached to every creature and shuts out none. We
   may say of the invitations of Holy Scripture,

   "None are excluded hence but those
   Who do themselves exclude;
   Welcome the learned and polite,
   The ignorant and rude.
   Though Jesus' grace can save the prince,
   The poor may take their share;
   No mortal has a just pretense
   To perish in despairs."

   Class exclusions are unknown here, and the prerogatives of caste are
   not acknowledged. No forms of etiquette are required in entering a
   stable; it cannot be an offense to enter the stable of a public
   caravanserai. So, if you desire to come to Christ you may come to him
   just as you are; you may come now. Whosoever among you hath the desire
   in his heart to trust Christ is free to do it. Jesus is free to you; he
   will receive you; he will welcome you with gladness, and to show this,
   I think, the young child was cradled in a manger. We know that sinners
   often imagine that they are shut out. Oftentimes the convicted
   conscience will write bitter things against itself and deny its part
   and lot in mercy's's stores. Brother, if God hath not shut thee out, do
   not shut thyself out. Until thou canst find it written in the Book that
   thou mayest not trust Christ; till thou canst quote a positive passage
   in which it is written that he is not able to save thee, I pray thee
   take that ether word wherein it is written--"He is able to save unto
   the uttermost them that come unto God by him." Venture on that promise;
   come to Christ in the strength and faith of it, and thou shalt find him
   free to all comers.

   5. We have not yet exhausted the reasons why the Son of Man was laid in
   a manger. It was at the manger that the beasts were fed; and does the
   Savior lie where weary beasts receive their provender, and shall there
   not be a mystery here? Alas, there are some men who have become so
   brutal through sin, so utterly depraved by their lusts, that to their
   own consciences every thing manlike has departed, but even to such the
   remedies of Jesus, the Great Physician, will apply. We are constantly
   reading in our papers of men who are called incorrigible, and it is
   fashionable just now to demand ferociously, that these men should be
   treated with unmingled severity. Some few years ago all the world went
   mad with a spurious humanity, crying out that gentleness would reform
   the brutal thief whom harsh punishments would harden hopelessly; now
   the current has turned, and everybody is demanding the abandonment of
   the present system. I am no advocate for treating criminals daintily;
   let their sin bring them a fair share of smart; but if by any means
   they can be reformed, pray let the means be tried. The day will come
   when the paroxysm of this garrotting fever is over, we shall blush to
   think that we were frightened by silly fears into a dangerous
   interference with a great and good work which hitherto has been
   successfully carried on. It is a fact that under the present system,
   which (abating some faults that it may be well to cure) is an admirable
   one, crime is growing less frequent, and the class of gross offenders
   has been materially lessened. Whereas in 1844 18,490 convicts were
   transported, in 1860 the corresponding number was 11,533, and that
   notwithstanding the increase of the population. The ticket-of-leave
   system, when the public would employ the convicts and so give them a
   chance of gaining a new character, worked so well that little more than
   one percent in a year were re-convicted, and even now only five per
   cent, per annum are found returning to crime and to prison. Well, now,
   if the five percent receive no good, or even become worse, ought we not
   to consider the other ninety-five, and pause awhile before we give
   loose to our vengeance and exchange a Christian system of hopeful mercy
   for the old barbarous rule of unmitigated severity. Beware, fellow
   citizens, beware of restoring the old idea that men can sin beyond hope
   of reformation, or you will generate criminals worse than those which
   now trouble us. The laws of Draco must ever be failures, but fear not
   for the ultimate triumph of plans which a Christian spirit has
   suggested. I have wandered from the subject,--I thought I might save
   some from the crime of opposing true philanthropy on account of a
   sudden panic; but I will return at once to the manger and the babe. I
   believe our Lord was laid in the manger where the beasts were fed, to
   show that even beast-like men may come to him and live. No creature can
   be so degraded that Christ cannot lift it up. Fall it may, and seem to
   fall most certainly to hell, but the long and strong arm of Christ can
   reach it even in its most desperate degradation; he can bring it up
   from apparently hopeless ruin. If there be one who has strolled in here
   this morning whom society abhors, and who abhors himself, my Master in
   the stable with the beasts presents himself as able to save the vilest
   of the vile, and to accept the worst of the worst even now. Believe on
   him and he will make thee a new creature.

   6. But as Christ was laid where beasts were fed, you will please to
   recollect that after he was gone beasts fed there again. It was only
   his presence which could glorify the manger, and here we learn that if
   Christ were taken away the world would go back to its former heathen
   darkness. Civilisation itself would die out, at least that part of it
   which really civilizes man, if the religion of Jesus could be
   extinguished. If Christ were taken away from the human heart, the most
   holy would become debased again, and those who claim kinship with
   angels would soon prove that they have relationship to devils. The
   manger, I say, would be a manger for beasts still, if the Lord of Glory
   were withdrawn, and we should go back to our sins and our lusts if
   Christ should once take away his grace and leave us to ourselves. For
   these reasons which I have mentioned, methinks, Christ was laid in a
   manger.

   II. But still the text says that he was laid in a manger because there
   was no room for him in the inn, and this leads us to the second remark,
   THAT THERE WERE OTHER PLACES BESIDES THE INN WHICH HAD NO ROOM FOR
   CHRIST.

   The palaces of emperors and the halls of kings afforded the royal
   stranger no refuge? Alas! my brethren, seldom is there room for Christ
   in palaces! How could the kings of earth receive the Lord? He is the
   Prince of Peace, and they delight in war! He breaks their bows and cuts
   their spears in sunder; he burneth their war-chariots in the fire. How
   could kings accept the humble Savior? They love grandeur and pomp, and
   he is all simplicity and meekness. He is a carpenter's son, and the
   fisherman's companion. How can princes find room for the new-born
   monarch? Why he teaches us to do to others as we would that they should
   do to us, and this is a thing which kings would find very hard to
   reconcile with the knavish tricks of politics and the grasping designs
   of ambition. O great ones of the earth, I am but little astonished that
   amid your glories, and pleasures, and wars, and councils, ye forget the
   Anointed, and cast out the Lord of All. There is no room for Christ
   with the kings. Look throughout the kingdoms of the earth now, and with
   here and there an exception it is still true--"The kings of the earth
   stand up, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord and
   against his Anointed." In heaven we shall see here and there a monarch;
   but ah! how few; indeed a child might write them. "Not many great men
   after the flesh, not many mighty are chosen." State-chambers, cabinets,
   throne-rooms, and royal palaces, are about as little frequented by
   Christ as the jungles and swamps of India by the cautious traveler. He
   frequents cottages far more often than regal residences, for there is
   no room for Jesus Christ in regal halls.

   "When the Eternal bows the skies
   To visit earthly things,
   With scorn divine he turns his eyes
   From towers of haughty kings.
   He bids his awful chariot roll
   Far downward from the skies,
   To visit every humble soul
   With pleasure in his eyes."

   But there were senators, there were forums of political discussion,
   there were the places where the representatives of the people make the
   laws, was there no room for Christ there? Alas! my brethren, none, and
   to this day there is very little room for Christ in parliaments. How
   seldom is religion recognised by politicians! Of course a
   State-religion, if it will consent to be a poor, tame, powerless thing,
   a lion with its teeth all drawn, its mane all shaven off, and its claws
   all trimmed--yes, that may be recognsed; but the true Christ and they
   that follow him and dare to obey his laws in an evil generation, what
   room is there for such? Christ and his gospel--oh! this is
   sectarianism, and is scarcely worthy of the notice of contempt. Who
   pleads for Jesus in the senate? Is not his religion, under the name of
   sectarianism, the great terror of all parties? Who quotes his golden
   rule as a direction for prime ministers, or preaches Christ-like
   forgiveness as a rule for national policy? One or two will give him a
   good word, but if it be put to the vote whether the Lord Jesus should
   be obeyed or no, it will be many a day before the ayes have it.
   Parties, policies, place-hunters, and pleasure-seekers exclude the
   Representative of Heaven from a place among representatives of Earth.

   Might there not be found some room for Christ in what is called good
   society? Were there not in Bethlehem some people that were very
   respectable, who kept themselves aloof from the common multitude;
   persons of reputation and standing--could not they find room for
   Christ? Ah! dear friends, it is too much the case that there is no room
   for Him in what is called good society. There is room for all the silly
   little forms by which men choose to trammel themselves; room for the
   vain niceties of etiquette; room for frivolous conversation; room for
   the adoration of the body, there is room for the setting up of this and
   that as the idol of the hour, but there is too little room for Christ,
   and it is far from fashionable to follow the Lord fully. The advent of
   Christ would be the last thing which gay society would desire; the very
   mention of his name by the lips of love would cause a strange
   sensation. Should you begin to talk about the things of Christ in many
   a circle, you would be tabooed at once. "I will never ask that man to
   my house again," so-and-so would say--"if he must bring his religion
   with him." Folly and finery, rank and honor, jewels and glitter,
   frivolity and fashion, all report that there is no room for Jesus in
   their abodes.

   But is there not room for him on the exchange? Cannot he be taken to
   the marts of commerce? Here are the shop-keepers of a shop-keeping
   nation--is there not room for Christ here? Ah! dear friends, how little
   of the spirit, and life, and doctrine of Christ can be found here! The
   trader finds it inconvenient to be too scrupulous; the merchant often
   discovers that if he is to make a fortune he must break his conscience.
   How many there are--well, I will not say they tell lies directly, but
   still, still, still--I had better say it plainly--they do lie
   indirectly with a vengeance. Who does not know as he rides along that
   there must be many liars abroad? for almost every house you see is "The
   cheapest house in London," which can hardly be; full sure they cannot
   all be cheapest! What sharp practice some indulge in! What puffery and
   falsehood! What cunning and sleight of hand! What woes would my Master
   pronounce on some of you if he looked into your shop windows, or stood
   behind your counters. Bankruptcies, swindlings, frauds are so abundant
   that in hosts of cases there is no room for Jesus in the mart or the
   shop.

   Then there are the schools of the philosophers, surely they will
   entertain him. The wise men will find in him incarnate wisdom; he, who
   as a youth is to become the teacher of doctors, who will sit down and
   ask them questions and receive their answers, surely he will find room
   at once among the Grecian sages, and men of sense and wit will honor
   him. "Room for him, Socrates and Plato! Stoics and Epicurians give ye
   way; and you, ye teachers of Israel, vacate your seats; if there is no
   room for this child without your going, go; we must have him in the
   schools of philosophy if we put you all forth." No, dear friends, but
   it is not so; there is very little room for Christ in colleges and
   universities, very little room for him in the seats of learning. How
   often learning helps men to raise objections to Christ! Too often
   learning is the forge where the nails are made for Christ's
   crucifixion; too often human wit has become the artificer who has
   pointed the spear and made the shaft with which his heart should be
   pierced. We must say it, that philosophy, falsely so called. (for true
   philosophy, if it were handled aright, must ever be Christ's friend)
   philosophy, falsely so called, hath done mischief to Christ, but seldom
   hath it served his cause. A few with splendid talents, a few of the
   erudite and profound have bowed like children at the feet of the Babe
   of Bethlehem, and have been honored in bowing there, but too many,
   conscious of their knowledge, stiff and stern in their conceit of
   wisdom, have said,--"Who is Christ, that we should acknowledge him?"
   They found no room for him in the schools.

   But there was surely one place where he could go--it was the Sanhedrim,
   where the elders sit. Or could he not be housed in the priestly chamber
   where the priests assemble with the Levites. Was there not room for him
   in the temple or the synagogue? No, he found no shelter there; it was
   there, his whole life long, that he found his most ferocious enemies.
   Not the common multitude, but the priests were the instigators of his
   death, the priests moved the people to say "Not this man, but
   Barabbas." The priests paid out their shekels to bribe the popular
   voice, and then Christ was hounded to his death. Surely there ought to
   have been room for him in the Church of his own people; but there was
   not. Too often in the priestly church, when once it becomes recognised
   and mounts to dignity, there is no room for Christ. I allude not now to
   any one denomination, but take the whole sweep of Christendom, and it
   is strange that when the Lord comes to his own his own receives him
   not. The most accursed enemies of true religion have been the men who
   pretended to be its advocates. It is little marvel when bishops
   undermine the popular faith in revelation; this is neither their first
   nor last offense. Who burned the martyrs, and made Smithfield a field
   of blood, a burning fiery furnace, a great altar for the Most High God?
   Why, those who professed to be anointed of the Lord, whose shaven
   crowns had received episcopal benediction. Who put John Bunyan in
   prison? Who chased such men as Owen and the Puritans from their
   pulpits? Who harried the Covenanters upon the mountains? Who, Sirs, but
   the professed messengers of heaven and priests of God? Who have hunted
   the baptized saints in every land, and hunt them still in many a
   Continental state? The priests ever; the priests ever; there is no room
   for Christ with the prophets of Baal, the servants of Babylon. The
   false hirelings that are not Christ's shepherds, and love not his
   sheep, have ever been the most ferocious enemies of our God and of his
   Christ. There is no room for him where his name is chanted in solemn
   hymns and his image lifted up amid smoke of incense. Go where ye will,
   and there is no space for the Prince of peace but with the humble and
   contrite spirits which by grace he prepares to yield him shelter.

   III. But now for our third remark, THE INN ITSELF HAD NO ROOM FOR HIM;
   and this was the main reason why he must be laid in a manger. What can
   we find in modern times which stands in the place of the inn? Well,
   there is public sentiment free to all. In this free land, men speak of
   what they like, and there is a public opinion upon every subject; and
   you know there is free toleration in this country to everything--permit
   me to say, toleration to everything but Christ. You will discover that
   the persecuting-spirit is now as much abroad as ever. There are still
   men at whom it is most fashionable to sneer. We never scoff at
   Christians now-a-days; we do not sneer at that respectable title, lest
   we should lose our own honor; we do not now-a-days, talk against the
   followers of Jesus under that name. No; but we have found out a way of
   doing it more safely. There is a pretty word of modern invention--a
   very pretty word--the word "Sectarian." Do you know what it means? A
   sectarian means a true Christian; a man who can afford to keep a
   conscience, and does not mind suffering for it; a man who, whatever he
   finds to be in that old Book, believes it, and acts upon it, and is
   zealous for it. I believe that the men aimed at under the term,
   "sectarians," are the true followers of Christ, and that the sneers and
   jeers, and all the nonsense that you are always reading and hearing, is
   really aimed at the Christian, the true Christian, only he is disguised
   and nick-named by the word sectarian. I would give not a farthing for
   your religion, nay, not even the turn of a rusty nail, unless you will
   sometimes win that title. If God's Word be true, every atom of it, then
   we should act upon it; and whatsoever the Lord commandeth, we should
   diligently keep and obey, remembering that our Master tells us if we
   break one of the least of his commandments, and teach men so, we shall
   be least in his kingdom. We ought to be very jealous, very precise,
   very anxious, that even in the minutiae of our Savior's laws, we may
   obey, having our eyes up to him as the eyes of servants are to their
   mistresses. But if you do this, you will find you are not tolerated,
   and you will get the cold shoulder in society. A zealous Christian will
   find as truly a cross to carry now-a-days, as in the days of Simon the
   Cyrenian. If you will hold your tongue, if you will leave sinners to
   perish, if you will never endeavor to propagate your faith, if you will
   silence all witnessing for truth, if, in fact, you will renounce all
   the attributes of a Christian, if you will cease to be what a Christian
   must be, then the world will say, "Ah! that is right; this is the
   religion we like." But if you will believe, believe firmly, and if you
   let your belief actuate your life, and if your belief is so precious
   that you feel compelled to spread it, then at once you will find that
   there is no room for Christ even in the inn of public sentiment, where
   everything else is received. Be an infidel, and none will therefore
   treat you contemptuously; but be a Christian, and many will despise
   you. "There was no room for him in the inn."

   How little room is there for Christ, too, in general conversation,
   which is also like an inn. We talk about many things; a man may
   now-a-days talk of any subject he pleases; no one can stop him and say,
   "There is a spy catching your words; he will report you to some central
   authority." Speech is very free in this land; but, ah! how little room
   is there for Christ in general talk! Even on Sunday afternoon how
   little room there is for Christ in some professed Christian's houses.
   They will talk about ministers, tell queer anecdotes about
   them--perhaps invent a few, or, at least, garnish the old ones, and add
   to them, and make them a little more brilliant; they will talk about
   the Sunday school, or the various agencies in connection with the
   Church, but how little they say about Christ! And if some one should in
   conversation make this remark, "Could we not speak upon the Godhead and
   manhood, the finished work and righteousness, the ascension, or the
   second advent of our Lord Jesus Christ," why we should see many, who
   even profess to be followers of Christ, who would hold up their heads
   and say, "Why, dear, that man is quite a fanatic, or else he would not
   think of introducing such a subject as that into general conversation."
   No, there is no room for him in the inn; to this day he can find but
   little access there.

   I address many who are working-men. You are employed among a great many
   artisans day after day; do you not find, brethren--I know you do--that
   there is very little room for Christ in the workshop? There is room
   there for everything else; there is room for swearing; there is room
   for drunkenness; there is room for lewd conversation; there is room for
   politics, slanders, or infidelities, but there is no room for Christ.
   Too many of our working men think religion would be an incumbrance, a
   chain, a miserable prison to them. They can frequent the theater, or
   listen in a lecture-hall, but the house of God is too dreary for them.
   I wish I were not compelled to say so, but truly in our factories,
   workshops, and foundries, there is no room for Christ. The world is
   elbowing and pushing for more room, till there is scarce a corner left
   where the Babe of Bethlehem can be laid.

   As for the inns of modern times--who would think of finding Christ
   there? Putting out of our catalogue those hotels and roadside houses
   which are needed for the accommodation of travelers, what greater curse
   have we than our taverns and pot-houses? What wider gates of hell? Who
   would ever resort to such places as we have flaring with gas light at
   the corners of all our streets to find Christ there? As well might we
   expect to find him in the bottomless pit! We should be just as likely
   to look for angels in hell, as to look for Christ in a gin palace! He
   who is separate from sinners, finds no fit society in the reeking
   temple of Bacchus. There is no room for Jesus in the inn. I think I
   would rather rot or feed the crows, than earn my daily bread by the
   pence of fools, the hard-earnings of the poor man, stolen from his
   ragged children, and his emaciated wife. What do many publicans fatten
   upon but the flesh, and bones, and blood, and souls of men. He who
   grows rich on the fruits of vice is a beast preparing for the
   slaughter. Truly, there is no room for Christ among the drunkards of
   Ephraim. They who have anything to do with Christ should hear him
   say--"Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate; touch not the
   unclean thing, and I will receive you, and be a father unto you, and ye
   shall be my sons and daughters." There is no room for Christ now-a-days
   even in the places of public resort.

   IV. This brings me to my fourth head, which is the most pertinent, and
   the most necessary to dwell upon for a moment. HAVE YOU ROOM FOR
   CHRIST? HAVE YOU ROOM FOR CHRIST?

   As the palace, and the forum, and the inn, have no room for Christ, and
   as the places of public resort have none, have you room for Christ?
   "Well," says one, "I have room for him, but I am not worthy that he
   should come to me." Ah! I did not ask about worthiness; have you room
   for him? "Oh," says one, "I have an empty void the world can never
   fill!" Ah! I see you have room for him. "Oh! but the room I have in my
   heart is so base!" So was the manger. "But it is so despicable!" So was
   the manger a thing to be despised. "Ah! but my heart is so foul!" So,
   perhaps, the manger may have been. "Oh! but I feel it is a place not at
   all fit for Christ!" Nor was the manger a place fit for him, and yet
   there was he laid." Oh! but I have been such a sinner; I feel as if my
   heart had been a den of beasts and devils!" Well, the manger had been a
   place where beasts had fed. Have you room for him? Never mind what the
   past has been; he can forget and forgive. It mattereth not what even
   the present state may be if thou mournest it. If thou hast but room for
   Christ he will come and be thy guest. Do not say, I pray you, "I hope I
   shall have room for him;" the time is come that he shall be born; Mary
   cannot wait months and years. Oh! sinner, if thou hast room for him let
   him be born in thy soul to-day. "To day if ye will hear his voice
   harden not your hearts as in the provocation." "To-day is the accepted
   time; today is the day of salvation." Room for Jesus! Room for Jesus
   now! "Oh!" saith one, "I have room for him, but will he come?" Will he
   come indeed! Do you but set the door of your heart open, do but say,
   "Jesus, Master, all unworthy and unclean I look to thee; come, lodge
   within my heart," and he will come to thee, and he will cleanse the
   manger of thy heart, nay, will transform it into a golden throne, and
   there he will sit and reign for ever and for ever. Oh! I have such a
   free Christ to preach this morning! I would I could preach him better.
   I have such a precious loving, Jesus to preach, he is willing to find a
   home in humble hearts. What! are there no hearts here this morning that
   will take him in? Must my eye glance round these galleries and look at
   many of you who are still without him, and are there none who will say,
   "Come in, come in?" Oh! it shall be a happy day for you if you shall be
   enabled to take him in your arms and receive him as the consolation of
   Israel! You may then look forward even to death with joy, and say with
   Simeon--"Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according
   to thy word, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation." My Master wants
   room! Room for him! Room for him! I, his herald, cry aloud, Room for
   the Savior! Room! Here is my royal Master--have you room for him? Here
   is the Son of God made flesh--have you room for him? Here is he who can
   forgive all sin--have you room for him? Here is he who can take you up
   out of the horrible pit and out of the miry clay--have you room for
   him? Here is he who when he cometh in will never go out again, but
   abide with you for ever to make your heart a heaven of joy and bliss
   for you-have you room for him? 'Tis all I ask. Your emptiness, your
   nothingness, your want of feeling, your want of goodness, your want of
   grace--all these will be but room for him. Have you room for him? Oh!
   Spirit of God, lead many to say, "Yes, my heart is ready." Ah! then he
   will come and dwell with you.

   "Joy to the world the Savior comes,
   The Savior promised long;
   Let every heart prepare a throne
   And every voice a song."

   V. I conclude with the remark, that if you have room for Christ, then
   from this day forth remember THE WORLD HAS NO ROOM FOR YOU; for the
   text says not only that there was no room for him, but look--"There was
   no room for them,"--no room for Joseph, nor for Mary, any more than for
   the babe. Who are his father, and mother, and sister, and brother, but
   those that receive his word and keep it? So, as there was no room for
   the blessed Virgin, nor for the reputed father, remember henceforth
   there is no room in this world for any true follower of Christ. There
   is no room for you to take your ease; no, you are to be a soldier of
   the cross, and you will find no ease in all your life-warfare. There is
   no room for you to sit down contented with your own attainments, for
   you are a traveler, and you are to forget the things that are behind,
   and press forward to that which is before; no room for you to hide your
   treasure in, for here the moth and rust doth corrupt; no room for you
   to put your confidence, for "Cursed is he that trusteth in man, and
   maketh flesh his arm." From this day there will be no room for you in
   the world's good opinion--they will count you to be an offscouring; no
   room for you in the world's polite society--you must go without the
   camp, bearing his reproach. From this time forth, I say, if you have
   room for Christ, the world will hardly find room of sufferance for you;
   you must expect now to be laughed at; now you must wear the fool's cap
   in men's esteem; and your song must be at the very beginning of your
   pilgrimage.

   "Jesus, I thy cross have taken,
   All to leave and follow thee;
   Naked, poor, despised, forsaken,
   Thou from hence my all shall be."

   There is no room for you in the worldling's love. If you expect that
   everybody will praise you, and that your good actions will all be
   applauded, you will quite be mistaken. The world, I say, has no room
   for the man who has room for Christ. If any man love the world, the
   love of the Father is not in him. "Woe unto you when all men speak well
   of you." "Ye are not of the world, even as Christ is not of the world."
   Thank God, you need not ask the world's hospitality. If it will give
   you but a stage for action, and lend you for an hour a grave to sleep
   in, 'tis all you need; you will require no permanent dwelling-place
   here, since you seek a city that is to come, which hath foundations;
   whose builder and maker is God. You are hurrying through this world as
   a stranger through a foreign land, and you rejoice to know that though
   you are an alien and a foreigner here, yet you are a fellow citizen
   with the saints, and of the household to God. What say you, young
   soldier, will you enlist on such terms as these? Will you give room for
   Christ when there is to be henceforth no room for you--when you are to
   be separated for ever, cut off from among the world's kith and kin
   mayhap--cut off from carnal confidence for ever? Are you willing,
   notwithstanding all this, to receive the traveler in? The Lord help you
   to do so, and to him shall be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

                                The Sinner's End

   A Sermon

   (No. 486)

   Delivered on Sunday Morning, December 28th, 1862, by

   Rev. C. H. SPURGEON,

   At the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington

   "Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
   Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down
   into destruction."--Psalm 73:17, 18.

   WANT OF UNDERSTANDING has destroyed many. The dark pit of ignorance has
   engulfed its thousands. Where the lack of understanding has not
   sufficed to slay, it has been able seriously to wound. Lack of
   understanding upon doctrinal truth, providential dealing, or inward
   experience, has often caused the people of God a vast amount of
   perplexity and sorrow, much of which they might have avoided had they
   been more careful to consider and understand the ways of the Lord. My
   brethren, if our eyes are dim, and our hearts forgetful as to eternal
   things, we shall be much vexed and tormented in mind, as David was when
   he understood not the sinner's end; for indeed it is a great mystery to
   ordinary reason to see the ungodly prospering and pampered while the
   righteous are chastened and afflicted. Let us, however, receive a clear
   understanding with regard to the death, judgment, and condemnation of
   the proud sinner, then at once our sorrows and suspicions are removed,
   and petulance gives place to gratitude. See the ox paraded through the
   streets covered with garlands; who envies its lot when he remembers the
   axe and the altar? The child may see nothing but the flowers, but from
   the man of understanding no childish ornament can conceal the victim's
   misery.

   The best place in which to be instructed with heavenly wisdom is the
   sanctuary of God. Until David went there he was in a mist, but entering
   its hallowed portals, he stood upon a mountain's summit, and the clouds
   floated far beneath his feet. You ask me what there could have been in
   the ancient sanctuary which could have enlightened David as to the end
   of the wicked. It may be, my brethren, that while he sat before the
   Lord in prayer, his spirit had such communion with the unseen God, that
   he looked into unseen things, and saw, as in an open vision, the
   ultimate doom of the graceless; or it may be that the hallowed songs of
   Israel's congregation foretold the overthrow of the foemen of Jehovah,
   and stirred the royal soul. Perhaps on that holy day the priests read
   in the scanty pages of the then written work some ancient story, such
   as refreshed the Psalmist in his happier seasons. It may have been that
   they rehearsed in the ears of the people the years beyond the flood,
   and the universal death which swept a world of sinners to their eternal
   prisons with a flood of wrath; or it may be that they read concerning
   Sodom and Gomorrah, and the fiery shower which utterly consumed the
   cities of the plain. It is not impossible that the theme of meditation
   led the devout monarch back to the plagues of Egypt, and the day of the
   Lord's vengeance, when he overthrew proud Pharaoh and his hosts in the
   midst of the Red Sea. The book of the wars of the Lord is full of
   notable records, all revealing most clearly that the right hand of the
   Lord hath sooner or later dashed in pieces all his enemies.

   Possibly when David went into the sanctuary of God the Law was read in
   his ears. He heard the blessings for obedience, the curses for
   rebellion; and as he listened to the thundering anathemas of the law
   which curses none in vain, it may be that he said, "Now understand I
   their end." Certainly a due estimate of the law of God, and the justice
   which maintains its dignity will clear up all fears concerning the
   ultimate escape of the wicked. Such a law and such a judge allow not
   the slightest suspicion that sin will always prosper. Moreover,
   brethren, David could not well go up to the sanctuary without
   witnessing a sacrifice, and as he saw the knife uplifted and driven
   into the throat of the victim, and knew that he himself was preserved
   from destruction by the sufferings of a substitute, represented by that
   lamb, he may have learnt that the wicked, having no such sacrifice to
   trust to, must be led as sheep to the slaughter, and as the bullock is
   felled by the axe, so must they be utterly destroyed. By some of these
   means, either by the sight of the sacrifice, or by his own meditations,
   or by the word read and the expositions given by prophets or priests in
   the sanctuary--it was in God's own house that he understood the end of
   the wicked. I trust, beloved, if you lack understanding in any
   spiritual matters, you will go up to the house of the Lord to inquire
   in his temple. The word of God is to us as the Urim and Thummim of the
   High Priest, prayer asks counsel at the hand of the Lord, and often the
   lip of the minister is God's oracle to our hearts. If you are vexed at
   any time because Providence seems to deal indulgently with the vile,
   and harshly with you, come ye to the spot where prayer is wont to be
   made, and while learning the justice of God, and the overthrow which he
   will surely bring upon the impenitent, ye shall go to your houses
   calmed in mind and disciplined in spirit. May you sing as Dr. Watts
   puts it--

   "I saw the wicked rise,
   And felt my heart repine,
   While haughty fools, with scornful eyes,
   In robes of honor shine.
   The tumults of my thought
   Held me in dark suspense,
   Till to thy house my feet were brought,
   To learn thy justice thence.
   Thy word with light and power
   Did my mistakes amend;
   I view'd the sinner's life before,
   But here I learned their end."

   This morning we have selected our subject for many ends, but more
   especially with the anxious desire that we may win souls for Christ;
   that we may see a feast of ingathering at the end of the year; that
   this may be the best of days to many, the birthday of many immortal
   souls. The burden of the Lord weighs down my soul this morning; my
   heart is filled even to bursting with an agony of desire that sinners
   may be saved. O Lord make bare thine arm this day, even this day.

   In enlarging upon our solemn subject, first, let us understand the
   sinner's end; secondly, let us profit by our understanding of it;
   thirdly, let us, having received this understanding, anxiously and
   earnestly warn thou whose end this must be except they repent.

   I. First, then, gathering up all our powers of mind and thought, LET US
   ENDEAVOR TO UNDERSTAND THE SINNER'S END. Let me rehearse it in your
   ears.

   The end of the sinner, like the end of every man else in this world, is
   death. When he dieth, it may be, that he will die gently, for often
   there are no bands in their death, but their strength is firm. A seared
   conscience gives a quietude of stupidity just as a full forgiveness of
   sin gives a peacefulness of perfect rest. They talk about another world
   as though they had no dread; they speak of standing before God as
   though they had no transgression. "Like sheep they are laid in the
   grave," "He fell asleep like a child," say his friends; and others
   exclaim, "He was so happy, that he must be a saint." Ah! this is but
   their apparent end. God knoweth that the dying repose of sinners is but
   the awful calm which heralds the eternal hurricane. The sun sets in
   glowing colors, but O the darkness of the black tempestuous night. The
   waters flash like silver as the soul descends into their bosom, but who
   shall tell the tenfold horrors which congregate within their dreadful
   deeps. Frequently, on the other hand, the death of the wicked is not
   thus peaceful. Not always can the hypocrite play out his game to the
   end; the mask slips off too soon and conscience tells the truth. Even
   in this world, with some men, the storm of everlasting wrath begins to
   beat upon the soul before it leaves the shelter of the body. Ah, then,
   the cries, the groans! What dread forebodings of the unquiet spirits!
   What visions of judgment! What anxious peerings into the midnight of
   future banishment and ruin! Ah, then the cravings after a little longer
   span of life, the clutchings at anything for the bare chance of hope.
   May your ears be spared the dreadful outcry of the spirit when it feels
   itself seized by the hand invisible and dragged downward to its certain
   doom. Give me sooner to be shut up in prison for months and years than
   to stand by dying beds such as I have myself witnessed. They have
   written their memorial on my young heart; the scars of the wounds they
   gave me are there still. Why the faces of some men, like mirrors,
   reflect the flames of hell while yet they live. All this, however, is
   but of secondary importance compared with that which follows death. To
   the ungodly there is awful significance in that verse of the
   Revelation, "I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat
   on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.

   One woe is past, but there are other woes to come. If death were all, I
   were not here this morning; for little mattereth it in what style a man
   dies, if it were not that he shall live again. The sinner's death is
   the death of all in which he took delight. No cups of drunkeness for
   thee again, no viol, no lute, no sound of music, no more the merry
   dance, no more the loud lascivious song, no jovial company, no
   highsounding blasphemies; all these are gone for ever. Dives, thy
   purple is plucked from off thee, the red games shall be thy mantle.
   Where now thy fine linen, wherefore is thy nakedness thus revealed to
   thy shame and contempt? Where now thy delicate tables, O thou who didst
   fare sumptuously every day? Thy parched lips shall crave in vain the
   blessed drop to cool thy tongue. Now where are thy riches, thou rich
   fool? Thy barns are indeed pulled down, but thou needest not build
   greater, thy corn, thy wine, thine oil have vanished like a dream, and
   thou art poor indeed, cursed with a depth of penury such as the
   dog-licked Lazarus never knew. Death removes every delight from the
   graceless. It takes away from his eye, his ear, his hand, his heart,
   everything which might yield him solace. The cruel Moabites of death
   shall cut down every fair tree of hope, and fill up with huge stones
   every well of comfort, and there shall be nothing left for the spirit
   but a dreary desert, barren of all joy or hope, which the soul must
   traverse with weary feet for ever and ever!

   Nor is this all. Let us understand their end yet farther. No sooner is
   the sinner dead than he stands before the bar of God in his disembodied
   state. That impure spirit is set before the blazing eye of God. Its
   deeds are well known to itself; it needs no opening of the great books
   as yet. A motion of the eternal finger bids it go its way. Whither can
   it go? It dare not climb to heaven; there is but one road open: it
   sinks to its appointed place. The expectation of future torment plagues
   the soul with a self-kindled hell, conscience becomes a never-dying,
   ever-gnawing worm. Conscience, I say, crieth in the souls of men, "Now
   where art thou? Thou art lost, and this thy lost estate thou hast
   brought upon thyself. Thou art not yet judged" says conscience; "yet
   thou art lost, for when those books are opened, thou knowest that their
   records will condemn thee." Memory wakes up and confirms the voice of
   conscience "'Tis true," she saith, "'tis true." Now the soul remembers
   its thousand faults and crimes. The judgment also shakes off its
   slumber, holds up its scales, and reminds the man that conscience
   clamours not amiss. Hope has been smitten down, but all the fears are
   living and full of vigor; like serpents with a hundred heads, they
   sting the heart through and through. The heart bowed down with
   unnumbered dreads moaneth within itself: "The awful trumpet will soon
   sound, my body will rise; I must suffer both in body and in soul for
   all my wrong-doings, there is no hope for me, no hope for me. Would God
   I had listened when I was warned! Ah! would to God that I had turned at
   the faithful rebuke, that when Jesus Christ was presented to me in the
   Gospel I had believed on him! But no, I despised my own salvation. I
   chose the fleeting pleasures of time, and for that poor price I have
   earned eternal ruin. I chose rather to drown my conscience than to let
   it lead me to glory. I turned my back upon the right, and now here I
   am, waiting like a prisoner in a condemned cell till the great assize
   shall come and I shall stand before the Judge."

   Let us go on to consider their end. The day of days, that dreadful day
   has come. The millennial rest is over, the righteous have had their
   thousand years of glory upon earth. Hark! the dread trumpet, louder
   than a thousand thunders, startles death and hell. Its awful sound
   shakes both earth and heaven; every tomb is rent and emptied. From the
   teeming womb of earth, that fruitful mother of mankind, up start
   multitudes upon multitudes of bodies, as though they were new-born; lo,
   from Hades come the spirits of the lost ones--and they each enter into
   the body in which once it sinned, while the righteous sit upon their
   thrones of glory, their transformed bodies made like unto the glorious
   body of Christ Jesus the Lord from heaven. The voice of the trumpet
   waxes exceeding loud and long, the sea has given up her dead, from
   tongues of fire, from lion's jaws, and from corruption's worm, all
   mortal flesh has been restored, atom to atom, bone to bone, at the fiat
   of Omnipotence all bodies are refashioned. And now the great white
   throne is set with pomp of angels. Every eye beholds it. The great
   books are open, and all men hear the rustling of their awful leaves.
   The finger of the hand that once was crucified turns leaf after leaf,
   and names of men are sounded forth--to glory, to destruction--"Come ye
   blessed;" "Depart ye cursed:"--these are the final arbiters of glory or
   of ruin. And now where art thou, sinner, for thy turn is come? Thy sins
   are read and published! Shame consumes thee. Thy proud face now mantles
   with a thousand blushes. Thou wouldst cover thyself, but thou canst
   not, and, most of all, thou art afraid of the face of him who to-day
   looks on thee with eyes of pity, but then with glances of fiery wrath,
   the face of Jesus, the face of the Lamb, the dying Lamb, then enthroned
   in judgment. Oh how ashamed thou wilt be to think thou hast despised
   him, to think that though he died for sinners, thou didst scorn and
   scoff him, didst malign his followers and slander his religion! How
   piteously wilt thou crave a veil of granite to hide thy shameful face
   from him. "Rocks hide me! Mountains fall upon me! Hide me from the face
   of him that sits upon the throne." But it must not--it must not be.

   "Where now, oh, where shall sinners seek
   For shelter in the general wreck?
   Shall falling rocks be o'er them thrown?
   See rocks, like snow, dissolving down."

   O, sinner, this is but the beginning of the end, for now thy sentence
   is read out, thy doom pronounced, hell opens her wide jaws, and thou
   fallest to destruction. Where art thou now? Body and soul re-married in
   an everlasting union, having sinned together must now suffer together,
   and that for ever. I cannot picture it; imagination's deepest dye
   paints not this tenfold night. I cannot pourtray the anguish which both
   soul and body must endure--each nerve a road for the hot feet of pain
   to travel on, each mental power a blazing furnace heated seven times
   hotter with raging flames of misery. Oh, my God, deliver us from ever
   knowing this in our own persons!

   Let us now pause and review the matter. It behoves us to remember
   concerning the sinner's latter end, that it is absolutely certain. The
   same "word" which says, "he that believeth shall be saved," makes it
   also equally certain and clear that "he that believeth not shall be
   damned." If God be true, then must sinners suffer. If sinners suffer
   not, then saints have no glory, our faith is vain, Christ's death was
   vain, and we may as well abide comfortably in our sins. Sinner,
   whatever philosophy may urge with its syllogisms, whatever scepticism
   may declare with her laughter and sneers, it is absolutely certain
   that, dying as thou art, the wrath of God shall come upon thee to the
   uttermost. If there were but a thousandth part of a fear that you or I
   might perish, it were wisdom to fly to Christ; but when it is not a
   "perhaps" or a "peradventure," but an absolute certainty that he who
   rejects Christ must be lost for ever, I do conjure you, if ye be
   rational men, see to it, and set your houses in order, for God will
   surely smite, though he tarry never so long. Though for ninety years
   thou avoid the arrows of his bow, his bolt will in due time find thee,
   and pierce thee through, and where art thou then?

   And as it is certain, so let us recollect that to the sinner it is
   often sudden. In such an hour as he thinketh not, to him the Son of man
   cometh. As pain upon a woman in travail, as the whirlwind on the
   traveler, as the eagle on his prey, so suddenly cometh death. Buying
   and selling, marrying and giving in marriage, chambering and full of
   wantonness, the ungodly man saith, "Go thy way for this time, when I
   have a more convenient season I will send for thee;" but as the frost
   often cometh when the buds are swelling ready for the spring and nips
   them on a sudden how often doth the frost of death nip all the hopeful
   happiness of ungodly men and it withers once for all. Hast thou a lease
   of thy life? Lives there a man who can insure that thou shalt breathe
   another hour? Let but thy blood freeze in its channels; let but thy
   breath stop for a moment, and where art thou? A spider's web is a
   strong cable when compared with the thread on which moral life depends.
   We have told you a thousand times, till the saying has become so trite
   that you smile when we repeat it, that life is frail, and yet ye live O
   men, as though your bones were brass, and your flesh were adamant, and
   your lives like the years of the Eternal God. As breaks the dream of
   the sleeper, as flies the cloud before the wind, as melts the foam from
   the breaker, as dies the meteor from the sky, so suddenly shall the
   sinner's joys pass from him for ever, and who shall measure the
   greatness of his amazement?

   Remember, O sons of men, how terrible is the end of the ungodly. You
   think it easy for me to talk of death and damnation now, and it is not
   very difficult for you to hear; but when you and I shall come to die,
   ah! then every word we have uttered shall have a weightier meaning than
   this dull hour can gather from it. Imagine the sinner dying. Weeping
   friends are about him; he tosses to and fro upon yon weary couch. The
   strong man is bowed down. The last struggle is come. Friends watch the
   glazing of the eyes; they wipe the clammy sweat from the brow. At last
   they say, "He is gone! He is gone!" Oh, my brethren, what amazement
   must seize upon the unsanctified spirit then! Ah, if his spirit could
   then speak, it would say, "It is all true that I was wont to hear. I
   spoke ill of the minister, the last sabbath in the year, for trying to
   frighten us, as I said, but he did not speak half so earnestly as he
   ought to have done. Oh, I wonder he did not fall down upon his and pray
   me to repent, but even if he had, I should have rejected his
   entreaties. Oh, if I had known! If I had known! If I had known all
   this; if I could have believed it; if I had not been such a fool as to
   doubt God's word and think it all a tale to frighten children with. Oh,
   if I had known all this! but now I am lost! lost! lost for ever!" I
   think I hear that spirit's wail of utter dismay, as it exclaims, "Yes,
   it has come; the thing whereof I was told it has all come to pass.
   Fixed is my everlasting state; no offers of mercy now; no blood of
   sprinkling now; no silver trumpet of the gospel now; no invitations to
   a loving Savior's bosom now! His terrors have broken me in pieces, and
   as a leaf is driven with the whirlwind, so am I driven I know not
   whither; but this I know, I am lost, lost, lost beyond all hope."
   Horrible is the sinner's end. I shudder while thus briefly I talk of
   it. O, believer, take heed that thou understandest this well.

   Do not fail to remember that the horror of the sinner's end will
   consist very much in the reflection that he will lose heaven. Is that a
   little? The harps of angels, the company of the redeemed, the smile of
   God, the society of Christ--is this a trifle--to lose the saint's best
   rest, that heritage for which martyrs wade through rivers of blood,
   that portion which Jesus thought it worth while to die that he might
   purchase. They lose all this, and then they earn in exchange the pains
   of hell, which are more desperate than tongue can tell. Consider a
   moment! He that indicts the punishment is God. What blows must He
   strike! He did but put out his finger and he cut Rahab and wounded the
   dragon in the Red Sea. What will it be when stroke after stroke shall
   fall from his heavy hand? Oh Omnipotence, Omnipotence, how dreadful are
   thy blows! Sinner, see and tremble; God himself comes out in battle
   against you? Why the arrows of a man, when they stick in your
   conscience, are very sharp, but what will the arrows of God be! How
   will they drink your blood and infuse poison into your veins. Even now,
   when you feel a little sickness you are afraid to die, and when you
   hear a heart-searching sermon, it makes you melancholy. But what will
   it be when God in thunderdressed, comes out against thee and his fire
   consumes thee like the stubble. Will God punish thee? O sinner, what
   punishment must that be which he inflicts? I tremble for thee. Flee, I
   pray thee, to the cross of Christ, where shelter is prepared.

   Remember, moreover, it will be a God without mercy, who will then dash
   thee in pieces. He is all mercy to thee to-day, O sinner. In the wooing
   words of the Gospel he bids thee live, and in his name I tell thee as
   God lives he willeth not thy death, but would rather thou shouldest
   turn unto him and live; but if thou wilt not live; if thou wilt be his
   enemy; if thou wilt run upon the point of his spear, then he will be
   even with thee in the day when mercy reigns in heaven, and justice
   holds its solitary court in hell. O that ye were wise, and would
   believe in Jesus to the salvation of your souls!

   I would have you know, O ye who choose your own destructions, that ye
   shall suffer universally. Now, if our head ache, or if our heart be
   palpitating, or a member be in pain, there are other parts of the body
   which are at ease; but then, every power of body and of mind shall
   suffer at one time. All the chords of man's nature shall vibrate with
   the discord of desolation. Then shall suffering be unceasing. Here we
   have a pause in our pain, the fever has its rests, paroxysms of agony
   have their seasons of quiet; but there in hell the gnashing of teeth
   shall be unceasing, the worm's gnawings shall know no cessation; on, on
   for ever--for ever a hot race of misery.

   Then, worst of all, it shall be without end. When ten thousand years
   have run their course, thou shalt be no nearer to the end than at
   first. When millions have been piled on millions, still the wrath shall
   be to come--to come, as much as if there had been no wrath at all. Ah!
   these are dreadful things to talk of, and you who hear or read my
   sermons know that I am falsely accused when men say that I dwell often
   upon this dreadful theme, but I feel as if there is no hope for some of
   you, unless I thunder at you. I know that often God has broken some
   hearts with an alarming sermon, who might never have been won by an
   inviting and wooing discourse. My experience goes to show that the
   great hammer of God breaks many hearts, and some of my more terrible
   sermons have been even more useful than those in which I lifted up the
   cross and tenderly pleaded with men. Both must be used, sometimes the
   love which draws, and anon the vengeance which drives. Oh, my hearers,
   I cannot bear the thought that you should be lost! As I meditate, I
   have a vision of some of you passing away from this world, and will you
   curse me? Will you curse me as you go down to the pit? Will you accuse
   me, "You were not faithful with me. Pastor, you did not warn me;
   minister, you did not strive with me?" No, by the help of my Lord,
   through whose grace I am called to the work of this ministry, I must, I
   will be clear of your blood. You shall not make your bed in hell
   without knowing what an uneasy resting place ye choose. Ye shall hear
   the warning. It shall ring in your ears. Who among us shall dwell with
   everlasting fire? Who among us shall abide with the eternal burnings?"
   I do assure you a true love speaks to you in every harsh word I utter,
   a love that cares too much for you to flatter you, a love which must
   tell you these things without mitigating them in any degree, lest ye
   perish through my trifling. "He that believeth not shall be damned."
   "Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?" Why will ye reject your mercies?
   God help you by his Holy Spirit to understand your latter end and lay
   hold on Jesus now.

   II. This brings us to our second remark--If we have understood the
   sinner's end, LET US NOW PROFIT BY IT. How can we do this?

   We can profit by it, first, by never envying the ungodly again. If at
   any time we feel with the Psalmist that we cannot understand how it is
   that the enemies of God enjoy the sweets of life, let us cease at once
   from such questionings, because we remember their latter end. Let
   David's confession warn us--

   "Lord, what a thoughtless wretch was I
   To mourn, and murmur, and repine,
   To see the wicked placed on high,
   In pride and robes of honor shine!
   But oh, their end! their dreadful end!
   Thy sanctuary taught me so:
   On slippery rocks I see them stand,
   And fiery billows roll below,
   Now let them boast how tall they rise,
   I'll never envy them again;
   There they may stand with haughty eyes,
   Till they plunge deep in endless pain."

   If the sinnner's end be so terrible, how grateful ought we to be, if we
   have been plucked from these devouring names! Brothers and sisters,
   what was there in us why God should have mercy on us? Can we ascribe
   the fact that we have been washed from sin in Jesu's blood, and made to
   choose the way of righteousness--can we ascribe this to anything but
   grace-free, rich, sovereign grace? Come then, let us with our tears for
   others mingle joyous gratitude to God for that eternal love which has
   delivered our souls from death, our eyes trom tears, and our feet from
   falling. Above all let us prize the sufferings of Christ beyond all
   cost. Oh, blessed cross, which has lifted us up from hell. Oh, dear
   wounds, which have become gates of heaven to us. Can we refuse to love
   that Son of man-that Son of God? Will we not to-day, at the foot of his
   dear cross, give ourselves to him anew, and ask him to bestow on us
   more grace, that we may live more to his honor, and spend and be spent
   in his service? Saved from hell, I must love thee, Jesus; and while
   life and being last, I must live and be prepared to die for thee.

   Again, beloved friends, how such a subject as this should lead you that
   profess to be followers of Christ to make your calling and election
   sure! If the end of the impenitent be so dreadful, let nothing content
   us but certainties with regard to our own escape from this woe. Have
   you any doubts this morning? Have no peace of mind till those doubts
   are all solved. Is there any question upon your spirit as to whether
   you have real faith in the living Savior? If so, rest not, I pray you,
   till in prayer and humble faith you have renewed your vows and come
   afresh to Christ. Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove
   yourselves; build on the rock; make sure work for eternity, lest it
   should happen after all, that you have been deceived. Oh, if it should
   turn out so. Alas! alas! alas! for you to have been so near to heaven
   and yet to be cast down to hell.

   Now this subject should teach Christians to be in earnest about the
   salvation of others. If heaven were a trifle we need not be zealous for
   the salvation of men. If the punishment of sin were some slight pain we
   need not exercise ourselves diligently to deliver men from it; but oh,
   if "eternity" be a solemn word, and if the wrath to come be terrible to
   bear, how should we be instant in season and out of season, striving to
   win others from the flames! What have you done this year, some of you?
   I fear me, brother Christians, some of you have done very little.
   Blessed be God, there are many earnest hearts among you; you are not
   all asleep; there are some of you who strive with both your hands to do
   your Master's work, but even you are not as earnest as you should be.
   The preacher puts himself here in the list, mournfully confessing that
   he does not preach as he desires to preach. Oh, had I the tears and
   cries of Baxter, or the fervent seraphic zeal of Whitfield, my soul
   were well content, but, alas! we preach coldly upon burning themes and
   carelessly upon matters which ought to make our hearts like flames of
   fire. But I say, brethren, are there not men and women here, members of
   this Church, doing nothing for Christ; no soul saved this year by you,
   Christ unhonoured by you; no gems placed in his crown? What have ye
   been living for, ye cumber-ground? Wherefore stand ye in the Church, ye
   fruitless trees? God make you--oh ye that do little for him--to humble
   yourselves before him, and to begin the next year with this
   determination, that knowing the terrors of the Lord, you will persuade
   men, and labor, and strive to bring sinners to the cross of Christ.

   III. But we must leave that point of instruction and come to our last
   and pleading point, and that is very earnestly to WARN THOSE WHOSE END
   THIS MUST BE EXCEPT THEY REPENT.

   And who are they? Please to remember we are not speaking now of people
   in the street, of drunkards, and harlots, and profane swearers, and
   such like--we know that their damnation is sure and just--but, alas, I
   need not look far. If I glance along these seats and look into faces
   upon which my eye rests every Sabbath day, there are some of you, some
   of you who are unconverted still. You are not immoral but you are
   unregenerated; you are not unamiable but you are ungracious, you are
   not far from the kingdom, but you are not in the kingdom. It is your
   end I speak of now, yours ye sons of godly mothers, yours ye daughters
   of holy parents--your end, unless God give you repentance. I want you
   to see where you are standing to-day. "Surely thou didst set them in
   slippery places." If it has ever been your lot to tread the glaciers of
   the Alps you will have seen upon that mighty river of ice, huge
   wave-like mountains of crystal, and deep fissures of unknown depth, and
   of an intensely blue color. If condemned to stand on one of these icy
   eminences with a yawning crevasse at its base, our peril would be
   extreme. Sinner it is on such slippery place you stand, only the danger
   is far greater than my metaphor sets forth.

   Your standing is smooth; pleasure attends you; yours are not the rough
   ways of penitence and contrition--sin's road is smooth--but ah how
   slippery from its very smoothness. O be warned, you must fall sooner or
   later, stand as firmly as you may. Sinner you may fall now, at once.
   The mountain yields beneath your feet, the slippery ice is melting
   every moment. Look down and learn your speedy doom. Yonder yawning gulf
   must soon receive you, while we look after you with hopeless tears. Our
   prayers cannot follow you; from your slippery standing place you fall
   and you are gone for ever. Death makes the place where you stand
   slippery, for it dissolves your life every hour. Time makes it
   slippery, for every instant it cuts the ground from under your feet.
   The vanities which you enjoy make your place slippery, for they are all
   like ice which shall melt before the sun. You have no foot-hold,
   sinner, you have no sure hope, no confidence. It is a melting thing you
   trust to. If you are depending on what you mean to do--that is no
   foot-hold. If you get peace from what you have felt or from what you
   have done--that is no foot-hold. It is a slippery place you stand in. I
   read yesterday of the hunter of the chamois springing from crag to crag
   after the game he had wounded. The creature leapt down many a frowning
   precipice, but the hunter fearlessly followed as best he could. At last
   in his hot haste he found himself slipping down a shelving rock. The
   stone crumbled away as it came in contact with his thickly-nailed
   shoes, which he tried to dig into the rock to stop his descent. He
   strove to seize on every little inequality, regardless of the sharp
   edges; but as his fingers, bent convulsively like talons, scraped the
   stone, it crumbled off as though it had been baked clay, tearing the
   skin like ribands from his fingers and cutting into his flesh. Having
   let go his long pole, he heard it slipping down behind him, its iron
   point changing as it went; and then it flew over the ledge bounding
   into the depths below. In a moment he must follow, for with all his
   endeavors he is unable to stop himself. His companion looks on in
   speechless horror. But heaven intervenes. Just as he expects to go over
   the brink, one foot is arrested in its descent by a slight inequality.
   He hardly dares to move lest the motion might break his foot-hold, but
   gently turning his head to see how far he is from the brink, he
   perceives that his foot has stopped not a couple of inches from the
   edge of the rock; those two inches further and destruction had been his
   lot.

   Ungodly man, in this mirror see thyself, you are sliding down a
   slippery place, you have neither foot-hold, nor hand-hold. All your
   hopes crumble beneath your weight. The Lord alone knows how near you
   are to your eternal ruin. Perhaps this morning you are scarce two
   inches from the edge of the precipice. Your drunken companion who died
   a few days ago, has just now gone over the edge. Did you not hear him
   falling--and you yourself are about to perish. Good God! the man is
   almost gone! Oh that I could stay you in your downward course. The Lord
   alone can do it, but he works by means. Turn round and gaze upon your
   past life; behold the wrath of God which must come on account of it.
   You are sliding down the slippery places to a fearful end, but the
   angel of mercy calls you, and the hand of love can save you. Hear how
   Jesus pleads with thee. "Put thy hand in mine," he says; "thou art
   lost, man, but I can save thee now." Poor wretch! wilt thou not do it.
   Then art thou lost. Oh wherefore wilt thou not, when love and
   tenderness would woo thee, wherefore wilt thou not put thy trust in
   him. He is able and willing to save thee, even now. Believe in Jesus,
   and though thou art now in slippery places thy feet shall soon be set
   upon a rock of safety. I know not how it is, the more earnestly I long
   to speak, and the more passionately I would set forth the danger of
   ungodly men, the more my tongue refuses. These weighty burdens of the
   Lord are not to be entrusted it seems to the power of oratory. I must
   stammer and groan them out to you. I must in short sentences tell out
   my message and leave it with you. I have the solemn conviction this
   morning that there are scores and hundreds of you who are on the road
   to hell. You know you are. If conscience speaks truly to you, you know
   you have never sought Christ, you have never put your trust in him, you
   are still what you always were, ungodly, unconverted. Is this a trifle?
   Oh, I ask you, I put it to your own judgments, is this a thing of which
   you ought to think carelessly? I pray you let your hearts speak. Is it
   not time that some of you began to think of these things? Nine years
   ago we had some hopes of you, those hopes have been disappointed up
   till now. As each year rolls round you promise yourself that the next
   shall be different; but there has been no change yet. May we not fear
   that you will continue entangled in the great net of procrastination
   until at last you will have eternally to regret that you kept
   deferring, and deferring, and deferring, till it was too late. The way
   of salvation is not hard to comprehend; it is no great mystery, it is
   simply "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved."
   Trust Christ with thy soul and he will save it. I know you will not do
   this unless the Holy Spirit constrains you, but this does not remove
   your responsibility. If you reject this great salvation you deserve to
   perish. When it is laid so clearly before you, if you refuse it, no eye
   can pity you among all the thousands in hell or all the millions in
   heaven.

   "How they deserve the deepest hell
   Who slight the joys above;
   What chains of vengeance must they feel
   Who break the cords of love."

   May I ask all Christian people to join in prayer for the ungodly. When
   I cannot plead as a preacher, I bless God I can plead as an
   intercessor. Let us spend, all of us, a little time this afternoon in
   private intercession. May I ask it of you as a great favor-occupy a
   little time this afternoon, each child of God, in praying for the
   unconverted among us. Conversion work does go on; there are many always
   coming to be united to the Church, but we want more; and we shall have
   more, if we pray for more.

   Make this afternoon a travailing time, and if we travail in birth God
   will give us the spiritual seed. It is to the Holy Spirit we must look
   for all true regeneration and conversion, therefore let us pray for the
   descent of his influence, and depend upon his omnipotence and the great
   work must and shall be done. Could I address you in the tones of an
   angel, yet I could not have more to say than this, "Sinner, fly to
   Christ. I am glad I am weak, for now the Master's power shall be the
   better seen. Lord, do thou the sinner turn, and make him feel the
   danger of his state, and find in Christ a ransom and a rescue, and to
   thy name be glory.--Amen.
