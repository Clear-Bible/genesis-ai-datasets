   "Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God
   of our salvation. He that is our God is the God of salvation, and unto
   God the Lord belong the issues from death."--Psalm 68:19-20.

   WE observe that this Psalm is a very difficult one. One of the ablest
   commentators calls it a titanic Psalm. It is truly a giant Psalm, and
   to master it means much labour. Yet it is by no means difficult to
   understand when it comet to practical duties, and to those doctrines
   which are vital. For instance, the two verses before us are very simple
   and do not need any explanation, but only need to be impressed upon our
   memory. So is it always throughout Holy Scripture; wherever there are
   difficult places, they do not touch vital truths. The matter of our
   salvation is plain enough. The Book of Revelation may be difficult, but
   not the Gospel according to Matthew. With regard to the future, there
   may be many clouds, but with regard to that blessed day which is past,
   which was the crisis of the world's history, when our Saviour hung upon
   the tree, the darkness is past, and the true light shineth there.
   Don't, therefore, busy yourselves most about those things which are
   most difficult, for they are usually of least importance. Concern your
   heart most with the simplicities of the gospel, for it is there, in the
   way, the truth, and the life, that the essential matter lies.

   Let us come to these two verses, and remark that they remind us first
   of the mercies of life. "Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with
   benefits." They then assure us of the mercies of death. "He that is our
   God is the God of our salvation, and unto God belong the issues from
   death." And then the two verses tell us of the common occupation of
   both life and death, namely, the blessing of God, whose mercy continues
   to us in both states. Blessed be Jehovah, whether I receive the daily
   load of his benefits, or whether he open for me the gates of the grace.

   Let us begin then, and contemplate for a few moments:--

   I. THE MERCIES OF OUR LIFE.

   The text saith, "He daily loadeth us with benefits." Let us keep to the
   English version just now. Take the words of it. What is it that he
   gives us-- Benefits. We have a very beautiful word in the English
   language--benevolence. You know that means good wishing, bene volens.
   He may be a benevolent man who is not able to do any act of kindness,
   to give any of his substance away for lack of any. But God's goodness
   to us is not merely bene volens, in which he wishes us well, but it is
   beneficence or good doing. His gifts and benefits are deeds of
   goodness, acts of goodness. He doth to us that which is good. He doth
   not only wish us well, and speak to us well, and direct us well, but he
   doeth well unto us. He doth not only say, "I pity thy last estate," but
   he delivers the lost out of their ruin. He doth not say, as the churl
   doth, "Be thou warmed, and be thou filled," and do no more, but,
   wishing us well, he doth well unto us; he warms cur hearts with his
   love, and fills them with his mercy, and sends us on our way rejoicing.
   It is true God speaks us well. What more could he say than, to us, he
   has said in his blessed Word? It is true he wishes us well. "As I live,
   saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but
   had rather that he turn unto me and live." But the essence of his
   goodness lies in this, that he goes beyond wishes and words into acts.

   Begin, brethren, with the greatest of his acts. "He spared not his own
   Son, but freely delivered him up for us all." In that gift he bath
   already given us all things, and from that blessed pledge he has never
   gone back, but he has given us all that we want for this life, and for
   the life to come, for ye have grace and glory, and hath abounded in
   each. The upper springs fail not, neither do the nether springs. If
   Christ is our perpetual bread and wine, so, too, our common bread, in
   answer to our prayer, is given us according to his assurance, "Thy
   bread shall be given thee, and thy water shall be sure." Will you try
   to think of the benefits which you have received, dear brother, dear
   sister? Turn them over now in your mind--the benefits that you have
   actually yourself received--not only read of, and heard of, and had
   promises of, but that you have received. Oh! the benefits of early
   education! the being restrained from, sin. Oh! the benefits of
   conviction! of being enlightened and made to see the guilt off sin. Oh!
   the sweet benefit of being led to the Saviour! made to stand at the
   cross foot, where the blood speaks better things than that of Abel. Oh!
   the benefit of perfect pardon and of righteousness, which covers us and
   justifies in the sight of God! What an unspeakable benefit is
   regeneration! Who shall prize the benefit of adoption? Who is he that
   shall describe the benefit of daily education in the things of God--of
   preservation from falling into final, vital sin--of sanctification
   carried on from day to day? We have benefits that we know of, but we
   probably have ten times as many that we know not of. Some of them come
   in at the front door of the house; some of the richest of them seem to
   steal in at the back door. They are among the most precious bounties
   that fly in with so soft a wing that we hear them not when they come.
   Ye shall sooner count the hairs on your head, or the dust upon the sand
   beach, than you shall be able to estimate the number of his benefits.

   Leave that word then, and note the next. It is said in the text
   concerning God's benefits, that he loads us with them--loads us with
   benefits. He does not put a little upon us of his goodness, but much;
   very much, until it becomes a load. Have you never known what it is to
   be bowed right down with such goodness? I have, I freely confess it--I
   have desired to praise him, but a sense of love so bowed me down that I
   could only adopt the language of the psalmist and say, "Praise is
   silent for thee, O God, in Zion." It seemed as if "words were but air,
   and tongues but clay, and his compassion's so divine," that it was
   impossible to speak of them. His mercies, as our hymn said just now,
   come as think and as fast as the moments do. In fact, it is literally
   so. Every moment needs heavings of the lungs, pulsings of the blood.
   The slightest circumstance might prevent one or the other. God's
   continued benefits come to us even in the simple form of preserved
   life. We are constantly exposed to peril. "Plagues and death around us
   fly."God preserves us from perils to the body. Our thoughts--whither
   might they go? They might in a moment lead us into heresies and foul
   blasphemies. It is no little thing to be preserved from that spiritual
   pestilence that walketh both in darkness and the noonday. Glory be to
   God, who sends us temporal and spiritual benefits so numerous, and each
   one so weighty, that eye cannot say less than this, "That he daily
   loadeth us with his benefits, until we seem bowed down to the earth
   under a joyful sense of obligation to his mercy." "He loadeth us with
   benefits."

   Oh! are any of you inclined to murmur? Do you think God deals hard with
   you? Well, you are what you are by his grace. Though you are not what
   you wish to be, yet remember you are not what, if strict justice were
   carried out, you would be. In the poor-house you might be--few admire
   that residence. In the prison you might be--God preserves you from the
   sin that would bring you there. In the lunatic asylum you might
   be--better men and women than you are have come to that. At the grave's
   mouth you might be--on the sick bed, on the verge of eternity. God's
   holiest saints have not been spared from the grave. In hell you might
   be--amongst the lost, wailing, but hopelessly wailing, gnashing your
   teeth in utter despair. O God, when we think of what we are not,
   because thy grace has kept us from it, we cannot but say, "Thou hast
   loaded us with benefits."

   But then think of what you are, you Christians. You are God's children;
   you are joint-heirs with Christ. "All things are yours"; ay, and
   "things to come," you have guaranteed too--preservation to the end, and
   you have, after the end of this life, glory without end. The "many
   mansions" are for you; the palms and harps of the glorified are for
   you. You have a share in all that Christ has, and is, and shall be. In
   all the gifts of his ascension you have a part; in the gifts that come
   to us through his session at the right hand of God, you have your
   share; and in, the glories of the Second Advent, the grand hope of the
   Church of God, you shall partake. See how, in the present, and in the
   past, and in the future, he loadeth you with benefits. There are two
   great words already.

   But the next word is equally large. "Blessed be the Lord, who daily
   loadeth us with benefits." A poor man shall call at your door, and you
   shall give to him all he wants for food, and cover him, and give him
   something to make glad his heart withal. If you do it once, you reckon
   that you have done well. Supposing he should call again to-morrow, you
   might find it in your heart to do the same. But suppose he called upon
   you seven days in the week: I am afraid that by degrees that would
   become seven times too often, for we count, when we have done men a
   good turn, that someone else should see to them next time. If we load
   them especially with benefits, we say, "Don't encroach; don't ride a
   willing horse too fast. You must not come again so often. You weary
   me." Ah! this is man; but look at God. He daily loadeth us with
   benefits. How many days has he done that with some of us? Thirty years?
   "Ah!" saith one, "I can talk of sixty years"--yes, and some of you of
   seventy and eighty years. Well, he has loaded you with benefits every
   day. You have never been above the rank of a pauper, so far as your God
   is concerned. But I will put it differently. You have been a gentleman
   commoner upon the goodness of God all your life. It has been your lot,
   like that of Mephibosheth, to sit daily at the King's table and give a
   portion from him. And yet you murmur. You have been unbelieving, proud,
   idle; all sorts of ill-tempers have you shown. Yet has he daily loaded
   you with benefits. It has sometimes seemed to be a wrestling between
   our sin and God's love, but up to this hour his love has conquered. We
   have drawn mightily upon his exchequer, but that exchequer has never
   been exhausted. The load of mercy which was used yesterday won't do for
   to-day. Like manna, it must come fresh and fresh, and the blessing is
   that it does come fresh and fresh. When God draws the curtain and
   stands in the sunlight, mercy streams in on the sunbeam; and when he
   shuts the eyelids of the day and the evening comes, it is mercy that
   puts its finger upon our eyelids and bids us rest. He "daily loadeth us
   with benefits"--every day; and he loads us with benefits not only on
   bright days, but on dark days. When we are sick, and tossing to and for
   upon the bed, he still is loading us with benefits, only in another
   form. He sends sometimes his choicest mercies to us in black-edged
   envelopes. The very brightest gems of heaven come to us, and we know
   them not. They sparkle not until faith's eye has seen them. Nature has
   not perceived their excellence. How he loadeth us with benefits on
   Sabbath days! There is a dear brother who is almost always here, who,
   when he sees me on Sunday mornings, generally makes use of some such
   exclamation as this, "Every day is good to me, but the Sabbath day is
   seven good days in one. It is blest seven times over." And, indeed, it
   so is. He loadeth us with benefits on the Sabbath. But then we have our
   Monday mercies and our Tuesday mercies too; and right on to the close
   on Saturday night the Lord continues to heap on his mercies one after
   another, that he may make us feel that we shall sooner weary with
   thanking him than he will weary in giving us cause for thankfulness.

   There is one other word--a very little one, but a sweet one too:
   "Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits." "Us."
   Personal matters bring sweetness to our soul, and herein lieth the
   wonder. That God should load David with benefits was marvellous to
   David, but not to me. The marvel to me is that he should load me with
   benefits. Beloved brethren and sisters, I do not feel your
   imperfections, and, therefore, I do not so much perceive the
   sovereignty of God in dealing graciously with you, but I know some of
   my own shortcomings, and they seem to me to be greater than those of
   others; therefore, do I with gratitude admire the abounding mercy of
   God that he should load me with benefits.

   "Why do I meet to hear his voice,

   And enter where there's room;

   While thousands make a wretched choice,

   And rather starve than come?"

   There may be some whose consciences will allow them to think that their
   praying made the distinction. I am not able to believe that, but I am
   compelled to feel that, if I enjoy the things of Christ that others do
   not, it is of the Lord's mercy, and not of any goodness in me, but
   entirely of his infinite grace. Let us bless the Lord at this hour
   because he loadeth us with benefits when he might have passed us by. He
   might have suffered us to go on heaping up our transgressions until the
   measure thereof had been filled, and then he might have made us reap
   for ever that which we had sown. Instead of this, he has made us--many
   of us--however unlikely persons--to be his chosen ones, and he hath
   loaded us with benefits.

   I have spoken very simply entirely with the view that those hearts that
   have tasted that the Lord is gracious may now wake up all their powers
   to praise and bless the name of the Most High. We must not pass away
   from this, however, without observing that our translation is not
   literal--indeed, is not the meaning of the passage. Those of you who
   will look at your Bibles will perceive that the words "who" and "with
   benefits", are put in it italics to show that they are not in the
   Hebrew, but have been supplied by the translators, as they thought them
   necessary to the sense; and some of the best interpreters say that the
   passage means this, "Blessed be the Lord, who daily beareth our
   burdens"; and I have little doubt that that is the correct translation.
   It is not so much that he loads us, as that he lifts our load for us,
   and bears it for us. Well, at any rate, that is a sweet rendering, "He
   daily bears our burden"; and it is a rendering which is a word of
   rebuke to some of you. Did you not come into this tabernacle tonight
   with your burdens on your back? Well, it was wrong you should ever have
   them. "Cast all your care on him, for he careth for you." A man who has
   a burden-bearer certainly need not bear the burden himself. Faith is
   never burdened, because she knows where to lay her burden. She hath a
   burden, but she puts it on the Almighty God. But unbelief, with a far
   less load than faith carries easily, is bowed down to the dust. Arise,
   O child of God, whatever thy burden is, and by an act of faith cast it
   upon God. You have done your little all; leave it now. Your fretfulness
   will not alter things. You cannot change he night, nor make one hair
   white or black. Why fret and worry? The world went on very well before
   you were born; it will when you are dead. Leave the helm. Whenever you
   have been foremast you made a mistake. He that carves for himself will
   cut his fingers; but when God has been foremost, and you have been
   content to follow, you have never had any mistake then; and when God
   has been your shepherd, you have been constrained to say, "I shall not
   want." Oh! then, have done with burden-bearing, and take up the
   language of the text, "Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our
   burdens."

   And then the text adds that he is "the God of our salvation." In this
   life we ought to praise him. His daily mercies are all sweetened with
   this reflection--that we are saved souls. Our morsel may be dry, but we
   dip it in this dainty sauce of his salvation. It is true I am poor, but
   I am saved. It is true I am sick, but I am saved. It is true I am
   obscure and unknown, but I am saved; and the salvation of God sweetens
   all. Then is it added to that, it is "our" salvation. He that can grasp
   the salvation which is in Christ and say, "This is mine," is rich to
   all the intents of bliss, and has his daily life gilded with joy.

   And then it is added beyond that, "our God." God is ours. He that is
   our God is the God of salvation. His omnipotence and omniscience, his
   immutability and his faithfulness--all his attributes are ours. The
   Father is ours; the Son is ours; the Spirit is ours. The God of
   election is ours; the God of redemption is ours; the God of
   sanctification is ours. Oh! with all this, how can we be cast down? Why
   should we repine! We have certainly abounding cause for blessing and
   praising the Lord. Those are the mercies If life. And now for a few
   minutes let us contemplate:--

   II. THE MERCIES OF DEATH.

   "Unto God belong the issues from death." This may mean several things.
   We will include its meanings under these heads. Unto God belong escapes
   from death. Oh! blessed be his name, we may come very near the grave,
   and the jaws of death may be open to receive us; but the pit cannot
   shut her mouth upon us until our hour is come.

   "Plagues of death around me fly.

   Till he please, I cannot die.

   Not a single shaft can hit,

   Until the God of love see fit.

   "What though a thousand at thy side,

   At thy right hand ten thousand, died?

   Our God, his chosen people saves,

   Amongst the dead, amidst the graves."

   Whatever occurs around us, we need not be alarmed. We are immortal
   until our work is done. And amidst infectious or contagious diseases,
   if we are called to go there, we may sit as easily as though in balmy
   air. It is not ours to preserve our life by neglecting our duty. It is
   better to die in service than live in idleness--better to glorify God
   and depart, than rot above ground in neglecting what he would have us
   to do. Unto God belong the issues from death. We may, therefore, go
   without temerity into any danger where duty calls us.

   But then unto God belong the issues that lead actually down to death.
   It may be we shall not die. There are some who are comforted much by
   the belief that Christ will come, and they shall not die. I do not
   profess to be among the number. I would as soon die as not, and rather,
   I think, if I might have my choice, for herein would be a greater
   conformity to the sufferings of Christ, in actually passing through the
   grave and rising again, than will fall to the lot of those who do not
   die. At all events, those who die not shall have no preference beyond
   them that sleep. So the Apostle tells us. "To" die is "gain"; and we
   will look upon it as such. But whenever we die, if we die, it will be
   at God's bidding. No one hath the key of death but the Lord of life. A
   thousand angels could not hurl us to the grave. All the devils in hell
   cannot destroy the least lamb in Christ's flock. Till God saith
   "Return," our spirit shall not leave the body; and we may be well
   content to depart when God saith the time is come. Oh! how blessed it
   is to think that the arrows of death are in the quiver of God, and they
   cannot be shot forth unless as the Lord wills it! Unto the Lord belong
   the issues from death.

   Think of this, then, about your departed friends The Master took them
   home. Think about your own departure. It is not to be arranged by your
   folly, not by the malice of the wicked. It will all be planned and
   designed by the infinite love of God.

   But the text may mean something more. Unto God belong the issues from
   death; that is, the coming up from death again. We place the bodies of
   the saints in the territory of death, but they are only put there, as
   it were, because there is a lien upon them for a time. They must come
   out. They must be delivered. for his word says, if we believe that
   Jesus Christ rose from the dead, "so also them that sleep in Jesus will
   God bring with him." There shall not be a bone or a piece of a bone of
   one of the saints kept by the enemy as a trophy of his conquest over
   the Saviour. Christ shall vanquish death entirely, and from the
   sepulchre he shall snatch all the trophies of the grave. We shall rise
   again, beloved. What though our bodies rot? What though they feed
   plants, and in due time feed animals, and pass through innumerable
   permutations and combinations? Yet he that made us can re-make us; and
   the voice that bade us live shall bid these bodies live again. "Unto
   God belong the issues from death." In this we are comforted--to fall
   asleep, because the angel of the churches shall guard our dust.

   And then this further thought. The issues from death grasp all that
   comes after death. The spirit issues from death--never touched by it
   indeed. Leaving the body behind a while, the spirit enters into a
   glory, waiting for the fulness. Then when Christ descends, and the
   trumpet sounds, and the dead in Christ rise in the first resurrection,
   then shall the re-united manhood enter into the fulness of the glory
   with a manifested Saviour. These issues from death belong to God, and
   God secures them to his people. He shall give them to them for whom he
   has appointed them. He shall give them to those whom he has made worthy
   by his grace to be partakers of this heritage. They belong to him--not
   to us by merit, but they are his gifts by covenant and by grace. Oh!
   then, how sweet it is to think, "The path down to the grave, my God has
   planted it. It is all his--all his own; and when my turn shall come to
   go into that garden wherein is the sepulchre, I shall be in my Father's
   territory." Jesus Christ is Lord of the sick-bed. He makes the bed of
   his people in their affliction. Even down to the borders of the
   grave--to the edge of Jordan's river--it is all Immanuel's land; and he
   often makes it the land of Beulah. And then, when I dip my foot in that
   chill stream, it is still my Master's country. I am not out of the
   presence of the Lord of life now I am coming to the land of death-shade
   and through the river, but it is the Master's river still, and, on the
   other side, it is my Lord's own land. When the shining ones shall meet
   me to conduct me up to the jewelled "city that hath foundations, whose
   builder and maker is God," I shall be always at home, always in my
   Father's country, never an exile, never come upon a tract of territory
   over which he hath no power. "Though I walk through the valley of the
   shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for he is with me. His rod and
   his staff, even there have they sway, and they shall comfort me." Be of
   good cheer, beloved. "Goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days
   of your life," and, life being ended, you shall "dwell in the house of
   your God for ever." In life and in death, you shall prove the tokens of
   his special love. And now we wind up with this. Here is:--

   III. THE COMMON OCCUPATIONS OF BOTH CONDITIONS.

   "I will praise thee in life

   I will praise thee in death

   I will praise thee as long

   As thou lendest me breath."

   "I will praise thee for ever and ever." The one occupation of a
   Christian is to praise his God. Now, in order to do this, we must
   maintain by God's grace a grateful, happy, praiseful frame of mind; and
   we must endeavour to express that condition of mind by songs of
   gratitude. This should be our morning's work. Should there not be the
   morning song? This should be the evening's work. Let it be our vespers
   to bless and praise God. Israel had the morning lamb and the evening
   lamb. Let us make both ends of the day bright with his praise, and
   during the day. We are in a wrong state of mind if we are not in a
   thankful state of mind. Depend upon it, there is something wrong with
   you if you cannot praise God. "Oh!" says one, "what, in trouble?" Yes,
   in every bitter trouble too, for Job could say, "The Lord gave, and the
   Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord." "But are we
   never to be sorrowful?" Yes, yet always rejoicing. How can that be? Ah!
   the Lord teach you it! It is a work of grace. Cast down, but yet, for
   all that, rejoicing in the Lord! He lifts up the light of his
   countenance upon us, even when heart and flesh are failing us. I say
   again, there is something amiss with us when our heart does not praise
   God. Do as much as you can also. When your heart is glad, try to.
   praise him with your lip. Do you work alone? Sing. Perhaps, if you work
   in company, you cannot; but sing with the heart. Men of the world, I am
   afraid, sing more than we do. I do not admire the most of their songs.
   They do not seem to have much sense about them--at least the modern
   ones. But let us sing some of the songs of Zion. You do not want to put
   your harps on the willows, but if they are there, take them down and
   praise the Lord, who leadeth you with benefits in life and in death.
   Therefore, habitually praise him. And, brethren and sisters, all our
   actions, as well as our thoughts and words, should tend to, the praise
   of him who always blesses us. You may stop praising God when he stops
   having mercy upon you--not till then; and as there is always a new
   mercy coming to your doors let new praise be going up out of your
   hearts." But how can I praise God by my actions? saith one. "Do all in
   the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks unto God and the Father by
   him." I try to praise God by preaching to-night. Some of you will go to
   your trades. Well, praise God at your trades. Any work, any lawful
   calling may be to the Christian priest--(and all Christians are
   priests)--the exercise of his sacred functions. You may make your
   smock-frock, if you will, a vestment; you shall make your meal a
   sacrament; you shall make everything in the house like the pots that
   were before the altar; the bells upon the horses shall be "holiness
   unto the Lord."

   And, dear brethren, to close. Let me remark that if we praise God
   ourselves by word and life, we ought to try to bring others to praise
   him too. You do not praise God, indeed, unless you want others to do
   so. It is a mark of sincere thankfulness that it desires others to
   assist it in the expression of its joy. Blessed be the Lord, this same
   Psalmist here, who says for himself, "Blessed he the Lord", is the
   writer of the 67th Psalm. You know how he says there, "Let the people
   praise thee--yea, let all the people praise thee!Oh! let the nations be
   glad and sing for joy!" Then he says again, "Let the people praise
   thee, O God; yea, let all the people praise thee!" Do your utmost to be
   the means, in God's hands, of bringing others to praise him. Tell them
   what he has done for you. Tell them of his saving grace. Invite sinners
   to Christ. Let it be:--

   "All your business here below

   To say,"Behold the Lamb!"

   and in this way you will be setting other tongues a-praising God, so
   that when your tongue is silent, there shall be others that will take
   up the strain. Labour for this, beloved, every one of you. Labour for
   the extension of the choir that shall sing the praises of the Saviour I
   trust we shall never fall into that narrow-minded spirit which seems to
   say, "It is enough for me if I am saved, and if those that go to my
   little place of worship are all right. It is quite enough." No, Master,
   thy throne is not to be set up in some little conventicle in a back
   street, and there alone. Thou are not to reign in some little corner of
   a city, and there alone Thou art not to take this island of Great
   Britain, and reign in it alone; nor in Europe--in one quarter of the
   earth alone. Let the whole earth be filled with his praise! And what
   Christian heart will refuse to say, "Amen and amen"? God grant it may
   be so! Amen.

                       Divine Destruction and Protection

   A Sermon

   (No. 3494)

   Published on Thursday, January 13th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [2]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have
   brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up
   the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish. I, Jehovah,
   have spoken and have done it."--Ezekiel 17:29.

   CAN your minds fly back to the time when there was no time, to the day
   when there was no day but the Ancient of Days? Can you speed back to
   that period when God dwelt alone, when this round world and all the
   things that be upon it, had not come from his hand; when the sun flamed
   not in his strength, and the stars flashed not in their brightness? Can
   you go back to the period when there were no angels, when cherubim and
   seraphim had not been born; and, if there be creatures elder than they,
   when none of them had as yet been formed? Is it possible, I say, for
   you to fly so far back as to contemplate God alone--no creature no
   breath of song, no motion of wing--God himself alone, without another?
   Then, indeed, he had no rival; none then could contest with him, for
   none existed. All power, and glory, and honour and majesty were
   gathered up into Himself. And we have no reason to believe that he was
   less glorious than He is now, when his ministers delight to do his
   pleasure; nor less great than now, when he has crested worlds on
   worlds, and thrown them into space, scattering over the sky stars with
   both his hands. He sat on no precarious throne; he needed none to add
   to his power; he needed none to bring him a revenue of praise; his
   all-sufficiency could spirit of no lack. Consider next, if ye can, the
   eternal purpose of God that he would create. He determines it in his
   mind. Could any but a divine motive actuate the Divine Architect? What
   must that motive have been? He creates that he may display his own
   perfections. He does beget, as it were, creatures after his own image
   that he may live in them; that he may manifest to others the joy, the
   pleasure, the satisfaction, which he so intensely feels in himself.
   Certain 1 am his own glory must have been the end he had in view; he
   would reveal his glory to the sons of men, to angels, and to such
   creatures as he had formed, in order that they might reflect his honour
   and sing his praise. You are not ignorant, my brethren, of the fact
   that sin entered into the world. You know that the creation, which had
   been harmonious as a psalm in God's praise, voluminous and exhaustive
   as a book in which he revealed his own character--this creation, once
   exceedingly fair, became foully marred. Rival instincts were produced,
   and rival Interests were set up. Man's will stood up against God's
   will; mar's profit against God's honour; man's device against God's
   counsel. Eve took of the accursed fruit, and Adam partook of the same,
   and henceforth man became a rival to God, just as Satan, aforetime, had
   rebelled against the blessed and only Potentate, and usurped authority.
   From the time when Satan fell, God's purpose was to break down
   everything which set itself up in opposition to him. From that day till
   now, no matter how great, how lofty, how apparently excellent a thing
   might be, it has been the rule with God to pull it down if it did not
   stand in him, and for him; yea, and wherever he has looked, no matter
   how mean a thing may have been, how low, how degraded to outward
   appearance, it has been God's constant rule to lift it up, if it stood
   in him, and for him. Or if, by the lifting up of the humble, he might
   throw scorn upon the haughty, he would thereby magnify his own absolute
   right to exercise sovereign control, and to do with men as he willed.

   Oh! that I could command the words of some of the mighty masters of
   song, or that I had an angel's voice, so much rather would I hymn this
   high majestic theme than speak of it in listless prose. But I cannot
   rise to the awful heights of this incomparable design. I contemplate it
   with awe not unmingled with admiration--the Eternal God withstanding
   everything that opposes itself against him--thrusting down the mighty
   from their seats, plucking off crowns from the heads of princes,
   degrading the escutcheons of nobles, trampling in the mire the fine
   linen and the scarlet of the rich, setting at nought the wisdom of the
   wise, divesting the philosopher of his toga, rending in pieces the
   robes of the priest, end pouring contempt upon everything that vaunts
   pretension or arrogates prestige in defiance of his sacred
   prescriptive, irrevocable lordship. There is no power or permanence, no
   warrant or worth, in any claim to greatness or goodness independent of
   God, or antagonistic to him. My conceptions are too dwarfish, my
   language is too feeble, to compass the grandeur of this theme. It's
   truth commends it, and its usefulness enhances it: since it bows the
   heart before God. and convinces us that then only are we in a fit state
   to be filled with his fulness, to live in his life, to be wise with his
   wisdom, and to be glorious in his glory, when we are emptied of our own
   conceits. Mine, however, will be a more practical lesson at this time;
   and I shall use more homely words than that nobler subject might have
   demanded.

   METHINKs I see a great forest which reaches for many a league. The
   trees are of divers growths, and of various ages. Some of them are very
   lofty. Here a towering cedar and yonder the storks have made their
   nests among the tall fir trees. Stout oaks there are that laugh at
   storms, and elms that will not be twisted with the tempest. See how
   they rival each other! And there are lowlier trees; some bearing fruit,
   though scarcely seen; others, like the vine, creeping upon the
   ground--so obscure they can hardly be observed. It is a strange forest
   in which trees of every clime are to be found; some green, verdant,
   lader with blossoms and with fruit; others dead, dry, withered, with
   scarce here and there a leaf. It is the evening, the cool of the day.
   The Lord God that visited the fair garden of Eden is come to walk in
   this forest. Along those deep glades, amidst that thick shade, the
   Almighty appears. He comes. How see I him? Bears he in his hand an
   awful axe, and cloth he pass his finger along its edge to see that it
   be keen? Strong is the arm that wields it. Howl, cedars, if once he
   life that axe against you. What means that Woodman to do? Wait, and let
   us hear him speak. Oh! ye trees of the field be silent before the Lord.
   Clap not your hands until we have heard him speak. "The trees of the
   field shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high
   tree--beware, ye towering cedars!--"that I have exalted the low
   tree"--take courage, ye lowly vines!--"have dried up the green
   tree"--wail, ye verdant elms--"and have made the dry tree to
   flourish";--hope, ye withered boughs!--"I the Lord have spoken, and
   have done it." Let the trees be silent before the Lord, for he cometh
   to judge them, and he judgeth them with much jealousy. That forest I
   have before my eyes; men like trees appear to me in the vision. While I
   gaze on this dense mass of people listening to my voice, let me
   interpret the Mighty Woodman's words to you. There are four notes of
   which we shall speak one after the other. May God sanctify the emblems
   to our profit, touching our ears, and teaching our hearts, that we may
   rightly understand what the Lord saith to the trees of the forest.

   I. "THUS SAITH THE LORD, THE TREES OF THE FIELD SHALL KNOW THAT I THE
   LORD HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THE HIGH TREE."

   Look over history, and you will see that everything gigantic in stature
   and colossal in dimensions, whatsoever has been great to human
   apprehension, grasping at earthly fame, has become an object for God's
   penetrating arrows, and a subject for his withering blight. A grand
   idea of universal monarchy flashed upon the mind of man. He would build
   a tower, the top whereof should reach to heaven. What did the Lord do
   with this fine scheme? "I will come down," said "to Babel, and see if
   it be altogether as they have said." Then he touched their tongues, and
   confounded their language, and scattered the imaginations of their
   hearts: so he laughed them to scorn, and left them to be a
   laughingstock to all generations. Then came the great power of Egypt.
   Pharaoh said, "Am I not lord of Thebes, with its hundred gates, and
   with its myriads of brazen chariots? Have I not a mighty host of
   cavalry? Who is equal to me? I speak, and the nations tremble." When
   the king hardened his heart, how did Jehovah--the King of kings--get
   himself honour from Pharaoh and his hosts? "Thou didst blow with thy
   wind; the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty waters.
   Sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his
   rider bath he cast into the sea!" In after years Babylon set herself up
   as a queen. "I shall be a lady for ever," said the gay metropolis of;
   the earth, the mighty city of Euphrates. "I sit alone; I shall see no
   sorrow." Behold, she decketh herself out with scarlet, she arrayeth
   herself with silk; all the nations of the earth are quiet when she
   ariseth nor is the sound of a whisper heard when the voice of her
   command goes forth. But where art thou, daughter of Assyria, where art
   thou now, O daughter of Chaldea, where is the crown which once circled
   thy brow and adorned thy heady Go, mark a leap of rubbish, and of
   desolate stones; hear the hooting of the owls and the howling of the
   dragons, as each one calleth to his fellow in the midst of a desolation
   which cannot be repaired! How art thou fallen from heaven, Lucifer, son
   of the morning! Thus God breaketh in pieces with his right hand
   everything arrogant and supercilious, that dares to assert greatness
   apart from his endowment, or to presume on authority other than he
   delegates. I might prolong the strain. I might tell you of Rome, and
   all the boastings of that Imperial mistress, point to her faded charms,
   and tell of her decay and her decadence. I might lead you back to
   Sennacherib and all his hosts overthrown, or recite the story of
   Nebuchadnezzar, driven out from the abodes of men, and feeding the
   beasts. I might show you lesser kings, kings of Israel, brought
   exceeding low, until they who had sat on the throne as princes pined in
   the dungeon among slaves. To multiply instances would be only to
   confirm the general current of history, and illustrate the fact that
   the Lord, even the Lord of hosts, always cuts down the high tree,
   humiliates the creature that exalts itself, and suffers no flesh to
   glory in his presence. That is the law of his government.

   The question arises, how does it concerns us? Doubtless it opens a sad
   prospect to those who are lifted up with pride, or inflated with
   self-opinion. Are there any among you who boast in heraldry a long
   succession of illustrious names which has ennobled your pedigree? Some
   people seem to think that the world is hardly good enough for them to
   tread upon, as if they were made of china, while other men are moulded
   but of common clay; they look down upon the public as an ignoble herd,
   and speak of the masses as the "many-headed" and the "great unwashed."
   Such a man will play the parasite to his own dear self, passionately
   cherish his own conceits and petulantly hold that whatever belongs to
   him is better than anyone else can procure for love or money, be it his
   house, or his horse, the water from his well, or the wine from his
   cellar. At his wit let all inferiors laugh; to his greed let all who,
   would receive his patronizing nod do obeisance. In stately isolation he
   will acknowledge no rival. Knowest thou, man, that in one respect thou
   hast a veritable pre-eminence?--thou mayest fairly challenge all thy
   fellows for one whose disposition the Lord hates more than he abhors
   shine. Among the seven abominations, your order ranks highest. No liar
   or murderer can claim a preeminence over you in vice so long as the
   Proverbs stand. Ere long, the heel of the Almighty shall be lifted
   higher than thy haughty head. He will cast thee down, be thy look never
   so proud; for the Lord hath purposed it to stain the pride of all
   glory, to bring into contempt all the excellency of the earth.

   There is, again, an arrogance of mind, of judgement, of opinion, just
   as ignorant--if not quite so grotesque--as his who dreams that his
   birth is of higher caste, and his blood of richer hue than other men.
   Humanity in the bulk is the idol of some people; and yonder I see the
   man who quotes himself as an illustrious specimen. He does not believe
   in the total depravity of human nature. Judging by himself, the
   statement that the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint, is a
   myth; or if it were ever true of a recreant Jew, it never was a fair
   indictment against such an orthodox Christian as he is. No, no; he has
   kept the law; he feels that in all things he is blameless; he has not
   erred, neither will he humble himself before the word that God speaks
   to us. In the opinion of such, the gospel that we preach is very good
   for harlots, thieves, and drunkards, but it is of no use to the
   righteous, for they have put down their own names among those who need
   no repentance. Admirable in their conduct, their temper amiable, and
   their disposition generous, a salvation by free grace would be wasted
   on them. The Lord will abase thee, be thou man or woman, whosoever thou
   mayest be; he will shame thee; the axe is ready to be laid at thy root
   even now. Thy goodness is not God's goodness, and thy righteousness is
   not Christ's righteousness; therefore, shall the moth consume it, and
   it shall be eaten away. Or it is my friend yonder, a working man, who
   says, " Well, I work as hard as anybody; I bring up my children as well
   as I can; I have nothing from the parish; and if I see a poor mate out
   of work, I always subscribe my mite, though I have not much to give
   away; can it be right to tell me that I am not in a fair way of going
   to heaven?" Ah! the Lord will deprive you of such boasting, for he will
   bring down all these high trees. You that have any righteousness of
   your own, whether you be rich or poor, the same word will apply to you
   all. What mattereth it whether you are born of princes, or the
   offspring of beggars, pride will nestle in any heart, and presumption
   will take advantage of any circumstances? Perhaps I may address some
   person who says, "Well, I am a member of the orthodox and true church;
   I have been baptized, and I have been confirmed after the most proper
   manner; I receive the Lord's supper on all fit and proper occasions.
   The clergyman from whom I take the sacrament has received apostolical
   ordination. How tasteful the architecture of our church! How decorous;
   the congregation! How enchanting the music! There are none of your
   rough wild notes that give vent to the feelings. Our organ is the
   perfection of mechanism, and it is played with the utmost skill. Our
   sacred singers perform their parts with reverent taste. Our litanies
   are wailed out in plaintive tones. We do the thing in the right style;
   and as I am a member of a branch of a catholic church, I hold myself to
   be an heir of eternal life." From thy towering imaginations, O man,
   thou shalt speedily totter. God will cast thee down, as surely as thou
   livest. No boasting, even of our orthodoxy, or of our attention to
   religious formalities, shall ever be allowed to abide his judgment. The
   Lord hath set his face against all boastings, and all confidences,
   other than a trust in the cross, and a holy reliance on the finished
   work and righteousness of Jesus Christ.

   Or shall it fare better with another class? There is our friend who
   says, "Well, well, I do not believe in forms and ceremonies; but, mark
   you, I always judge and weigh everything." He estimates himself as an
   independent thinker; he is bound by no precedents, fostered by no
   creeds, and considers that he is amenable to no judgment but his own.
   He owns no lord but his own conscience, no duty but such as he
   prescribes himself, and as for wisdom, he looks with indifference on
   all things whatsoever that his private judgment has not endorsed.
   Moreover, he doubts the inspiration of the Bible, and has his
   misgivings as to the authenticity of some parts of it. He indulges a
   little suspicion as to the deity of Christ, and as to the doctrines of
   grace; he professes much intelligence, but he exhibits gross
   negligence. Strong in his self-assertion, he makes light of the Word of
   God, and the will of God, while he holds prophets and apostles in
   little esteem. Ah! well, brother! God is against you; he will make a
   fool of you one of these days, if you are so wise as to exalt yourself
   above his revelation. The world shall see your folly. I tell thee,
   captious questioner, that the Lord will bring thee down. "Tut, tut,
   tut, I do not believe in any of these things," exclaims the successful
   merchant; "I say the best thing is to push ahead on one's own account;
   I mean to save money, to get rich, to rise in the world, as others have
   done who have made capital of their own wits, and taken care of their
   own interest." This is the religion of many people; their creed being
   that God will help those who help themselves; in their account, the
   highest wisdom is to attend to this world, and as for the world to
   come, the best policy is to ignore it. To the statutes of the Lord they
   give no heed; Evidently you see no need to depend on God. With a stout
   pair of arms and a good clear brain, you are confident you can make
   your own way in the world. Will you prosper, sir? I tell you no; for
   God is against you. The Lord will you down. Whether it be strength of
   limbs and lungs, force off brain and intellect, cunning works or
   scheming plans you rely upon, he will lay you level with the dub ere
   long. You shall know that he who exalteth himself against his maker
   maketh a sorry adventure. Disaster and everlasting confusion are your
   inevitable fate. II. FURTHERMORE THE LORD SAYS, "I WILL EXALT THE LOW
   TREE."

   Here is a word of comfort to some who specially need it. You remember
   Joseph in the dungeon, Israel in Egypt, Hannah in the family of
   Elkanah, David when Samuel would have passed him by, Hezekiah when
   Sennacherib rebuked him. Are not all these instances of God exalting
   the low tree? We have no time to expatiate on them, though they are
   well worthy of attentive study. But rather now let us ask, Where are
   the low trees here among ourselves? Who are they? The low trees are
   those poor in spirit, who think others better than they are themselves;
   who, instead of carving their names high, are willing to have them
   written low, because they feel they have nothing whereof to glory,
   nought wherein to boast. The low trees are the penitents, those who
   take their stand afar off with the publican, and say, "God, be merciful
   to me a sinner"; you that feel your own weakness to do anything aright;
   you who are conscious of your own worthlessness, and afraid that God
   will never hear your prayers; you that are bowed down low with a sense
   of guilt, and hardly dare to look up to the place where his honour
   dwelleth; you are the low trees, you are such as God exalteth. You,
   too, who tremble at his word; when, you see the threatening, fear lest
   it should be executed upon you; when you hear the promise, hardly think
   it possible that it can belong to you--you are low trees--God shall
   exalt you. You that feel your ignorance, and are willing to be
   instructed; you that are modest as children, and ready to sit at the
   feet of Jesus; you that have been broken in pieces until you feel that
   a crumb of mercy would be more than you deserve, and are willing to
   take any dole he is pleased to give--you are the low tree. And you that
   are despised, who walk in darkness and see no light; slandered for
   Christ's sake; reproached with crimes you never committed; you of whom
   the world is not worthy, though the world accounts you to be unworthy
   of its esteem--you are the low trees, and God shall exalt you. God
   grant us grace to humble ourselves under his mighty hand. The Lord
   exalteth the low trees. Is there a soul among you that is ready to
   despair--a low tree, so low that it can only compare itself to a
   bramble-bush? Well, God dwelt in a bush. You may think that if he
   should have enemy upon all other men, yet he must make an exception of
   you, so aggravated are your offenses, so depraved your disposition, and
   so alien to anything good your natural temperament. Oh! bless the Lord!
   He exalteth the low tree. If voice can reach now any humble, fearful,
   broken-hearted soul, even though that soul should say it is too good to
   be true, yet, in God's name, Let me assure you it is God's message to
   you. Rejoice, yea, sing unto your God, for he will lift up the poor
   from the dunghill, while he casteth down the mighty from the seats of
   their pomp and their places of power.

   III. THE LORD HAS ALSO DECLARED THAT "HE WILL DRY UP THE GREEN TREE."

   Whether that green tree be high or low, it does not matter; if it be
   green in itself, he will cut it down Mark you, a man may be as high as
   heaven; if it is God that makes him high, he will stand; but if he be
   high in creature-strength, land creature-merits, and creature-glory, he
   shall be brought down; and a man may be low without merit, if he is
   merely mean and mire, paltry and pitiable, not worth a straw. That is
   not the spirit of lowliness that God blesses. In like manner, a man may
   be garden because he is planted by the rivers of God's living waters,
   that is healthy enough; but those that are like the green bay tree of
   the Psalmist, trees growing in their own soil, never transplanted by
   grace, green in the verdure of worldly prosperity, and taking all their
   delight in earthly things--those are the trees God will dry up. Many I
   know of this kind! They profess to be God's people, and they say,
   "Well, I never have any anxiety about my eternal state; I do not see
   why I should ever have any doubts or fears. I have no prickings of
   conscience." This green tree boasts "that its leaves never fade, that
   its evidences are always bright." "They have no changes; therefore,
   they fear not God." "They have not been emptied from vessel to vessel.
   They have no cares; they walk confidently, they talk arrogantly; they
   smile disdainfully at some of God's people who groan over their
   infirmities and bemoan their sins. Perhaps they go the length of
   protesting that they have no vices, and do no wrong; or they will say,
   " Why, as for me, I have overcome my bad habits and made amends for my
   youthful follies and indiscretions; and if I have any faults, they are
   only such as are natural to men, and they do not cause me any trouble."
   He will even turn round and rail on this wise, "I cannot think how some
   of God's people can do as they do. " No; he is such a blessed,
   heavenly-minded hypocrite, that after he has condoned his own crimes,
   he condemns other people's customs; hence he holds up the severity of
   his judgment as a proof of the integrity of his character. He makes
   broad fringes to his own garment, and he cannot think how good men can
   wear such narrow fringes to theirs; he has a wide phylactery, and he
   cannot imagine how a godly man can wear a smaller one; he prays an hour
   and a half at the corner of the street; he cannot think that any man is
   godly who prays for ten minutes in his closet; he sounds a trumpet, and
   gives away three halfpence to the poor; he cannot understand people
   when they give away ten pounds, or a hundred pounds, in the cause of
   religion; he thinks they must have mercenary motives. He might stand up
   and say, "Look at me if you want to see what a man should be, how a
   Christian should live, and what his manner, and conduct, and
   conversation should be." Behold the man who counts himself the paragon
   of perfection. Have you never met with such green trees? I have. These
   people feed without fear, and mock without motive. They laugh at the
   idea of Paul's apprehension, when he said, "I keep under my body, lest,
   after having preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away." They
   think such fears inconsistent with the doctrine of final perseverance,
   though in this they are mistaken. A man may know that a true believer
   will persevere and yet be very much afraid that he shall not himself
   hold out, because he may suspect himself whether he is a true believer
   at all. This green tree is never troubled about the future; it is all
   right with him; he has launched upon a smooth, deceitful sea, and he
   believes it will be calm until he gets to the other side, as for human
   weakness, he knows nothing at all about that. He hears God's children
   crying, "Who shall deliver us from the body of this death?" and he
   looks shocked.

   The professor, too, who boasts his deep experience, is like this green
   tree. Young Christians he frowns at--he does not like young people. No;
   he would not have many young people in the church, because they might
   adulterate it, and bring down its spiritual tone. As to doctrine, he is
   profoundly learned; "he can a hair divide, betwixt the west and
   south-west side," and he censures at once the man who does not
   understand all the points. He understands more than the Bible reveals;
   he has improved upon the Scriptures; and those who cannot get up to his
   standard he despises. As for the poor, and meek, and sickly among the
   people of God, he, one of the strong ones, pushes them on either side,
   and will give them no rest. Never a man yet had anything to boast of as
   his own, but God was sure to dry him up. Let your life be green as
   emerald, it shall be brown as March dust before long. You seek sap and
   nourishment from yourselves. The spider's web--how soon it is blown
   away! Well it may, because it cometh out of the spider's own bowels.
   Everything that comes out of self, and lives on self, and hands on
   self, and fattens on self, no matter how green it may be, verily,
   verily, it shall be dried up. Lastly:--

   IV. THE LORD MAKES "THE DRY TREE TO FLOURISH."

   There are some dry trees to be pitied in their present condition, yet
   to be congratulated on their prospects. I would not say a word to
   encourage doubting, but I would say a great many words to encourage
   doubters. How many of God's people may be fitly compared to a dry tree!
   They have little joy; they have not got to full assurance. They are
   afraid to say, "My Beloved is mine, and I am his." Every night, before
   they go to bed, they feel such consciousness of sin that they can
   hardly sleep. They feel themselves so weak that where others go and
   think nothing of it, they dare not trust themselves. They are afraid to
   risk temptation; sometimes they are so conscious of their own weakness,
   that they do not exert themselves as they ought, and hence their low
   spirits, their melancholy, and their mourning. They think they are of
   no use to the church, they are half inclined to suspect it was a
   mistake for them to be baptized, and that they were to blame for
   uniting themselves with the people of God. "Oh!" say they, "if I be a
   lamb, I am the sickliest of the whole flock." Were I an heir of
   promise, should I feel the assaults of sin as I do? or should I be so
   much the prey of indwelling corruption, and become so dry and withered?
   Do they retire to the closet to pray, hardly a word can they utter.
   They come to, the assembly of believers, and though they do sing with
   their lips, the heart cannot sing as it would. There are times, too,
   when walking home they say, "I go where others go, but I get no
   comfort; if I were really the Lord's, should I be thus; if I did trust
   Christ, should I ever be so languid?" Brethren, if it is of your own
   bringing about that you are thus dry, I do not offer you any comfort;
   but if the Holy Spirit has led you to see your weakness, your
   nothingness, your deadness, then I am glad you have been brought to
   this pass, for God will cause the dry tree to flourish. When we are
   weak, then are we strong. The death warrant is gone out from God
   against everything that is of the creature. All that is of nature's
   spinning must be unravelled; not your bad nature only, but your good
   nature; not your vices only, but your virtues; not your sins alone, but
   your graces; all these must be contemned and despised so far as you
   venture to put them in the place at Christ. You must cry "Away with
   them; away with them," as if they were so much dung and dross. Christ's
   blood only for our hope, the Spirit's work only for our life. Here let
   us stand, and we shall be safe. The dry tree by divine grace shall
   flourish; the green tree, deserted by the dew of heaven, shall dry up.
   The low tree, fostered by the husbandman, shall mount even to the
   stars; the high tree, cut down by the axe of judgment, shall lay
   outstretched along the plains of ruin for ever.

   I think I see the last great day. There is a greater forest than this;
   this is but one corner of it. I see that forest stretched over sea and
   land, over mountain and valley. It is a forest of men. There stand the
   Pharisees, the self-righteous, the tyrants, the autocrats of haughty
   mien, the men of profound intellect with lofty brows, the men that
   questioned God's government; the infidels who said "Atheos," and denied
   his being. I see the high trees, that towered to such an elevation, and
   attracted so much admiration; and there, too, are the low trees
   contented to he low, for Christ of Nazareth was lowly. He, whose
   disciples they are, came riding on an ass even in the day of his
   highest earthly triumph. And now I hear the trumpet ring exceeding loud
   and long. Through the glades of that vast human forest the sound comes
   ringing broad and clear, "Smite! smite! smite! and let all the high
   trees fall!" O God, what a crash!

   He smote great kings and slew famous kings; for his mercy endureth for
   ever. He smites. What! another crash? The orthodox who rested in their
   orthodoxy, and the self-righteous men and women fall there; yonder the
   philosophic atheist, and here the scoffing sceptic; there the haughty
   persecutor, and there, again, the pompous priest and pretentious
   ceremonialist. Gather them; in Tophet, ordained of old, pile them
   together, cedar upon oak, and elm upon fir, gather them together. pile
   them on, pile them up; let the breath of the Lord, like a stream of
   brimstone, come upon the mighty pile. It is the funeral pyre of the
   giants. There lies the dead body of sin, and here comes the living
   spouse of sin, to be immolated upon that same pile. Her name is Pride.
   She comes; they clasp. The great transgression and the evil
   imagination, together they lie down, and the flames arise. Now the
   cedars, full of resin, give forth their flame, the sparks go up to
   heaven, and the flames even unto the throne of God, whilst I hear the
   voices of multitudes singing, "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! for
   thou hast judged the great temptress, even Pride, and thou hast given
   her up to be burned with fire!" But what of you, what of you, that will
   be faggots to that great burning? What of you, proud sons of men, that
   will be fuel to that flame? Turn ye, turn ye! Fly ye to Christ, and
   then you shall stand in the judgment, and join in the anthem,
   "Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!" "Be wise now therefore, O ye
   kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear,
   and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye
   perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are
   all they that put their trust in him." Oh! that we all may be found
   among the humble--not the haughty--in our present life, and that we may
   be gathered among the blessed, not destroyed among those whom the Lord
   abhorreth, in our future destiny!

                          The Judgment Upon Zacharias

   A Sermon

   (No. 3495)

   Published on Thursday, January 20th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [3]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "Thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these
   things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which
   shall be fulfilled in their season."--Luke 1:20.

   UNBELIEF is everywhere a great sin, and a grievous mistake. Unbelief
   has proved the ruin of those countless multitudes who, having heard the
   gospel, rejected it, died in their sins, have been consigned to the
   place of torment, and await the fiercer judgment of the last day. I
   might ask the question concerning this innumerable host, "Who slew all
   these?" The answer would be, "Unbelief." And when unbelief comes into
   the Christian's heart, as it does at times--for the truest believer has
   his times of doubt; even Abraham, the father of the faithful, sometimes
   had his misgivings--that unbelief does not assail his thoughts without
   withering his joys, and impairing his energies. There is nothing in the
   world that costs a saint so dear as doubt. If he disbelieve his God, he
   most assuredly robs himself of comfort, deprives himself of strength,
   and does himself a real injury. The case of Zacharias may be a, lesson
   to the Lord's people. It is to them I am going to speak: Zacharias is a
   striking example of the ills a good man may have to suffer as the
   result of his unbelief. In reviewing these, we mark:--

   I. THE CHARACTER AND POSITION OF ZACHARIAS.

   Here we cannot fail to discover some profitable lesson. He was
   undoubtedly a believer. He is said, in the sixth verse, to have been
   righteous before God. No man ever obtained such a reputation except by
   faith. "The just shall live by faith." No other righteousness than that
   which is faith is of any esteem in God's account. Such was the
   righteousness of Abraham, and such was the righteousness of all the
   saints before the advent of our Redeemer. Such, too, has been the
   standard ever since. Zacharias evidently was a real believer. Yet for
   all that, when the angel appeared to him, and God gave him the promise
   of a son, he was amazed, bewildered, incredulous, and could not credit,
   but only question the announcement. "How shall I know that these things
   shall be?"

   Nor was he merely a genuine believer; he was well instructed and
   greatly enlightened, for he was a priest, and, as a priest considered,
   he was righteous before God, and blameless, walking in all the
   commandments and ordinances of the Lord. That he was well instructed in
   the Word of God is undeniable. He could not otherwise have discharged
   his duty, for the priest's lips must keep knowledge, and he must teach
   men. Being proficient in the one, and competent for the other,
   ignorance offered him no excuse. Moreover, as a man of years, he was
   probably to be classed among the experienced saints of his time. He had
   borne the burden and heat of the day, and received proof upon proof of
   the abundant mercy of God. Now mark this. For any of us to doubt, who
   have been justified by faith is a shameful delinquency. For those to
   doubt who have, in addition to their first convictions, a thousand
   confirmations of the truth they have embraced, who are acquainted with
   the covenant and its rich inventory of promises, who are deeply taught
   in the things of God--for such to doubt involves a higher degree of
   guilt. I do not think that had Zacharias been a mere babe in grace, or
   an inexperienced stripling, his unbelief would have met with so stern a
   rebuke. It eras because he was a venerable priest, one thoroughly
   schooled in sacred truth, a man who for many years instructed the
   people of Israel in the oracles of God, that it became a crying evil
   for him to say, "Whereby shall I know this?" when the angel told him of
   his prayer being heard, and of the manner of answer the Lord would
   vouchsafe him.

   The high office that Zacharias held as a priest caused him to be looked
   up to. Hence his conduct was more narrowly watched, and his example had
   a wider influence. On a similar account we have need, all of us in our
   several spheres, to consider the effect of our actions upon others. The
   higher a man's position, the greater his responsibility; and in the
   event of any delinquency, the graver his offense. For you to
   disbelieve, my dear brother, who are at the head of a household, is
   worse than a personal infirmity; it is a violation of duty to your
   family. And you, dear friend, who preach the gospel, for you to
   disbelieve, who are looked upon by many as an advanced Christian, as a
   mature saint whose example may be safely followed by those who listen
   to your counsels--this is a great and a crying evil, whereby you
   disonour the Lord. I pray God that your conscience may be tenderly
   sensitive, and that you may be aroused to a sense of the dishonour you
   bring to him by your faithlessness.

   How peculiarly favoured Zacharias was! An angel of the Lord appeared
   unto him. Not to any of the other priests, when they were offering
   incense, did such a heavenly visitor come. And what welcome tidings he
   brought! It was a wonderful message that he was to be the father of a
   child great in the sight of the Lord, one who should minister in the
   spirit and power of Elias, and become the forerunner of the Messiah.
   This surely was a signal instance of Divine favour. And mark this,
   beloved, our God is very jealous of those whom he highly favours. You
   cannot have privileged communications from the Lord, or be admitted
   into close communion with him, without finding that he is a jealous
   God. The nearer we draw to him, the more hallowed our sense of his
   presence will be. But to doubt his Word, or question the fulfillment of
   his promise when he speaks kindly to us, must incur his censure. I
   speak after the manner of men; we do not expect from a stranger the
   esteem which we ought to merit from our servants. But our friends, who
   know us better than servants, ought to trust us more implicitly. And
   yet beyond common friendship in the near relation and tender attachment
   of a wife to her husband, the most unqualified confidence should be
   reposed. Even so, my brethren, if you and I have ever been permitted to
   lean our heads on Jesus' bosom; if we have sat down at his banquets,
   and his banner over us has been love; if we have been separated from
   the world by peculiar fellowship with Christ, and have had choice
   promises given us, we cannot, like Zacharias, ask, "Whereby shall I
   know" without grieving the Holy Spirit of God, and bringing upon
   ourselves some sad chastisement as the result.

   What soothing comfort had just been administered to Zacharias by the
   angel of the Lord! Was not the manner of the salutation fitted to allay
   terror, and inspire him with trust? The troubled thoughts that
   perplexed him, and the fear that fell upon him when the angel appeared
   standing at the right hand of the altar, met with no rebuke. If it was
   natural that so unwonted a vision should startle him, there was a
   gentle sympathising tenderness in the angel's address that might well
   hays stilled the throbbings of his heart. "Fear not, Zacharias, for thy
   prayer is heard." And so is it with us when the consolations of God
   have been neither few nor small, and when his good will towards us has
   been pointedly expressed, does it not make doubt and questioning more
   inexcusable? Do we not thereby aggravate the sin? Some of us have lived
   in the very bosom of comfort. Precious promises have been brought home
   to our souls; we have eaten of the marrow and the fatness; we have
   drunk the wines on the lees well refined. We are no strangers to the
   blessing of his eternal and unchanging love, or to the light of his
   countenance, which they prove who find grace in his eyes. Oh! if we
   begin to doubt after these discriminating love tokens, what apology can
   we offer? How can we hope to escape from the chastening rod?

   Moreover, the misgivings that Zacharias betrayed relate to the very
   subject on which his supplications were offered. It was in response to
   his own petition that the angel said to him, "Thy prayer is heard." I
   marvel at his faith that he should persevere in prayer for a boon which
   seemed, at his own and his wife's age, to have been out of the course
   of nature, and beyond the domain of hope, but I marvel a great deal
   more that, when the answer came to that very prayer, Zacharias could
   not believe it. So full often is it with us; nothing would surprise
   some of us more than to receive an answer to some of our prayers.
   Though we believe in the efficacy of prayer, at times we believe so
   feebly that when the answer comes, as come it does, we are astounded
   and filled with amazement. We can scarcely think of it as a purpose of
   God, it seems rather to us like a happy coincidence. Surely this adds
   greatly to the sin of unbelief. If we have been asking for mercy
   without expecting it, and pleading promises while harbouring mistrust,
   every prayer we have offered has been only a repetition of our secret
   unbelief; and it is God's faithfulness that brings our inconsistency to
   light.

   One other reflection is suggested by the narrative. Zacharias appears
   to have staggered at a promise which others, whom we might well imagine
   to have been weaker in faith then himself, implicitly believed. The
   veteran falters where a babe in grace might have taken courage. And is
   it not always a scandal if any of us who have been conspicuously
   favoured of God are ready to halt, while our feebler brethren and
   sisters are animated and encouraged? No dubious thought seems to have
   crossed the mind of Elizabeth, no incredulous expression fell from her
   lips. She said, "Thus hath the Lord dealt with me."

   This case was the very opposite of that of Abraham and Sarah. There
   Abraham believed, but Sarah doubted; here the wife believes in the face
   of her husband's scruples. In like manner, Mary, that humble village
   maiden, accepts with simple faith the high and holy salutation with
   which she was greeted. She just basks a natural question, and that
   being answered, she replies, "Be it unto me, according to thy Word."
   Her surprise was soon exchanged for joy, and by-and-by she begins to
   sing with a loud voice, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit
   hath rejoiced in God my Saviour." Not a little remarkable is this
   opening chapter of the Gospel according to Luke. Woman, who had been in
   the background through long preceding generations, seems suddenly to
   take a foremost place. Zacharias and Joseph stand in doubt, while
   Elizabeth and Mary exultingly believe. And who knows but I may be
   addressing some poor woman here who, in the depth of affliction, bodily
   suffering, and poverty, nevertheless rejoices in God with all her
   heart? But without a doubt, I am now speaking to many a man who is
   vexed with trifling cares, murmurs bitterly because of petty
   annoyances, and distrusts his God when clouds come over the sky so that
   ho sees not his way. Shame on our unbelief. Think shame of yourselves
   because of it, I pray you. Never does it disgrace us more than when the
   weaklings of the Lord's family put us to the blush by the simplicity
   and sincerity of their faith. The character and position of Zacharias
   may furnish a striking moral, but I do urgently entreat each Christian
   to point the keen edge of criticism at himself, and consider how much
   he is personally to blame for his own unbelief. Let us now proceed to
   investigate:--

   II. THE FAULT OF ZACHARIAS.

   Whence this perilous wavering at that privileged hour His fault was
   that he looked at the difficulty. "I am an old man," said he, "and my
   wife is well stricken in years." And while he looked at the difficulty
   he would fain suggest a remedy; he wanted a sign. "Whereby shall I know
   this?" It was not enough for him that God had said so; he wanted some
   collateral evidence to guarantee the truth of the word of the Lord.
   This is a very common fault among really good people. They look for a
   sign. I have often trembled in my own soul when I have felt an
   inclination thus to tempt the Lord by looking for some minute
   circumstance to verify a magnificent promise. When I have thought,
   "Hereby shall I know whether he does hear prayer or not," a cold shiver
   has passed over me, the shudder has gone through my soul that ever I
   should think of challenging the truth of God's word, when the fact is
   so certain. To us who have full often cried unto the Lord in our
   distresses and been delivered out of our troubles, to raise such a
   question is indeed ungrateful. For a child of God who habitually prays
   to his Father in heaven to look upon his faithfulness as a matter of
   uncertainty is to degrade himself, and to dishonour his Lord. Yet there
   is no denying the tendency and disposition among us to want a sign. As
   we read a prophecy of the future, we crave a token in the present. If
   the Lord were pleased to give us a sign, or if he told us to ask for a
   sign, we should be quite right in attaching a high importance thereto,
   but for us to doubt a plain promise, and, therefore, ask a sign, is to
   sin against the Lord. Sometimes we have wanted signs in spiritual
   things. Meet and proper is it for us to rejoice in the true delights of
   fellowship with Christ, but it ill becomes us to make our feelings a
   kind of test of our acceptance, or to say, "I will not believe God if
   he does not indulge me with certain manifestations of grace; unless he
   gives me the sweetmeats I crave, I will be sulky and sullen, and refuse
   to eat the children's bread." Why, such conduct is wilful and wicked;
   it is weak, and utterly inexcusable. Yet how many of us have been
   guilty of this folly? Now, as Zacharias stood upon the threshold of the
   gospel dispensation, and he was the first among those who heard the
   glad tidings to express unbelief, it was necessary that he should be
   made an example of.

   God would show at the very outset, even before John the Baptist was
   born, that unbelief could not be tolerated nor should it go
   unchastened. Therefore, his servant, Zacharias, must, as soon as he had
   asked for a sign, have such a sign as would make him suffer for months
   to come, constrain him to be sorry that he had ever dared to proffer
   the request. Oh! beloved, is our faith still so weak, and our
   experience still so contracted, that we cannot yet trust our God?
   Twenty years have we known him. Has he been a wilderness to us? Have
   his mercy and truth ever failed us in time of need? Shall all his
   tender dealings with us count for nothing? Do ye think so lightly of
   the gift of his Son, the gift of the Holy Ghost, of the dally
   providence which has guarded you, and of the hourly benediction which
   has been vouchsafed to you, that ye would fain put aside these
   unfailing benefits from your grateful remembrance, while you indulge in
   some paltry whim, and tempt the Lord your God by your mistrust? That be
   far from any of us! We would rather take up the position of Shadrach,
   Meshach, and Abednego, who, when arraigned before Nebuchadnezzar, and
   adjudged to be thrown into the furnace of fire, said, "Our God is able
   to deliver us; but," they added, "if not (though he should do nothing
   of the kind), nevertheless be it known unto thee, O king, we will not
   serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up."
   That is the spirit in which we ought to walk before God--"Though he
   slay me, yet will I trust in him." What if he does not spare my mothers
   precious life? What if he does not preserve my child from the ravages
   of the fatal epidemic? What if he take away the desire of mine eyes
   with a stroke? What if my business should cease to thrive? What if my
   health fail and my strength decay? What if I be dishonoured by the
   scandal of my neighbours? Shall I, therefore, cast off my allegiance to
   God, or betray my trust in him? Am I to engage in rebellion like this?
   Not flood nor flame could quench or extinguish his love to me. Shall
   anxiety or tribulation, disappointment or disaster sever my heart from
   devotion to him? Nay, God give me grace to see my cattle destroyed, and
   my goods swept away, and my children cut off in their prime, and to
   hear cruel taunts from the wife of my bosom; to be covered with sore
   boils, and to sit on a dunghill and scrape myself with a potsherd and
   find my best friends miserable comforters, and yet, in the midst of
   accumulated distresses, to be able to say, "I know that my Redeemer
   liveth; he has not failed to deliver me hitherto, and though, after my
   skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God. Though
   the fig-tree should not blossom, though the flocks and herds be cut
   off, yet will I trust in the Lord, and glory in the God of my
   salvation." If true to our high profession, the Christian's faith
   should not borrow its hue from the circumstances by which he is
   surrounded. To hanker after signs that a promise shall be fulfilled is
   obviously to show distrust of the prosmiser. "Now the God of hope fill
   you with all joy and peace, in believing, that ye may abound in hope
   through the power of the Holy Ghost." So shall you be restrained from
   asking for a petty sign to justify you in relying on his princely
   bounty. The Lord keep you from this great transgression! We pass on to
   observe:--

   III. THE PENALTY ZACHARIAS INCURRED.

   His morbid propensity was followed by a mortifying punishment. He had
   doubted, and he became dumb, and as the narrative clearly shows us, he
   was deaf likewise. Such was his chastisement, and it was sent not in
   anger, but in God's own covenant love. What a salutary medicine!
   Although bitter to the taste, how effective it was! Read his song, and
   you will see the evidence. He had been for months silent, quiet, shut
   out from all sound, and unable to make any. But well he had occupied
   his months of seclusion. He had searched the prophets--do you see that?
   He had been musing much upon the coming one--do you see that? Deep
   humility had taken the place of arrogant presumption. He was bowed down
   before the majesty of God, yet at the same time full of peace and
   blissful hope. Thus he looked into the glorious future. Oh! dear
   brethren, if you are prone to doubt, this sickness of the mind will
   require a strong corrective. Very likely God will give you some sharp
   medicine, but it shall work for your good. As his child, he will not
   chasten you so as to injure you, but he will chasten you so as to
   benefit you. I do not think children generally court the rod, however
   beneficial it may be, and yet I am quite sure there is no wise child of
   God who would not shrink from the graver ills which render such
   discipline essential to his soul's health.

   See how judgment was tempered with mercy. The punishment sent to
   Zacharias was not so severe as it might have been. Instead of being
   struck deaf and dumb, he might have been struck dead. As I read this
   passage, I wondered that God had not struck me deaf and dumb when I
   have spoken unbelieving words--when I have been depressed in spirit,
   and spoken unadvisedly with my lips. Oh! had the Lord been wroth with
   me, and said, "If that is your witness about me, you shall never speak
   again." That would have been most just, and I might have been a
   mournful instance of his indignation against his unbelieving servants;
   he has not dealt so with me; glory be to his name!

   And this chastisement did not invalidate the promise. The Lord did not
   say, "Well, Zacharias, as you don't believe it, your wife, Elizabeth,
   shall not have a son. There shall be a John born, but he shall not come
   to your house." Oh! no; that is a grand passage--"If we believe not,
   yet he abideth faithful; he cannot deny himself." The promise still
   stands. God does not take advantage of our unbelief to cry off and say,
   "I will give thee no blessings because thou doubtest me"--no, but
   having said it, he does it and his Word does not return unto him void.
   Even the trembling, doubting children, though they get the rod, get the
   blessing too; and the promise is fulfilled, though the father is dumb
   when the blessing comes. Very painful, indeed, was his chastisement.
   One would not like to be deaf and dumb for a day; but to be deaf and
   dumb for the space of nine months must have been a very painful trial
   to this man. Moreover, he could not bless the people; he could not
   speak a word; he could not instruct the people; he was useless for that
   part of the priest's work; and when the song went up within the
   hallowed walls of the temple, he could not hear it. He might know by
   signs that they were singing a hallelujah, yet his ears could not catch
   its grateful strains. That poor tongue of his was silent. He could not
   add a note to the volume of praise that went up to the God he loved. It
   must have been mournful to him to have no prayer in the family which he
   could hear, and in which he could join, and to be as good as dead for
   all practical purposes. Now I am afraid thence are many believers who
   have had to suffer something like this, for many days, on account of
   their unbelief. I think I can point out some who are unable to hear the
   gospel as once they did many years ago, a friend said that he could not
   hear me preach. I said to him, "Buy a horn." "No," he said, "it is not
   your voice; I can hear that, but I don't enjoy it." My reply was,
   "Perhaps that is my fault, but I am far from sure that it is not your
   own." I fear, in such cases, it is quite as often the hearer's fault as
   the preacher's fault. At any rate, when others profit, and our judgment
   approves, though our hearts find no refreshment, there is reason to
   suspect that in the dullness of our senses we are compelled to bear
   chastisement for our unbelief. You go where others go, and find no
   solace. You hear what edifies and comforts them, but there is no cheer
   for you. You are deaf; your ears are closed to what the Lord says. Very
   often it has happened, I fear, to some here, that, for want of faith,
   they have lost their speech. Time was when they could tell of the
   Lord's goodness, but they seem silent now. They could sing once, but
   their harps are hung on the willows now. As they get with their
   companions, they seem as if they have lost all their pleasant
   conversation. If they try the old accustomed strings of the time-worn
   harp, the ancient skill is gone. They cannot praise God as once they
   did; and all because on one occasion, when the promise was clear before
   their eyes, they would challenge and mistrust it. They could not rely
   upon their God. Little do we know how many Fatherly chastisements come
   upon us as the result of our unbelief.

   The lessons I gather, and with which I conclude, are these--First, if
   any of you, beloved, are weak in faith, do not be satisfied about it.
   Cry to God. Our God deserves better homage of us than a weak,
   attenuated faith can render him. He deserves to be trusted with such
   confidence as a child gives his parent. Ask him to increase your faith.
   And you who have faith, oh! keep it jealously, exercise it habitually;
   pray to the Lord to preserve it. Never begin to walk according to the
   sight of the eyes. Confer not with flesh and blood. Don't come down
   from that blessed height of simple confidence in God, but ask that you
   may abide there, and no longer doubt. The Church wants believers to
   believe for her, and to pray for her. "He that wavereth is like a wave
   of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed. Let not that man think that
   he shall receive anything of the Lord." Art thou strong in faith, be
   thou stronger still; art thou weak in faith, be thou strong.

   But let the unbeliever, the utter unbeliever, tremble. If a good man, a
   saved man, a noble and a blameless man was nevertheless for months
   struck dumb for unbelief, what will become of you who have no faith at
   all? He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
   believed on the Son of God. To you, unbeliever, no angel Gabriel will
   appear, but the destroying angel awaits you. What shall be your fearful
   chastisement? You will be silent; it will be eternal. Oh! you shall
   stand silent at the judgment-seat of Christ, unable to offer any excuse
   for your rebellion and unbelief. Unbelief will destroy the best of us:
   faith will save the worst of us. He that believeth on the Lord Jesus
   Christ hath eternal life--he that believeth not (whatever else his
   apparent excellences will assuredly perish. Faith, faith! this is the
   priceless saving thing to every one of us. The gift be yours to
   believe. The grace be yours to inherit the righteousness of faith. The
   joy be yours to believe in Jesus Christ with all your hearts. The
   triumph be yours to believe now to the saving of your souls. Amen.

                           Our Glorious Transforming

   A Sermon

   (No. 3496)

   Published on Thursday, January 27th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [4]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, September 3rd, 1871.

   "But now in Christ Jesus, ye, who sometimes were far off, are made nigh
   by the blood of Christ."--Ephesians 2:13.

   I DO not want you to feel at this time as if you were listening to a
   sermon, or to any sort of set discourse, but rather I should like, if
   it were possible, that you should feel as if you were alone with the
   Saviour, and were engaged in calm and quiet meditation; and I will try
   to be the prompter, standing at the elbow of your contemplation,
   suggesting one thought and then another; and I pray, dear brethren and
   sisters in, Christ, as many of you as are truly in him, that you may be
   able so to meditate as to be profited, and to say at the close, "My
   meditation on him was sweet. I will be glad in his name." There are
   three very simple things in the text. The first is what we were. Some
   time ago "we were far off." But secondly, what we are--we are "made
   nigh" And then there is the how, the means of this great change. It is
   "in Christ Jesus," and it is added, "by the blood of Christ." First,
   then, let us with humility consider, as believers:--

   I. WHAT WE WERE.

   There was a day when we passed from death unto life. All of us who are
   children of God have undergone a great and mysterious change; we have
   been new created, we have been born again. If any of you have not
   experienced this great change, I can only pray that you may, but you
   will not be likely to take much interest in the theme of meditation
   this evening. As many of you as have experienced this great change are
   now asked to recollect what you were. You were far off, first, in the
   respect that you were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel. The Jew
   was brought nigh. The Jewish people were favoured of God with light,
   while the rest of the world remained in darkness. "To them he gave" the
   oracles; with them he made a covenant; but as for the rest of the
   nations, they were left unclean and far off. They could not come near
   to God. This was our condition. We were Gentiles. We had no
   participation in the covenant that God had made with Abraham; we had no
   share in the sacrifices of Aaron or his successors. We could not come
   in by the way of circumcision. We were not born after the flesh, and we
   had no right to that fleshly covenant, however great its privileges. We
   are brought nigh now. All that the Jew ever had we have. We have all
   his privileges, and more. He had but the shadow, we have the substance.
   He had but the type: we have the reality. But aforetime we had neither
   shadow nor substance; we were afar off, and had no participation in
   them.

   And, beloved, when we think of our distance from God, there are three
   or four ways in which we may illustrate it. We were far off from God,
   for a vast cloudland of ignorance hung between our souls and him. We
   were lost as in a tangled wood in which there was no pathway. We were
   like some bird drifted out to sea that should be bereft of the instinct
   which guides it on its course, driven to and fro by every wind, and
   tossed like a wave by every tempest. We knew not God, neither did we
   care to know. We were in the dark with regard to him and his character;
   and when we did make guesses concerning God, they were very wide of the
   truth, and did not help to bring us at all near. He has taught us
   better now; he has taught us to call him Father, and to know that he is
   love. Since we have known God, or, rather, have been known of God, we
   have come nigh, but once our ignorance kept us very far off. Worse than
   that, there was between us and God a vast range of the mountains of
   sin. We can measure the Alps, the Andes have been sealed, but the
   mountains of sin no man has ever measured yet. They are very high. They
   pierce the clouds. Can you think of the mountains of your sin, beloved?
   Reckon them all up since your birth-sins of childhood, and youth, and
   manhood, and riper years; your sins against the gospel, and against the
   law; sins with the body, and sins with the mind; sins of every shape
   and form--ah! what a mountain range they make! And you were on one side
   of that mountain, and God was on the other. A holy God could not wink
   at sin, and you, an unholy being, could not have fellowship with the
   thrice Holy God. What a distance!--an impassable mountain sundered you
   from your God. It has all gone now. The mountains have sunk into the
   sea, our transgressions have all gone, but, oh! what hills they were
   once, and what mountains they were but a little while ago! In addition
   to these mountains, there was, on the other side nearest to God, a
   great gulf of divine wrath. God was angry, justly angry, with us. He
   could not have been God if sin had not made him angry. He that plays
   with sin is very far from knowing anything of the character of the Most
   High. There was a deep gulf. Ah! even the lost in hell know not how
   deep it is. They have been sinking: but this abyss hath no bottom.
   God's love is infinite. Who knoweth the power of shine anger, O Most
   High? It is all filled now, as far as we are concerned. Christ has
   bridged the chasm. He has taken us to the other side of it; he ho
   brought us nigh; but what a gulf it was! Look down and shudder. Have
   you ever stood on a glacier and looked down a crevasse, and taken a
   great stone and thrown it down, and waited till at last you heard the
   sound as it reached the bottom? Have not you shuddered at the thought
   of falling down that steep? But there you stood but a little while ago,
   an heir of wrath, even as others. So the Apostle puts it, "even as
   others." Oh! how far off you were!

   Nor was this all, for there was another division between you and God.
   When, dear friends, we were brought to feel our state, and to have some
   longings after the Most High, had the mountains of sin been moved and
   the chasm of wrath been filled, yet there remained another distance of
   our own making. There was a sea of fear rolling between us and God. We
   dare not come to him. He told us he would forgive, but we could not
   think it true. He said that the blood would cleanse us--the precious
   blood of the atoning sacrifice--but we thought our stains too crimson
   to be removed. We dared not believe in the infinite compassion of our
   Father. We ran from him; we could not trust him. Do you not remember
   those times when to believe seemed an impossibility, and salvation by
   faith appeared to be as difficult a thing as salvation by the works of
   the law? That sea has gone away now. We have been ferried o'er its
   streams. We have no fear of God now in the form of trembling, slavish
   fear; we are brought nigh and say, "Abba Father," with an untrembling
   tongue. You see then something of the distance there was between us and
   God, but I will illustrate it in another way. Think of God a moment.
   Your thoughts cannot reach him: he is infinitely pure; the heavens are
   not clean in his sight; and he charges his angels with folly. That is
   one side of the picture. Now look at yourself, a worm that has rebelled
   against its Creator, loathsome with sin, through and through defiled.
   When I see a beggar and a prince stand together I see a distance, but
   ah! it is but an inch, a span, compared with the infinite leagues of
   distance in character and nature between God and the fallen man. Who
   but Christ could have lifted up from so low an estate to so high a
   condition--from fellowship with devils unto communion with Jehovah
   himself? The distance was inconceivable. We were lost in wonder at the
   greatness of the love that made it all to vanish. We were afar off.

   Now I have stated that very simply. Think it over a minute. And what do
   you feel as the result of your thought? Why, humility rises. Suppose
   you are a very experienced Christian, and a very intelligent reader of
   the Bible; suppose that for many years your have been able to maintain
   a consistent character. Ah! my dear brother, my dear sister, you have
   nothing whereof glory when you recollect what you were, and what you
   would have been still if it had not been for sovereign grace. You,
   perhaps, have forgotten a little that you were just what the Bible
   says. You have been so contemplating your present privileges that you
   have for a while failed to remember that it is only by the grace of God
   that you are what you are. Let these considerations bring you beck to
   your true condition. And now with lowly reverence at the cross-foot bow
   down your soul and say, "My Lord, between me and the greatest reprobate
   there is no difference but what thy grace has made; between me and lost
   souls in hell there is no difference except what shine infinite
   compassion has deigned to make. I humbly bless thee, and adore thee,
   and love thee, because thou hast brought me nigh."

   And now we shall continue our contemplation, but take the second point.
   We have a bitter pill in this first one, but the next consideration
   kills it, takes the bitterness away, and sweetens it. It is:

   II. WHAT WE ARE--WHAT WE ARE

   "We are made nigh through the blood of Christ." You will please to
   observe that the Apostle does not say, "We hope we are"; he speaks
   positively, as every believer should. Nor does he say, "We shall be."
   There are privileges reserved for the future, but here he is speaking
   of a present blessing, which may be now the object of distinct definite
   knowledge, which ought to be, indeed, a matter of present experimental
   enjoyment. We are brought nigh. What means he by this? Does not he
   mean, first, what I have already said, that as we were far off, being
   Gentiles, and not of the favoured commonwealth of Israel, we are now
   brought nigh, that is to say, we have all the privileges of the once
   favoured race. Are they the seed of Abraham? So, are we. for he was the
   Father of the faithful, and we, having believed, have become his
   spiritual children. Had they an altar? We have an altar whereof they
   have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. Had they any high
   priest? We have an high priest we have one who has entered into the
   heavenly. Had they a sacrifice and paschal supper? We have Christ
   Jesus, who, by his one offering, hath for ever put away our sin, and
   who is to-day the spiritual meat on which we feed. All that they had we
   have, only we have it in a fuller and clearer sense. "The law was given
   by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," and they have come
   to us. But we are brought a great deal nearer than the Jew--than most
   of the Jews were, for you know, brethren, the most devout Jew could not
   offer sacrifice to God; I mean, as a rule. Prophets were exceptions.
   They could not offer sacrifices themselves; they could bring the
   victim, but there were some special persons who must act as priests.
   The priest came nigh to God on the behalf of the people. Listen, O ye
   children of God, who were once afar off! It is the song of heaven. Let
   it be your song on earth--"Thou wast slain and hast redeemed us unto
   God by thy blood, and hath made us priests and kings." We are all
   priests if we love the Saviour. Every believer is a priest. It is for
   him to bring his sacrifice of prayer, and thanksgiving, and come in,
   even into the holy place in the presence of the Most High. And I might
   say more, for no priest went into the most holy place of all, save one,
   the high priest, and he once in the year, not without blood and not
   without smoke and of incense, ventured into the most holy place. Be we,
   brethren, see the veil taken right away, and we come up to the
   mercy-seat without the trembling which the high priest felt of old, for
   we see the blood of Jesus on the mercy-seat and the veil rent, and we
   come, boldly to the throne of heavenly grace to obtain grace to help in
   time of need. Oh! how near we are; nearer than the ordinary Jew; nearer
   than the priest; as near as the high priest himself, for in the person
   of Christ we are where he is, that is, at the throne of God. Let me
   say, dear brethren, that we are near to God today, for all that divides
   us from God is gone. The moment a sinner believes, all that mountain of
   sin ceases to be. Can you see those hills--those towering Andes? Who
   shall climb them? But lo! I see one come who has the soar of one that
   has died upon a cross. I see him hold up his pierced hand, and one drop
   of blood falls on the hills, and they smoke; they dissolve like the fat
   of rams; they burn to vapour, and they are gone. There is not so much
   as a vestige of them left. Oh! glory be to God, there is no sin in
   God's book against the believer; there is no record remaining; he hath
   taken it away and nailed it to his cross, and triumphed in the deed. As
   the Egyptians were all drowned in the sea, and Israel said, "The depths
   have covered them; there was not one of them left," so may every
   believer say," All sin is gone, and we are pure, accepted in the
   Beloved, justified through the blood and righteousness of Jesus
   Christ." Oh! how glorious this nearness is when all distance is gone!

   And now, brethren, we are near to God, for we are his friends. He is
   our mighty friend, and we love him in return. Better than that, we are
   his children. A friend might be forgotten, but a child--a father's
   bowels yearn towards him. We are his children. He has chosen us that we
   may approach unto him, that we may dwell in his courts and abide, and
   go no more out for ever." The servant abideth not in the house for
   ever, but the son abideth ever." And this is our privilege. And yet
   even more than that. Can anybody here imagine how near Jesus Christ is
   to God, So near are we, for that is truth which the little verse
   sings:--

   "So near--so very near to God,

   More near I cannot be;

   For in the person of his Son

   I am as near as he."

   If we are, indeed, in Christ, we are one with him: we are members of
   his body, of his flesh, and of his bones; and he has said, "Where I am,
   there shall also my servants be," and he has declared that we shall
   receive the glory--the glory which he had with the Father before the
   world was. What nearness is this!

   Now I have stated that truth, I want you now to feed on it for a
   minute, and draw the natural conclusions, and feel the fit emotion.
   Beloved, if you are brought so near to God, what manner of lives ought
   you to lead? Common subjects ought never to speak traitorous word, but
   a member of the Privy Council, one who is admitted to the Court, should
   certainly be loyal through and through. Oh! how we ought to love God,
   who has made us nigh!--a people near unto him. How ought heavenly
   things and holy things to engross our attention! How joyously we ought
   to live too, for with such high favours as these it would be ungrateful
   to be unhappy! We are near to God, brethren. Then God sees us in all
   things--our heavenly Father knows what we have need of; he is always
   watching over us for good. We are near to him--let us pray as if we
   were near God. There are some prayers that are dreadful from the
   distance there is evidently in the mind of the offerer. Too generally
   liturgies are addresses to a God too far off to be reached, but the
   humble familiarity which boldly comes trembling with fear, but
   rejoicing with faith, into the presence of God--this becomes those who
   are made nigh. When a man is near a neighbour whom he trusts he tells
   him his griefs, he asks his help. Deal thus with God; live on him, live
   for him, live in him. Be never distant from a God who has made you nigh
   unto himself. Our life ought to be a heavenly one, seeing that we are
   brought nigh to God--the God of heaven. Brethren, how assured every one
   of us may be of our safety if we are, indeed, believers in Christ, for
   if we are made nigh by love and friendship to our God, he cannot leave
   us. If, when we were enemies, he brought us nigh, will he not keep us
   now he has made us friends? He loved us so as to bring us up from the
   depths of sin, when we had no thoughts, nor desires towards good, and
   now he has taught us to love him and to long for him, will he forsake
   us? Impossible! What confidence this doctrine gives!

   And once more, dear brethren and sisters, if the Lord has brought us
   nigh, what hope we ought to have for those who are farthest off from
   God to-day! Never be you amongst that pharisaical crew who imagine that
   fallen women or degraded men cannot be uplifted again. Ye were
   sometimes far off, but he has made you nigh. The distance was so great
   in your case that surely he who met that can also meet the distance in
   another case. Have hope for any who can be got under the sound of the
   gospel, and labour on until the more hopeless, the most hopeless, are
   brought there. Oh! let us gird up our loins for Christian work!
   believing that if God has saved us, there remain no impossibles. The
   chief of sinners was saved years ago. Paul said so. He had no mock
   modesty. I believe he said the truth The chief of sinners has gone
   through the gate into heaven, and there is room for the second worst to
   get through--there is room for thee, friend, as there is room for me.
   The God that brought me nigh has taught me to know that no man is
   beyond the reach of his grace. But I must leave that with you, hoping
   that it will flavour all your thoughts to-night. Once more. The last
   thing we are to consider is:--

   III. HOW THE GREAT CHANGE WAS WROUGHT.

   We were put into Christ, and then through the blood we were made nigh.
   The doctrine of the Atonement is no novelty in this house. We have
   preached it often, nay, we preach it constantly, and let this mouth be
   dumb when it prefers any other theme to that old, old story of the
   passion, the substitution, and consequent redemption by blood. Beloved,
   it is the blood of Jesus that has done everything for us. Our debts
   Christ has paid; therefore, those debts have ceased to be. The
   punishment of our sin Christ has borne and, therefore, no punishment is
   due to us; substitution has met a case that is never to be met by any
   other means. The just has suffered for the unjust to bring us to God.
   We deserved the sword, but it has fallen upon him who deserved it not,
   who voluntarily placed himself in our room instead, that he might give
   compensation to justice and full liberty to mercy. It is by the blood
   that we are brought nigh then. Christ has suffered in our stead, and we
   are, therefore, forgiven. But think about that blood a minute. It means
   suffering; it means a life surrendered with agony. Suffering--we talk
   about it; ah! but when you feel it, then you think more of the Saviour.
   When the bones ache, when the body is racked, when sleep goes from the
   eyelids, when the mind is depressed, when the head turns; ah! then we
   say, "My Saviour, I see a little of the price that redeemed me from
   going down into the pit." The mental and physical suffering of Christ
   are both worthy of our consideration, but depend upon it his soul's
   sufferings were the soul of his sufferings; and when we are under deep
   depression, brought near even unto death with sorrow, then again we
   guess how the Saviour bought us. The early Church was noted in its
   preaching for preaching facts. I am afraid now that we are too noted
   for forgetting facts and preaching doctrine. Let us have doctrine by
   all means, but, after all the fact is the great thing. When Paul gave a
   summary of the gospel which he triad preached, he said, "This is the
   gospel that I have preached--that Jesus Christ was crucified, died, was
   buried, rose again." There in Gethsemane, where bloody sweat bedews the
   soil; there on the pavement, where the lash tears again and again into
   those blessed shoulders till the purple streams gush down, and the
   ploughers make their furrows, and the blood fills them; there when they
   hurl him on his back to the ground, and fasten his hands to the wood
   with rough iron; there when they lift him up and dislocate his bones,
   when they fix the gross into the earth; there when they sit and watch
   him, and insult his prayers, and mock his thirst, while he hangs naked
   to his shame in the midst of a ribald crew; there where God himself
   forsakes him, where Jehovah turns his face away from him, where the
   sufferer shrieks in agony, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
   me?"--there it is that we were brought nigh, even we that were far off.
   Adore your Saviour, my brethren--bow before him. He is not here. for he
   is risen; but your hearts can rise, and you can bow at his feet. Oh!
   kiss those wounds of his; ask that by faith you may put your finger
   into the print of his nails, and your hand into his side. "Be not
   faithless, but believing," and let all your sacred powers of mind
   assist your imagination and faith to realise now the price with which
   the Saviour brought you from a bondage intolerable. God grant you grace
   to feel something of this.

   I have laid the truth before you. Now sit down and quietly turn it over
   in your mind. And what will strike you? Why, surely first the
   heinousness of sin. Was there nothing that could wash out sin but
   blood, and was there no blood that could wash it out hut the blood of
   the Son of God? O sin! O sin! what a black, what a damning thing thou
   art! Only the blood of an incarnate God can wash out the smallest stain
   of sin. My heart, I charge thee to hate it; my eyes, look not on it; my
   ears, listen not to its siren charm; my feet, run not in its paths; my
   hands, refuse to handle it; my soul, loathe, loathe that which murdered
   Christ, and thrust a spear through the tenderest heart that ever beat.

   Next to that, do you not feel emotions of intense gratitude that, if
   such a price was needed, such a price was found? God had but one son,
   dearer to him than Isaac was to Abraham, and though there was none to
   command him to do it, as there was in Abraham's case, yet voluntarily
   the gracious Father led his son up to the cross. and it pleased the
   Father to bruise, him; he put him to grief; he gave him up for us.
   Which shall I most admire--the love of the Father, or the love of tile
   Son? Blessed be God, we are not asked to make distinctions, for they
   are one. "I and my Father are one," and in that sacred act of the
   sacrifice for the sins of men the Father and the Son are both to be
   worshipped with equal love. You see, then, the heinousness of sin in
   some degree, for its needing for its pardon the love of Jesus, and the
   love of God that gave the Saviour's blood.

   But, dear friends, ere I sit down, let me remark that we learn from our
   text and from the whole contemplation. what it is that would bring us
   nearer experimentally than we are to-night. How did I get nigh first?
   Through the blood. Do I want to get near to God to-night? Have I been
   wandering? Is my heart cold? Have I got into a backsliding state? Do I
   want to come close now to my blessed Father, and again to look up to
   him, and say, " Abba," and rejoice in that filial spirit? There is no
   way for me to come nearer except the blood. Let me think of it then,
   and let me see' its infinite value; it is sufficient, let me hear its
   everlasting, ever-prevalent plea, and oh! then I shall feel my soul
   drawn; for that which draws us nearer to God, and will draw us right up
   to heaven, is none other than the crimson cord Of the Saviour's
   endless, boundless, dying, but ever-living love.

   And this teaches me, and teaches you, too, and here I have done, what
   it is we ought to preach and teach if we would bring the, far-off ones
   in--if we would bring near to God those that now wander from him.
   Philosophy, bah! You will philosophize men into hell, but never into
   heaven. Ceremonies you can amuse children, and you can degrade men into
   idiots with them, but you can do nothing else. The gospel, and the
   essence of that gospel, which is the blood of Jesus Christ--it is this
   which is an omnipotent leverage to uplift the filth, debauchery, and
   poverty of this city into life, into light, and into holiness. There is
   no battering-ram that will ever shake the gates of hell except that
   which every time it strikes sounds this word, "Jesus, Jesus, the
   Crucified." "God forbid that we should glory, save in the cross of our
   Lord Jesus Christ." If it will save us, it will save others; only let
   us spread the good news, let us tell the good tidings. Every one of us
   ought to preach the gospel somehow. You that speak in common
   conversation forget not to speak of him. Scatter such tracts as are
   most full of Christ--they are the best; others will be of little use.
   Write letters concerning him. Remember his name is like ointment, full
   of sweetness, but to get the perfume you must pour it forth. Oh! that
   we could make fragrant all this neighbourhood with the savour of that
   dear name! Oh! that wherever we dwell every one of us might so think of
   Christ in our hearts that we could not help speaking of him with our
   lips! Living, may we rejoice in him; dying, may we triumph in him. May
   our last whisper on earth be what our first song shall be in heaven,
   "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain and hath redeemed us unto God by his
   blood." Oh! I pray God to make this season of communion very sweet to
   you, and I think it will be if you have the key of our meditation
   to-night, and can unlock the door--if you know how far off you were,
   and see how near you are by the precious blood.

   Oh! there are some far-off ones here to-night, however, to whom I must
   say just this word. Far-off one, God can make you nigh; you can be made
   nigh to-night. Whoever you may be, he is able still to save, but the
   blood must make you nigh--the blood of Jesus. Trust him. To believe is
   to live, and to believe means only and simply to trust, to depend upon.
   That is faith. Have confidence in Christ's sacrifice, and you are
   saved. God grant you may be enabled to do it, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

                                A Solemn Embassy

   A Sermon

   (No. 3497)

   Published on Thursday, February 3rd, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [5]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, 26th February, 1871.

   "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you
   by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."--2
   Corinthians 5:20.

   THERE has long been war between man and his Maker. Our federal head,
   Adam, threw down the gauntlet in the garden of Eden. The trumpet was
   heard to ring through the glades of Paradise, the trumpet which broke
   the silence of peace and disturbed the song of praise. From that day
   forward until now there has been no truce, no treaty between God and
   man by nature. Man has been at variance with God. His heart has been at
   enmity towards God. He would not be reconciled to God. Never in the
   heart of any natural man, unless divine grace has put it there, has a
   desire to re-establish peace been felt or entertained. If any of you
   long to be at peace with your Maker, it is because his spirit has made
   you long for it. Left to yourselves, you would go from conflict to
   conflict, from struggle to struggle, and perpetuate the encounter,
   until it ended in your eternal destruction. But though man will not
   make terms with God, nor sue for peace at his hands, God shows his
   unwillingness any longer to be at war with man. That he anxiously
   desires man to be reconciled unto him, he proves by taking the first
   step. He, himself, sends his ambassadors. He does not invite them from
   the other party--that were grace--but he sends ambassadors, and he
   commands those ambassadors to be very earnest, and to plead with men,
   to pray them, to beseech them that they would be reconciled to God. I
   take this to be a sure pledge that there is love in the heart of God.
   Why, at the very announcement of these tidings, the rebellious sinner's
   ears should be opened! It were enough to make him say, "I will hearken
   diligently; I will hear what God the Lord shall speak, for if it be
   true that he takes the first step towards me, and that he is willing to
   make up this deadly quarrel, God forbid that I should turn away; I will
   even now hear and attend to all that God shall speak to my soul. "May
   he bless the message to you, that you may be reconciled to him without
   a moment's delay. John Bunyan puts it plainly enough." If a certain
   king be besieging a town, and he sends out the herald with a trumpet to
   threaten the inhabitants that, if they do not give up the town, he will
   hang every man of them, then straightway they come to the walls and
   give him back a reviling answer; they swear that they will fight it
   out, and will never surrender to such a tyrant. But if he sends an
   embassage with a white flag to tell them that, if they will but
   surrender and yield to their lawful king, he will pardon every one of
   them, even the very vilest of them will relent." Then, saith honest
   John, "do they not come trembling over the walls, and throw their gates
   wide open to receive their gracious monarch." Would that such a result
   might be accomplished to-night! While I speak of the great grace of
   this Prince of Peace, who now sends his ambassadors to the rebellious,
   may some rebel say, "Then I will be at peace with him; I will hold out
   no longer. So irresistible a love as this has dissolved my heart,
   resolved my choice, and constrained my allegiance."

   Well now, let us speak awhile of the Ambassadors--the Commission with
   which they are entrusted--the duty they have to discharge--and close
   with a question--What then? First, then, we have to speak of:--

   I. THE AMBASSADORS.

   Welcome messengers are they! All nations, with one accord, have agreed
   to honour ambassadors. Strange, then, that all nations and all people
   should have conspired to dishonour the ambassadors of God! Which of
   God's ambassadors in the olden time was not persecuted, rejected, or
   slain? Were they not stoned, beheaded, sawn asunder? How continually
   they were maltreated, and made to wander about in sheep-skins and
   goat-skins, though of them the world was not worthy! But there have
   been some men to whom the ambassadors of God have always been welcome.
   The men whom God had ordained to eternal life. Those on whose behalf,
   from before all worlds, he had made an effectual covenant of peace.
   From them the ambassadors get a hearty welcome. Standing here to preach
   as an ambassador, I shall get but little attention from some of my
   audience. The proclamation of mercy will sound commonplace to many.
   They will turn on their heel and say, "There is nothing in it." But
   mark you, the ambassador of God will be very welcome to some of you,
   who have bitterly felt your estrangement, to some whose hearts are
   prepared by a sense of ruin for the good tidings of redemption; to some
   in whom the secret mystery of predestination begins to work by the
   overt energy of effectual calling. These shall find their souls greatly
   but surely drawn to the proclamation of mercy that shall be made, and
   they will say, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them
   that bring glad tidings of peace, that publish salvation!"

   Ambassadors are always specially welcome to a people who are engaged in
   a war which is beyond their strength, when their resources are
   exhausted, and the peril of defeat is imminent. If some tiny little
   principality has ventured to rebel against a great empire, when it is
   absolutely certain that its villages will be consumed, its provinces,
   ravaged, and that all its power will be crushed, ambassadors are pretty
   sure to receive a cordial welcome. Ah! man, thou best bid defiance to
   the King of Heaven, whose power is irresistible; by whom rocks are
   thrown down; whose voice breaketh the cedars of Lebanon; whose hand
   controlleth the great deep sea. He it, is who bindeth the clouds with a
   cord, and girdleth the earth with a belt! Angels that excel in strength
   cannot stand against him. From the lofty battlements of heaven he
   hurled down Satan, the great archangel, and the mighty host of
   rebellious morning stars! How canst thou stand against him; shall the
   stubble contend with the fire? Shall the potter's vessel resist the rod
   of iron? What art thou but a moth, easily crushed beneath his finger!
   The breath is in thy nostrils, and that is not thine own; how then
   canst thou, poor mortal, contend with him who only hath immortality?
   With art thou but a moth, easily crushed beneath his finger! Thy breath
   broken more rapidly than a sear leaf by the wind! How canst thou
   venture to be at war with one who has heaven and earth at his command,
   who holds the keys of hell and of death, and who has Tophet as his
   source of ammunition against thee? Listen to his thunders, and let thy
   blood curdle! Let his lightning flash, and how art thou amazed! How,
   then, canst thou stand against the greatness of his power, or endure
   the terror of his wrath? Happy for thee that terms of peace are
   proclaimed in your ears. God is willing to cease the warfare; he would
   not have thee be his adversary. Wilt thou not gladly accept what he
   proposeth to thee? Never, surely, was war more charged with disaster
   than that into which thou hast madly rushed.

   An ambassador is always welcome when the people have begun to feel the
   victorious force of the king. Yonder province has already yielded.
   Certain cities have been taken by the sword and given up to be sacked.
   Now the poor miserable inhabitants are glad enough to get peace. They
   dread the foot of the conqueror now that they have felt its weight.
   Doubtless there are some here present who have known the power of God
   in their conscience. Perhaps he has soared you with visions, and
   frightened you with dreams. Though it be but the voice of a man that
   you heard, yet the law has been very terrible to you, and now you find
   no pleasure in your pleasure; no joy in your joys. God has begun to
   break your bones with conviction; he has made you feel that sin is a
   bitter thing; he has made you drunken with wormwood, and broken your
   teeth with gravel stones. He has brought you down as the fool in the
   hundred and seventh Psalm, by affliction and by labour, and you are
   crying out in anguish, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" Ay, doubtless,
   you that have once felt the weight of God's hand upon your conscience,
   will rejoice to hear that there is an embassage of peace sent to you.

   An ambassador is likewise always welcome to those who are labouring
   under a few of total and speedy destruction. If none of you are in that
   plight, I remember when I was, when I thought every day it was a marvel
   of mercies that I was kept alive, and wondered as I woke at morn that I
   was not lifting up my eyes with Dives in hell. Everything about Christ
   was precious to me then! I think I would have stood in the most crowded
   chapel, nor would I have been weary had I sat upon the hardest seat; no
   length of service would have wearied me, might I but have had an
   inkling that God would peradventure have mercy upon my soul. My eyes
   were full of tears. My soul was faint with watching, and I would have
   kissed the feet of any man who would have told me the way of salvation.
   But, alas! it seemed as if no man cared for my soul, till at last God
   blessed an humble instrument to give light to his poor dark child.
   Hence I know that the news of mercy will be exceedingly welcome to you
   who stand upon the jaws of hell, fearing that the gates will soon be
   bolted upon you, and that you will be for ever lost. You will be ready
   to cry like our Methodist friends, "Hallelujah! Glory! Hallelujah!
   Bless the Lord!" whilst you hear that God still sends an embassage of
   peace to your soul.

   Most acceptable, too, is a messenger of peace if the people know that
   he brings no hard terms. When a certain king sent to the inhabitants of
   a town that he would make peace with them, provided he put out their
   right eyes and cut off their right hands, I am sure the tidings must
   have caused the utmost consternation, and the ambassador could not be
   very popular. But there are no hard terms in the gospel. In fact, there
   are no terms, no conditions at all. It is an unconditional peace which
   God makes with men. It is a gospel which asks nothing of men, but gives
   them everything. The Lord saith, "My oxen and my fatlings are killed;
   all things are ready, come ye to the supper." There is nothing for man
   to get ready; all things are prepared. The terms--if I must use a word
   I do not like--are simple and easy. "Believe, and live." With what joy
   should a rebellious sinner hear the voice of the ambassador who brings
   no hard conditions from God.

   And should not the fame of the King increase the zest with which the
   embassage is received? Comes it not from him who cannot lie! No
   temporary peace is proposed that may presently be broken, but a peace
   that shall stand fast for ever and ever. No temporary armistice, no
   brief interlude between the deeds of battle do we herald. Peace;
   eternal, unbroken peace; peace that shall endure in life and outlive
   death; peace which shall endure throughout eternity, we testify and
   make known to you.

   This peace is proclaimed to all men. It is proclaimed without
   exception." Whosoever believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ shall be
   saved." None are excluded hence but those who do themselves exclude.
   Such an ambassador bringing such a message must surely be a welcome
   messenger from his God. Let us ask now, What is:--

   II. THE COMMISSION OF PEACE which God has entrusted us to proclaim? The
   words are concise, the sense is transparent." To wit, that God was in
   Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespass
   unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. "Let
   us open the commission. It lies in a nutshell." Thus saith the Lord of
   Hosts, As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of
   him that dieth, but had rather that he should turn unto me and live."
   "Come now, let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be
   as scarlet they shall be as wool, though they be red like crimson they
   shall be whiter than snow. Our commission begins with the announcement
   that God is love, that he is full of pity and compassion, that he is
   desirous to receive his creature back, that he willeth to forgive, and
   that he electeth, if it be consistent with the high attribute of his
   justice, to accept even the most rebellious, and to put them amongst
   his children. Our commission goes on to disclose the manner, as well as
   the motive, of mercy. Inasmuch as God is love, he, in order to remove
   all difficulties in the way of pardoning rebels, has been pleased to
   give his only begotten Son that he might stand in the room, place, and
   stead of those whom God has chosen; their sins he engaged to take; to
   carry their sorrows, and to make an atonement on their behalf. Thus the
   justice of God should be satisfied, and his love flow over to the human
   race. We declare, therefore, that God has given Christ, and he has made
   it a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that he came into
   the world to save sinners, even the very chief. Christ, the Son of God,
   has become man. Cheerfully and willingly he took upon himself our
   nature; veiled the form of Deity in a humble garb of clay; was born of
   the Virgin Mary, lived a life of holiness, and died a death of
   sacrifice. Through this marvellous death of the Man, the God, Christ
   Jesus, God is at peace with his people. The peace is made already, for
   he is our peace. God is at peace with every man for whom Jesus died.
   Jesus Christ stood in the room, place, and steed of his chosen people.
   Christ was punished for their sins. Justice cannot punish twice for one
   offense. Christ, the substitute, being punished, the sinner cannot be
   amenable for his own offences. Those for whom Jesus died go free. The
   proclamation is that God is willing to be reconciled, that he is
   reconciled. It is an announcement, not that you may have peace merely,
   but that peace is made with God by Jesus Christ for you--full peace,
   without condition, not half-made, but wholly made; the penalty being
   completely paid to the last doit, and the sacrifice completely
   slaughtered till the last drop of blood had expiated the last offence.

   But the proclamation needs something more to give us any satisfaction.
   Are there any tidings in it for you and me? Well, our message goes on
   to announce that whosoever in the wide world will come to Jesus Christ,
   and commit his cause to him as Redeemer, Saviour, and Friend, shall
   forthwith be at peace with God, receive full pardon for all offences,
   and be welcomed as a favourite of the Most High. He shall know that for
   him Jesus Christ did die in his stead, and as surety did stand for him
   when he appeared before God. From condemnation he is, therefore, free;
   of salvation he is, therefore, sure. This proclamation, I say, is to be
   made universally. Though every man will not be blessed by it, the
   preacher cannot discriminate between those who must and those who will
   not inherit the blessing. Though only some will accept it, the preacher
   is not warranted in showing any partiality. It is the Holy Spirit's
   work to impress the Word on the conscience, and to arouse the
   conscience by the Word. As for us, we are willing enough to turn our
   face to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west. Gladly
   would we proclaim it to the red man who hunts the savannahs of America,
   to the swarthy man who never heard the name of Christ before, or to the
   white man who has often heard, but never heeded it. The same message,
   that God has accepted Christ as a substitute for every man that will
   believe in Christ, and that whosoever trusts Christ to save him is in
   that moment saved, will suffice for all. Yea, we would tell them that
   before the sinner does trust Christ he is reconciled unto God by his
   death, because the atonement which he offered had been accepted, and
   there was peace forestalled between God and that sinner. What a message
   I have to present! What a proclamation I have to make! Nothing is
   necessary on your part. God expects nothing of you to merit his esteem,
   or to enhance the value of his gift. If repentance be indispensable, he
   is prepared to give it to you. If a tender heart be needed, he is ready
   to give you a heart of flesh. If you feel that you have a heart of
   stone, be has engaged to take it away. Does your guilt oppress you, he
   says, "I will sprinkle clean water, water of pure fountains, upon them,
   and they shall be cleansed from all their filthiness, and from all
   their uncleanness will I save them." Know, all men, that there is no
   exception made. When Charles II came back to England there was an
   amnesty, except for certain persons, and these were mentioned by
   name--Hugh Peters and others were proscribed; but there is no exception
   here. I find not any traitors singled out and denounced by name. I have
   to proclaim an indemnity of such universal import that it is
   indiscriminate, "Whosoever believeth on him shall never perish, but
   shall have everlasting life."

   Moreover, there is no exception made in my commission to any form of
   sin--unless it be the sin against the Holy Ghost--which carries its own
   evidence as well as its consequence. Those to whom I now speak, if they
   feel any drawings of heart towards God have not committed that mortal
   crime. Murder, theft, forgery, felony, fornication, adultery, and
   covetousness, which is idolatry--black and hideous as is the
   catalogue--here is pardon for the whole. Ransack the kennels, however
   filthy; rake the slums, however odious; drag out the abominations of
   the age, however degrading; here is pardon not only possible, probable,
   but positive. Bring a man here who has stained himself crimson all over
   with every sort of infamy, though it be not the lapse of an hour, but
   the habit of a life, yet God is still able to forgive. Jesus Christ is
   able to save to the uttermost them that come unto God by him.

   I do not know whether you find it very good to hear the proclamation,
   but I do know that I feel it most gratifying to utter it. Thrice happy
   am I to have such an announcement to make to rebels. Unwonted hearers,
   listen to my voice. By what strange chance have yon reckless, heedless,
   unconverted souls mingled with this throng of worshippers? Not often do
   you darken the floor of a place of worship. You hardly know how you
   were led to come in hither. To what depths of sin you have run, to what
   extremities of iniquity you have gone! You marvel to find yourself in
   the company of God's people. But since you are here, give heed to the
   message," Thus saith the Lord, I have blotted out like a cloud thine
   iniquities, and like a thick cloud thy sins. Return unto me, for I am
   married unto thee. I have given my blood to redeem thee. Return, O
   wandering child of man; return, return, and I will have mercy upon
   thee, for I am God, and not man." Having thus opened my commission, I
   will endeavour to perform:--

   III. A VERY SOLEMN DUTY.

   My text supplies me with a warrant. It says, "As though God did beseech
   you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled unto God."
   Then it seems we have not merely to read our commission, but we have to
   beseech you to accept it. Why should we beseech you? Is it not because
   you are rational creatures, not automata, men not machines. A machine
   might be compelled to perform functions without persuasion, but the
   Spirit of God often acts upon the heart of man by the sound arguments
   and affectionate entreaties of his servants whom he commissions. We are
   to beseech you because your hearts are so hard that you are prone to
   defy God's power, and resist his grace. Therefore, we pray you to put
   down your weapons. We are to beseech you because you are unbelieving,
   and will not credit the tidings. You say it is too good to be true that
   God will have mercy on such as you are. Therefore, we are to put our
   hand on you, to go down on our knees to you, and to beseech you not to
   put away this blessed embassy. We are to beseech you because you are so
   proud and self-satisfied that you will sooner follow your own
   righteousness and cling to your own works, than accept a peace already
   and freely proffered to you. We are to beseech you because you are
   careless. You give little heed to what is spoken: you will go your way
   and forget all our proclamations; therefore, are we to press you
   urgently, instantly, importunately, And to beseech you as when a mother
   pleadeth for her child's life, as when a condemned criminal beseeches
   the judge to have pity on him, so are we to beseech you. I think I
   never feel so conscious of my own weakness as when I have to ply you
   thus with exhortations. Oh! there have been a few times in my ministry
   when I could with flowing eyes beseech you to be reconciled to God, but
   these dry eyes of mine are not so often fountains of tears as I could
   wish. We need such an one as Richard Baxter to dilate upon this last
   part of the text. Perhaps we could handle the former part better than
   he, but he could handle this last far better than we can. Oh! how he
   would have summoned you by the terrible reality of things to come! With
   what glaring eyes and seething words he would say, "Oh! men, turn ye,
   turn ye, why will ye die? By the need of a Saviour you will feel in the
   pangs of parting life, when the pulsings shall be few and feeble, till
   with a gasp you shall expire; by the resurrection when you will wake
   up, if not in his likeness, to everlasting shame and contempt; by the
   judgment-seat, where your sins shall be published, and you shall be
   called to account for the deeds done in the body; by the dread decree
   which casteth into the pit for ever those that repent, not; by the
   heaven you will lose:, and by the hell into which you will fall; by
   eternity, that dread eternity whose years never waste; by the wrath to
   come, the burning indignation of which shall never cool; by the
   immortality of your own souls, by the perils you now run, by the
   promises you despise, by the provocations you multiply, by the
   penalties you accumulate, we do beseech you to be reconciled to God."
   Fly to Jesus. Call upon his name. Trust him; his word; his work, his
   goodness and his grace. This is the way of reconciliation. Bow the knee
   and kiss the Son. We do conjure you to do so. Acquaint yourselves now
   with God, and be at peace with him. My text bangs like a crushing
   weight upon my soul at this moment. It is awful in its grandeur, and it
   is majestically full of divine love. I must read the words again in
   your hearing. Oh! that the sense might break in on your understanding!

   We are to beseech you as though God did beseech you, and we to do it in
   Christ's stead. You see God speaks when his ambassadors speak. I
   wonder, oh! I wonder, whether I have brain enough to compass the
   thought of how God would beseech you to be reconciled! 'Tis the
   Father's own self-pleading with his prodigal son. Can you imagine the
   father in the parable going after his son, and finding him in rags
   feeding swine? Can you conceive him saying, "My son, my dear son, come
   back! come back and I will forgive you all!" You think you hear that
   son saying to his father "Get you gone, I will not hear of it", till
   his father says "My dear son, why will you prefer the company of swine
   to your father's house? Why will you wear rags when you might be
   clothed in the best robe? Why will you starve in a far-off country when
   my house shall be full of feasting on your return?" What if that son
   should utter some indignant word, and tell his father to his face he
   never would go back! Oh! I think I see the venerable, loving man
   falling on his son's neck and kissing him, in his filth just as he is
   (for "the great love wherewith he loved us when we were dead in
   trespasses and sins!")--and he says to the rebel that insults him and
   resents his tenderness, "My dear son, you must come back; I must have
   you; I cannot be without you. I must have you; come back!" In such a
   style we ought to plead with men. Ah! then, I cannot plead with you as
   I would. As though God himself, your offended Maker, came to you now as
   he did to Adam in the cool of the day, and said to you, "Oh! return to
   me, for I have loved thee with an everlasting love," even so, as though
   God spoke, would I woo you, ye chiefest sinners, to return to him. You
   know, dear friends, that the great God did send another ambassador, and
   that great ambassador was Christ. Now the Apostle says that we, the
   ministers, are ambassadors for Christ in Christ's stead. Christ is no
   more an ambassador; he has gone to heaven; we stand in his stead to the
   sons of men, not to make peace, but to proclaim it. What! am I then to
   speak in Christ's stead! But how can I picture my Lord Jesus standing
   here? Alas, my imagination is not equal to the task. Would that I had
   sympathy enough with him to put myself in his case so as to use his
   words. Methinks I see him looking at this great throng as once he
   looked at the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He turns his head round to
   these galleries, and about on yonder aisles, and at last he bursts into
   a flood of tears, saying, "How often would I have gathered thy children
   together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would
   not." He is choked with tears, and when he has paused a moment, he
   cries, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest; take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and
   lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls; a bruised reed
   I will not break, nor quench the smoking flax."

   Again, I think I see him, as he looks at you again, and when he
   observes some hearts so obdurate and hard that they will not melt, he
   unwraps his mantle, and exclaims, "See here." Do you mark the gash in
   his side? As he lifts his hands and shows the nail-prints, and points
   downward to his pierced feet, he says, "By these, my wounds, which I
   endured when suffering for you, O my people, return unto me; come, bow
   at my feet, and take the peace which I have wrought out for you. Oh! be
   not faithless, but believing! Doubt no longer! God is reconciled!
   Tremble no more! Peace is established. Toil no more at the works of the
   law, cling not to your own doings. Cease to consult your feelings. It
   is finished. When I bowed my head upon the tree, I finished all for
   you. Take salvation: take it now! Come to me; come now to me just as
   you are." Alas! this is but a poor representation of my Lord and
   Master. I could wish myself laid among the clods of the valley,
   sleeping in my grave, rather than that I should be so poor an
   ambassador. But, Lord, wherefore didst thou choose thy servant, and why
   givest thou this people still to hear his voice, if thou wilt not more
   mightily enable him to plead with men. I have no more words, oh! let
   these, tears plead with you. I feel that I could freely give my life if
   it would avail for the saving of your souls. Fain would I meet a
   martyr's death, if you would be persuaded thereby to come to Christ,
   for life. But oh! sinners, no pleading of mine will ever prevail if the
   pleading of Christ prove ineffectual with you. To each one of you, a
   distinct proclamation of salvation is addressed. Whosoever among you
   will believe that Christ died, and that he is able to save you, and
   will trust your soul upon what he did, shall be saved. Oh! why reject
   him? He will not hurt nor harm you. Do lay hold of this good hope, for
   your time is short! Death is hastening on; eternity is near! Do lay
   hold of it, for hell is hot, the, flames thereof are terrible! Lay hold
   of it, for heaven is bright, and the harps of angels are sweet beyond
   compare! Lay hold of it. It shall make your heart glad on earth, it
   shall charm away your fears and remove your griefs! Lay hold of it! It
   shall bear you through Jordan's billows, and land you safe on Canaan's
   side. Oh! by the love of the Father, by the, blood of Jesus, by the
   love of the Spirit, I beseech you, sinner, believe and live! By the
   cross and the five wounds, by the agony and bloody sweat, by the
   resurrection, and by the ascension, sinner, believe and live! By every
   argument that would touch your nature, by every motive that can sway
   your reason or stir your passions, in the name of God that sent me, by
   the Almighty that made you, by the Eternal Son that redeemed you, by
   the gift of the Holy Spirit, sinner, I command you, with divine
   authority to sanction my vehemence, that ye be reconciled to God
   through the death of his Son! And:--

   IV. WHAT THEN?

   When we have answered this question we shall have done. What then? Are
   there not some of you with whom this peace is made at this good hour? I
   will go back and tell my Master so. Then there shall be fresh
   ratifications between you and him. The angels will hear of it, and they
   will strike their harps anew to sweeter lays than they have known
   before.

   Others there are of you that will not be reconciled. I must have an
   answer from you. Do you hesitate? Do you delay? Do you refuse? You
   shall never have another warning, some of you! No tears of pity shall
   be wept for you again; no loving heart shall ever bid you come to
   Christ again must have your answer now. Yes or no. Wilt thou be damned
   or not? Wilt thou be saved or not? I will not have thee say, "When I
   have a more convenient season I will send for thee." Sinner, it cannot
   be a more convenient one than this. This is a convenient place; it is
   God's house. It is a convenient time; it is the Lord's day. Now,
   sinner, wilt thou be reconciled, restored, forgiven? "Wilt thou be made
   whole?" said Jesus, and I say the same to thee, "Wilt thou be made
   whole?" Do you say, "No"? Must I take that for an answer? Mark you,
   sinner, I have to tell my Master must tell him when I seek the closet
   of the King to-night; I must tell him your reply that you would not.
   What then remains for an ambassador to do when he has spoken to you in
   the name of the Sovereign? If you will not turn, we must shake off the
   dust of our feet against you. I am clear, I am clear, of the blood of
   you all, I am clear. If you perish, being warned, you perish wantonly.
   The wrath cometh upon you, not on him who, to the best of his power,
   has told his Master's message. Yet again, I beg you to accept it. Do
   you still say no? The white flag will be pulled down. It has been up
   long enough. Shall I pull it down, and run up the red flag now? Shall I
   hurl threatenings at you because you heed not entreaties?

   "If your ears refuse

   The language of his grace,

   And hearts grow hard like stubborn Jews,

   That unbelieving race,

   The Lord in anger drest,

   Shall lift his trend and swear

   Ye that despised my promised rest

   Shall have no portion there."

   But no, I cannot pull it down, that white flag! My heart will not let
   me do so; it shall fly there still, it shall fly there as a sign and a
   symbol of the day of grace. Mercy is still held out to you. But there
   is one coming--I can hear his footsteps--who will pull down that white
   flag. The vision haunts my eyes. That grim, heartless skeleton whom men
   call Death will rend the white flag from its place, and up will go the
   blood-red flag, with the black escutcheon of the thunderbolts. Where
   are you then, sinners? Where will you be then? You shudder at the
   thought. He lays his hand on you. There is no escape. Oh! turn ye, turn
   ye, turn ye! Come and welcome, sinner, come now while you are welcome.
   'Tis love invites you. Jesus stretches out his hand to you all the day
   long. He has stretched out his hands to a rebellious, and a gainsaying
   generation. Do not say, "I will think of it," but yield to his love who
   around you now the bands of a man doth cast. Do not make a resolution,
   but commit yourself to the good confession. Now, even now, may
   sovereign grace constrain, and irresistible love draw you. May you
   believe with your heart, may you record your profession at once. Before
   you close your eyes in sleep, just as you would wish before your eyes
   are closed in death, may you be at peace with God. I pray God, as I
   entreat you, that this may come to pass, for his Son, Jesus Christ's
   sake. Amen.

                               God's Gentle Power

   A Sermon

   (No. 3498)

   Published on Thursday, February 10th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [6]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, September 10th, 1871.

   "And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the
   mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord
   was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire, but the
   Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. And
   it was so. when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his
   mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And
   behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here,
   Elijah?"--1 Kings 19:11-13.

   ELIJAH was a man of like passions with ourselves. We all know that when
   we have passed through any great excitement of high joy there almost
   always comes following, a corresponding reaction and depression. Elijah
   had gone to the top of Carmel and had pleaded his cause, and the rain
   floods had come in answer to his prayer He had taken the prophets of
   Baal, and had slain them, and gained a glorious victory for his God;
   and so full of excitement was he that he girded his loins as though he
   had been a young man, and ran before the chariot of Ahab, like the
   royal footmen. It was almost inevitable that after an excitement so
   high, and strong, that he should be desponding and depressed in
   spirits, and we find that he was so depressed. If the like should ever
   happen to any of you' my brethren and sisters, count it no strange
   thing, nor suppose that some extraordinary trial hath happened unto
   you. It is but a physical result from physical causes. The mind has
   operated upon the body. It has strung the bow too tightly, and now,
   unless the string be relaxed, there is a danger of its breaking
   altogether. Now as Elias was a man of like passions with us, we may
   conclude that the way in which God dealt with him is very much the way
   in which he would deal with us. With a similar case, and the same
   physician, we may look for the same treatment. As, therefore, the Lord
   spake to Elijah not by earthquake, nor wind, nor fire, but by the still
   small voice, so in all probability will he speak to us. It may be, it
   is just possible it may be, that here to-night there is some worker for
   God very much in the same condition as Elijah. You, my dear brother,
   have been working for God in a neighbourhood where you have met with
   little but opposition and disappointment, and you have almost resolved
   that you will go away from the place. "The soil is hard," you say, "and
   breaks the ploughshare. Shall oxen plough upon a rock?" 'Tis in vain
   for you to continue your labour there, you. think, and you have come
   here to-night still with this thought uppermost--that you have laboured
   in vain, and spent your strength for nought. Hear you the word of the
   Lord this night. He speaks not to you by any earthquake of judgment
   with which he means to visit you, neither by any fiery word of severe
   rebuke; but perhaps through me, this evening, he may speak with a still
   small voice that shall just meet your case and send you back to your
   labour. Brother, will you play the Jonahs Will you refuse to go to tile
   great city--to Nineveh? Remember there are worse places than Nineveh.
   He that goes out of the path that God marks for him may yet come to be
   at the bottom of the sea with Jonah, with the weeds wrapped about his
   head. You go at your own cost, remember, if you go away frown the post
   of duty, however arduous. Don't attempt the risk. But thus saith the
   Lord unto thee, "It may be thou hast not laboured in vain as thou hast
   supposed." Elijah knew nothing of the seven thousand men that God had
   in reserve. You don't know what converts God has given you. There are
   scattered up and down the world--perhaps some precious ones who owe
   their salvation instrumentally to you, and could they all stand before
   you--you would blush with shame at the thought of leaving a
   harvest--field that has really been so prolific, though not in your
   sight. Go back again to thy work, for the Lord has blessed thee. Play
   not the fool by deserting the post where he will give thee honour yet.

   But then the voice told Elijah also that God would punish the people
   who had treated him so ill; that he, would send Hazael with his sharp
   sword and Jehu, yet to mow the ground a second time. And oh! thou true
   servant of God, the Lord will not suffer thee to be rejected. If they
   have rejected thee, they have rejected thy God also. If thou hast been
   faithful to his truth, leave thou that matter to him--go thou back to
   thy work. And one other word there was to Elijah. He was to go back to
   anoint his successor. If Elijah flees, and if Elijah at length is taken
   up to heaven, yet Elisha shall succeed him. Perhaps there may be a
   brother here who is in the state I have described who does not know
   what God has in store for him. You are to call into the Christian
   ministry a brother that shall do greater than you have, you shall light
   as greater candle shall your own. Oh! what joy Elijah must have had
   when he felt there would be someone to take up his work! You have not,
   my dear brother, yet called out for your master the man the Lord means
   to call. What a happy man he must have been who was the means of the
   conversion of Whitefield or Jonathan Edwards, or some great missionary
   of the cross. You may be that, in that little village--in that back
   slum. Go thou back then. What doest thou hero Elijah? What doest thou
   here? With whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? The
   Master's voice speaks to thee. Go to thy closet, and get fresh strength
   from on high, and then go back to thy difficulties--go back to thy
   self-denials, go back to all thy service with a good heart and
   true."Fear not thou worm Jacob; I will help thee, saith the Lord."
   Arise, thou worm, and thresh the mountain, for "I will make thee a new
   sharp threshing instrument having teeth." I have delivered the message.
   It is to somebody, I know not to whom, in this place.

   But now the drift, the great aim of the sermon at this time is to speak
   to the unconverted. With them I dealt also this morning. I feel
   persuaded God will bless it. Now, this evening, let us have another
   word with them. We will read the text again. "Behold, the Lord passed
   by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces
   the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after
   the wind an earthquake. but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and
   after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and
   after the fire a still small voice." Our first observation is that:--

   I. POWERFUL MEANS MAY ALTOGETHER FAIL TO IMPRESS SOME MINDS

   Let us think a while. Terrible judgments appear as if they must convert
   sinners; yet there may be those here, and there certainly are those in
   many places who have passed through a whole series of judgments, and
   are rather hardened than softened by them. You may have been, dear
   friend in a storm of sin; you may have been just barely washed upon a
   rock, and escaped as with the skin of your teeth. You have also passed
   through a time of cholera. You have been in a city smitten with the
   plague. You have lived in a house where others have sickened and died;
   and at those times you did pause a little, and you made some good
   resolutions, but they all ended in smoke; and here you are still, a
   proof that God is not in the earthquake, nor yet in the wind, nor yet
   in the fire. It may be you have suffered a great deal of personal
   sickness. Do I not know some here present who have been laid very low
   with fever--who have been the subjects of very frightful accidents, and
   brought to the borders of the grave? These things were loud voices to
   you, but you did not hear them. They were God's terrors, sent to fetch
   you to himself, but they failed to do it. You remained just where you
   were, perhaps worse instead of better; for when the sun shines on wax,
   it melts it, but if it shines on clay, it hardens it; and so God's
   judgments have had just that effect on you. You are hardened, instead
   of softened by them. Men are not converted by judgments. They may
   submit themselves in a false way, but power and displays of terror do
   not win the heart.

   Again, we naturally expect that men will be converted during the times
   of earnest religious excitement. Some are brought in; but there are
   certain persons who do not seem to be affected by revivals. When others
   bow like the corn that waveth in the wind, they stand stiff and firm,
   and are altogether untouched. It is a solemn thing when a season of
   grace is not a season of grace to us. When we lie, like Gideon's
   fleece, all dry, while all around us is wet with the dew of heaven, yet
   with some it is just so--gracious excitements and spiritual revivals do
   not touch them. The Lord is not in the wind, and the Lord is not in the
   earthquake, and the Lord is not in the fire-at least to them. The same
   is the case with powerful sermons. I do not mean by this "eloquent
   sermons," so called. "Eloquent sermons" usually seem to me to be the
   least eloquent things in the world; for eloquence means speaking from
   the heart; and I cannot believe that the fine periods we sometimes hear
   read ever spring anywhere but from the head. But I mean when a sermon
   is full of gospel truth, when it is pertinently put, when it is
   pathetically urged, when the heart of the preacher is warmed, and his
   eyes o'erflow with tears; when you see a congregation melted, you say
   to yourself, "Surely that must touch so-and-so's heart." And then there
   comes a passage in the sermon that seems so touching that the very
   rocks might weep, and the stones might break; but oh! when it is all
   over it is all over, and it is forgotten too; and to many a hearer the
   Lord is not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire. And so
   it is also in the dealing out of the judgments of God in the ministry.
   It is the duty of the Christian pastor, if he would make full proof of
   his ministry, to warn men of the results of sin--to tell them that
   there is a judgment--that for every idle word they speak they will have
   to account. We ought continually to declare that for every
   transgression there shall be a recompense of reward. But ah! dear
   hearer, though we have read books and heard sermons that were full of
   the terrors of the Lord, which we thought surely would move men, yet
   there are men who care nothing whatever about the wrath to come, nor
   the fire that is kindled for the wicked, nor the dreadful terrors of
   Divine Justice. The Lord is not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor
   in the fire, so far as they are concerned. The means that appear to be
   powerful are powerless to them; and when you think they will surely
   turn and repent, they harden their necks and go on in their sin. This,
   abundant facts could prove.

   But the next observation shall be that sometimes a much gentler force
   effects what could not otherwise have been achieved. Many have been
   converted to God by the still small voice whom no wind, though it rose
   to a hurricane, no earthquake, though it rent the world to its centre,
   and no fire, though it licked up the forests, could ever move. A gentle
   word has done it. Sometimes that still small voice has come to us by
   apparently very, very inadequate means. It is astonishing what little
   things God will use when he pleases to do so. He wanted to soften the
   heart of that rough prophet Jonah, and he sent a worm and a gourd, and
   they did it. He would bring Peter to repentance, and he bade a cock to
   crow. It was a strange preacher, but it was as good as a dean of a
   cathedral to the Apostle. Means may seem to be absolutely ridiculous,
   yet God maketh use of the things that are not, as though they were. I
   remember to have heard the story of a man, a blasphemer, profane, an
   atheist, who was converted singularly by a sinful action of his. He had
   written on a piece of paper, "God is nowhere," and bade his child read
   it, for he would make his child an atheist too. And the child spelt it,
   "God is n-o-w h-e-r-e-God is now here." It was a truth, instead of a
   lie, and the arrow pierced the man's own heart. I remember one who had
   lived a life of gross iniquity who stepped into Exeter Hall and found
   Christ there. It was not my sermon, however, that God blessed: it was
   only this. I read the hymn, "Jesus, lover of my soul." Just those words
   touched his heart. "Jesus, lover of my soul," he said to himself. "Did
   Jesus love my soul? Then how is it that I could have lived as I have
   done?"; and that word broke him down. God works great results by little
   things. A little hymn learnt at the Sunday School is sung at home by a
   little prattler, and the heart of the father is softened by it. One
   little sentence uttered by a friendly visitor reaches a mother's
   conscience and impresses her heart. Ay, and God can use the quiet of
   the evening, or the stillness of the night, or a flash of lightning, or
   a peal of thunder, or a dewdrop, or a little flower--he can use
   anything he wills to bring his banished. home. Often cloth the Spirit
   speak thus with a still small voice.

   But, brethren, beloved, the Holy Ghost also speaks to men without any
   means at all. With no outward agency whatever, the still small voice
   will come. Oh! how I wish it would come to-night to some sitting here
   listening to the preacher! I wish you could forget--forget the
   congregation, and forget everything except yourself and your God. We
   have known persons who have been walking in the fields, thoughtless and
   careless. All around has been still, and they have suddenly thought,
   and thought is often the avenue to prayer. We have known some passing
   through a country churchyard, and though no text upon the tomb how
   touched them, yet the very sight of those green hillocks has been a
   sermon to them. Aye, and men have walked through orchards, and the
   leaves have said to them, "We all do fade as a leaf." Or sitting in
   their chamber, or lying on their bed wakeful, the old times have come
   over again. The man that lives to be an old sinner recollects the
   little prayer he said at his mother's knee. The soldier that has been
   at battle recollects the teaching of the Sunday School, though he has
   passed now his fiftieth year; and he says, "I wish I could blot out all
   that which lies between my mother's kiss and this hour. It has been a
   dark, dark season." Only the thought has done it. God's Spirit did but
   touch the secret spring, and the soul was moved aright. The still small
   voice has done it. Oh! how satisfied I should be if the Lord would not
   give me a single soul in this place by my preaching, if he would but do
   it himself! What matters it so long as they are saved? He does put
   honour upon his preached word, and he brings in the most of men
   thereby; but so long as they are brought in, and he gets glory, what
   will it signify as to the means he uses? May he still speak to you by
   his still small voice. I commend to him in my earnest prayer some of
   you who are very familiar with my voice, and to whom it is as useless
   as familiar. You will never be brought to Christ by me. God will never
   give me your souls I fear. For these many years have I laboured for
   them, and they have not been given me. Well, good Master, call them by
   some other means, only bring then; and grant that this very night,
   conscience may be aroused by thoughts which thou thyself shalt suggest,
   and they may come to thee.

   You see, then, the first two points, that the most powerful means will
   often fail, and that the least means may be successful. Ay, and the
   Holy Ghost may work without means altogether. And now once again:--

   II. WHEN GOD SPEAKS TO MEN, HIS VOICE IS ALWAYS LINKED WITH PERSONAL
   ADDRESS.

   Look at the text. What says the still small voice? "What doest thou
   here Elijah?" There was the man named. It was no general statement
   about prophets who proved faithless, or about believers who grew
   doubtful, or about men of courage that played the coward. Oh! no; it
   was, "What doest thou here, Elijah?" It is a mark of God's Spirit that
   when he speaks to men he speaks to them personally. Just take a case or
   two. You remember Jesus Christ going through Jericho, preaching as he
   went. He meant to call that rich publican who had climbed the tree. In
   what way did the effectual voice of grace do it? He says, "Zaccheus" It
   was not a general observation about people up in trees that were to
   come down; but "Zaccheus"--that is the man. "Zaccheus, make haste and
   come down, for to-day I must abide in thy house." The personal call did
   it. And Mary, when she did not know her Master, and was in the garden,
   and thought he was the gardener--what was it that opened her eyes to
   know her Lord, and made her say, "Rabboni"? It was no word else except
   that he said unto her, "Mary." The tone in which he said it, and the
   name--the old familiar name, Mary--that did the work. And when the
   Saviour meant to break Simon Peter's heart, and yet to assure him that
   he was forgiven, how did he speak to him? Three times he said to him,
   "Simon, son of Jonas. Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" This is how
   God speaks to men. And when out of the open heavens Jesus spake to the
   maddened persecutor who was on the road to Damascus, but whom he meant
   to make his elect apostle to the Gentiles, how did he speak but thus?
   "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick
   against the pricks." Now here I cannot speak except to the crowd and
   the congregation, and though one labours hard to make a description apt
   and plain, and to fit the cap to all wearers' heads, yet men slip
   through in the crowd; they will not take it to themselves, nor can we
   make them. But when the Holy Ghost speaks with the still small voice,
   it is always, "Thou art the man. Thou art the man. Thou art the sinner
   condemned. Thou art the sinner invited to mercy. Thou art the sinner
   that shall be received by grace." Believe thou, and thou shalt be
   saved, for he loves thee and gave himself for thee. May the Lord send
   us such personal work as this. I know every Christian here, if he could
   state his experience, would tell you that the word never came with
   power to his soul until it came right to him as though he were the only
   sinner, and the gospel were meant for him above all others. Oh! for an
   arrow from the great archer's bow to go right into you, that, like a
   stag that is smitten by the archer, you might retire into the glades of
   the forest, to weep alone and die alone, unless the hand that sent in
   the dart shall gently draw it out and heal the wound that it has made!
   Oh! for this personal conviction!--conviction of sin, of righteousness,
   and of judgment laid home to each man's heart. It must be so, or you
   cannot be saved. But now another truth is suggested by the text. It is
   this, that:--

   III. WHEN GOD'S STILL SMALL VOICE SPEAKS TO MEN PERSONALLY, THE SUBJECT
   IS THEMSELVES AND THEIR ACTIONS.

   "What doest thou here, Elijah?" This was the voice of God. May the same
   voice come to-night to some here about their actions. Let me take the
   text and use it to you. What are you doing? What doest thou? What have
   you been doing? You are getting on in life. What have you done?
   Mischief I fear. What good have you done? You were made to glorify God,
   that was the end for which you were created. Have you glorified him?
   You have been fed by him, clothed by him. Have you made him any return?
   What have you done? No good--much evil. What are you doing now? Sitting
   here and listening. Ay, but how are you treating the Word? Are you
   receiving it? Do you hear the voice of mercy, and do you reject it, or
   will you accept it? What are you going to do? What are you going to do
   to-night when you get out of this place? How will the last hours of the
   precious Sabbath be spent? And to-morrow, and the next day--what are
   you planning? Is there anything holy in it, anything noble in it,
   anything that will be glorifying to God? Do you never take stock?
   Spiritual trader, do you never take stock? Mariner upon the sea of
   life, cost thou never consult thy chart? Dost thou never heave the
   lead, or take thy bearings? Art thou so mad as to sail on in the fog,
   and not care what becomes of so goodly a vessel as thy soul? Oh! pause.
   What hast thou done? What art thou doing? What wilt thou do? Especially
   what wilt thou do in the swellings of Jordan? Unsaved, what will you do
   when the death-sweat stands upon your brow--when the cold beaded drops
   are there, and the marrow is frozen, and the strong man gathers up his
   feet in the bed for the last dread struggle--what will you do without a
   Saviour? What will you do when the trumpet rings through heaven and
   earth, and sea, and men live again, and you, with them, stand before
   the judgment-seat, and amidst the rolling thunder the book is opened
   and your sins stand there unforgiven? What will you do? What will you
   do? Oh! that you may never be brought to this, but be brought to Christ
   to-night! Do you notice how the word was put? It was not, "What are you
   doing?" only, but "What doest thou--thou, Elijah?" And there are some
   special persons whose sins receive an aggravation by the very fact that
   they are what they are. I know thee--what thou west of old. What a
   sweet child. How his mother loved him, and loved to hear him sing, and
   pray, too, in his way. What happiness it was to the parents! Ah! they
   fell asleep and died, and 'tis a mercy they did, else perhaps your
   course would have brought them to the grave with grief. What doest
   thou, child of many prayers and many tears? What doest thou? Still to
   be an enemy to thy mother's God, and to blaspheme the name they father
   loved. You have been hearers of the gospel, some of you almost ever
   since you can recollect. Your mother carried you in her arms to God's
   house, and sometimes conscience has pricked you, and the word has gone
   through, and through, and through; but you have resisted it. What has
   led you, I pray you, to remain still what you are? What infernal power
   has helped you to steel your heart? In what fire has your soul been
   annealed to make it hard as adamant stone? O soul, soul, sinful soul,
   delaying, procrastinating soul! what doest thou in such a states after
   so much love and mercy? And I might speak to some that promised fair
   many times, and that have been almost persuaded to be Christians, and
   yet still are out of God, and out of Christ, and on the borders of
   destruction. What do you here? Perhaps there is someone who has come to
   London lately, that in the country was an observer of religion,
   apparently sincere, but oh! this wicked London! You have given up those
   good habits; you--have got into bad company, and oh! I shall not tell
   what you have done; but I hope you will confess it to God in your own
   secrecy. But how dare you do it? How could you do its Oh! how could you
   do it? How could you be a prodigal?--you, your fathers dearly beloved,
   taught so well, with so much light, with such a tender conscience--how
   could you sin? Why the very tramps of the street might be ashamed of
   you, for they never knew much better. Those that go into foulest sin
   might condemn you, for with their bad street training, educated perhaps
   in the kennel, who wonders that they are what they are? But for you, it
   is a wonder. The angel Lucifer, son of the morning, fell down to the
   deeps of hell. You have fallen from the side of the pulpit, fallen from
   a Christian parent's side, and almost from inside the Church of God,
   and fallen into sin. Perhaps I speak to some that have belied their
   baptism, have given up the profession that they made when they there
   were buried with Christ, who have belied the sacramental table where
   they once sat, and professed to eat his bread and drink of his cup, and
   to be partakers of his body and of his blood. You have crucified the
   Lord afresh, and put him to an open shame. "What doest thou here,
   Elijah?" My, and you used to preach too; you used to preach to others,
   and now what are you? You were once, as it were, a priest at the altar
   of God, and now you are a priest at the altars of Baal. God have mercy
   upon you, and may his still small voice now speak in your soul.

   There was one point in the question which was asked, which was this:
   "What doest thou here?" Each man, when he is called to search himself
   by the Spirit of God, must recollect his surroundings. I thank God, my
   brethren and my sisters, that you are hearers--not to commend you that
   you may be Pharisees, because you happen to go to a place of worship. I
   do, nevertheless, praise God that you are here. When the sick lay round
   the Pool of Bethesda, there was some hope of their being healed. You
   are favoured in being where Christ is preached; but what doest thou
   here? Did you come to find a jest? Did you come to hear one who was
   much talked of in your hearing? Did you come from curiosity? Did you
   come from a worse motive? Well, never mind, but what are you doing now?
   Are you willing to listen to God's voice? Will you now yield? He round
   you now, as with the bands of a man, would cast the bands of his love,
   who was given for you, and to his altar bind you fast. 'Tis but to
   yield; and surely it must be hard to resist when it is divine mercy
   that plies you, and eternal love that persuades you. "Come unto me,"
   says Jesus; "come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest." Will you not come? "Whosoever will, let him come
   and take the water of life freely. " Will you not come? Oh! that your
   answer to the question, "What doest thou here? " might be to-night, " I
   am doing this here; I am laying my sins on Jesus; I am confessing the
   past; I am asking grace for the future; I am looking to the wounds of
   him that was cleft as a rock is cleft that I may shelter in him; I am
   saying, 'God be merciful to me a sinner."' Thy God be praised if such
   is the case. But I must close with the last observation, and that is,
   that:--

   IV. WHERE THE LORD DOES SPEAK WITH A STILL SMALL VOICE TO MEN
   PERSONALLY ABOUT THEIR CONDUCT AND THEIR SIN, IT IS ALWAYS EFFECTUAL.

   You notice what Elijah did. He first wrapped his mantle about his
   face--he became subdued and awe-stricken--full of reverence. Oh! it is
   a great thing when a sinner is willing to wrap his face when he is
   confounded, and say, "I cannot defend my course; I am guilty." We know
   that if at our judgment-seat a man pleads guilty, he is punished; but
   at the judgment-seat of the gospel whoever pleads guilty is forgiven.
   Wrap your face. Oh! but you thought that you were better than most; you
   went to church, and you went to the meeting-house, the chapel,
   regularly, and were you not better than others? Ah! wrap your face.
   Your church-goings and your chapel-goings have only increased your
   responsibilities if you have rejected the Saviour. Take the mantle of
   self humiliation, and wrap it about your face now. Say, with the leper,
   "Unclean! Unclean!" Where you are in the Tabernacle, where you are,
   never mind where you stand or sit, I commend to you the publican's
   prayer. Say it now, and God help you, "God be merciful to me a sinner."
   Did you say it from your heart? Go home. You shall go home to your
   house justified, for he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.

   But you must notice that while Elijah thus wrapped his face in
   reverence, he stood still and listened. It was a still small voice, and
   the prophet was attending. No other sound was heard but this, "What
   doest thou here, Elijah?" But he stood. I doubt not that man of iron
   stood and wept, and seemed to say in his soul, "Speak, Lord, for thy
   servant heareth." "He that bath earn to hear, let him hear." Oh! be
   very attentive to the voice of God s Spirit! If you have only a half of
   a good thought, take care of it. It may be the beginning of another
   one. Oh! if you have only just got a little leaning, thank God for it.
   Remember Christ does not quench the smoking flax; don't quench it
   yourself. "Quench not the Spirit." Oh! I have known times when I would
   have given my whole life to have had one tear of repentance. Can you
   repent now? Can you long after God now? Oh! cherish that longing! Yield
   to the Spirit of God. Don't be like iron to the fire that needs to have
   the blast-furnace on it before it will melt; but oh! be like wax to the
   flame, like cork on the water that moves up and down with every
   influence. God make you so. It wants a strong wind to shake the oak;
   but the fern that grows under it waves its branches at every breath of
   the zephyr. May you be just as sensitive as that. Bow before the
   Spirit's influence. The Lord make you to do it for his name's sake.

   And then, best of all and last of all, the prophet was not only
   reverent, humble, and attentive, but he was obedient. God told him to
   go and do this and that. He never questioned, but away he went and
   executed the divine commission, and until the time when he was taken up
   in the chariot of fire Elijah never quailed again. The still small
   voice had made him twice a man, and steeled him once again to bear all
   that he had to endure in his chequered life. He was obedient to the
   heavenly vision. Will you be obedient to-night?" If ye be willing and
   obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land." May God make you to be
   obedient. But you say, "What is his command then? What is the work of
   God-this great work that God commands? This is the one gospel precept,
   "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved"; or take it
   in the shape in which the Master put it, "He that believeth and is
   baptized, shall be saved." To believe is to trust. To be baptized is to
   be immersed into Christ--immersed in water upon profession of faith,
   for so it is put, and I dare not give you half the gospel. So it is
   put, "He that with his heart believeth, and with his mouth maketh
   confession of him, shall be saved." Don't leave out any part of the
   divine command. Be obedient to the whole of it. "Believe and be
   baptized," or as the Apostle put it, " Repent, and be baptized, every
   one of you." May God grant that you may be obedient to this. The great
   command is, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. "Trust in him--in his
   substitutionary work for sinners. He bore their guilt, and was punished
   in their stead, and whosoever trusts in what he did--in a word, trusts
   in him, is saved. God grant you to do it. I leave it to his still small
   voice to work this blessed result. Amen.

   A Sermon

   (No. 3499)

   Published on Thursday, February 17th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [7]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, August 13th, 1871.

   "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the
   sun light on them, nor any heat."--Revelation 7:16.

   WE cannot too often turn our thoughts heavenward, for this is one of
   the great cures for worldliness. The way to liberate our souls from the
   bonds that tie us to earth is to strengthen the cords that kind us to
   heaven. You will think less of this poor little globe when you think
   more of the world to come. This contemplation will also serve to
   console us for the loss, as we call it, of those who have gone before.
   It is their gain, and we will rejoice in it. We cannot have a richer
   source of consolation than this, that they who have fallen asleep in
   Christ have not perished; they have not lost life, but they have gained
   the fullness of it. They are rid at all that molests us here, and they
   enjoy more than we as yet can imagine. Cheer your hearts, ye mourners,
   by looking up to the gate of pearl, by looking up--to those who day
   without night surround the throne of their Redeemer. It will also tend
   to quicken our diligence if we think much of heaven. Suppose I should
   miss it after all! What if I should not so run that I may obtain! If
   heaven be little, I shall be but a little loser by losing it; but if it
   be indeed such that the half could never be told us, then, may God
   grant us diligence to make our calling and election sure, that we may
   be certain of entering into this rest, and may not be like the many who
   came out of Egypt, but who perished in the wilderness and never entered
   into the promised land. All things considered, I know of no meditation
   that is likely to be more profitable than a frequent consideration of
   the rest which remaineth for the people of God. I ask, then, for a very
   short time that your thoughts may go upward to the golden streets.

   And, first, we shall think a little of the blessedness of the saints as
   described in the simple words of our text; then we will say a few words
   as to how they came by that felicity; and thirdly, draw some practical
   lessons from it. First, then, we have here:--

   I. A DESCRIPTION OF THE BLESSEDNESS OF THE GLORIFIED.

   We have not the full description of it here; but we have here a
   description of certain evils from which they are free. You notice they
   are of two or three kinds--first, such as originate within--"They shall
   hunger no more, neither thirst any more"--they are free from inward
   evils; secondly, such as originate without--"Neither shall the sun
   light on them, nor any heat." They are altogether delivered from the
   results of outward circumstances. Take the first: "They shall hunger no
   more, neither thirst any more." We are never so to strain Scripture for
   a spiritual sense as to take away its natural sense, and hence we will
   begin by saying this is no doubt to be understood physically of the
   body they will have in glory. Whether there will be a necessity for
   eating and drinking in heaven, we will not say, for we are not told,
   but anyhow it is met by the text, "The Lamb that is in the midst of the
   throne shall feed them"--if they need food--"and lead them to living
   fountains of water" if they need to drink. Whatever may be the
   necessities of the future, those necessities shall never cause a pang.
   Here, the man who is hungry may have to ask the question, "What shall I
   eat?"; the man who is thirsty may have to say, "What shall I drink?";
   and we have all to ask, "Wherewithal shall we be clothed?" But such
   questions shall never arise there. They are abundantly supplied.
   Children of God have been hungry here: the great Son of God, the head
   of the household was hungry before them; and they need not wonder if
   they have fellowship with him in this suffering. Children of God have
   had to thirst here: their great Lord and Master said, "I thirst"; they
   need not wonder, therefore, if in his affliction they have to take some
   share. Should not they who are to be like their head in heaven be
   conformed unto him on earth? But up yonder there is no poverty, and
   there shall be no accident that shall place them in circumstances of
   distress. "They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more."

   While we take this physically, there is no doubt that it is to be
   understood mentally. Our minds are also constantly the victims of
   hungerings and thirstings. There are on earth various kinds of this
   hunger and thirst--in a measure evil, in a measure also innocent. There
   are many men that in this world are hungering after wealth, and the
   mouth of avarice can never be filled. It is as insatiable as the
   horse-leech, and for ever cries, "Give, give!" But such hunger was
   never known in heaven, and never can be, for they are satisfied there;
   they have all things and abound. All their enlarged capacities can
   desire they already possess, in being near the throne of God and
   beholding his glory; there is no wealth which is denied them. Here,
   too, some of the sons of men hunger after fame, and oh! what have not
   men done to satisfy this? It is said that breaks through stone walls;
   certainly ambition has done it. Death at the cannon's mouth has been a
   trifle, if a man might win the bubble reputation. But in heaven there
   is no such hunger as that Those who once had it, and are saved, scorn
   ambition henceforth. And what room would there be for ambition in the
   skies? They take their crowns and cast them at their Saviour's feet.
   They have their palm-branches, for they have won the victory, but they
   ascribe the conquest to the Lamb, their triumph to his death. Their
   souls are satisfied with his fame. The renown of Christ has filled
   their spirit with everlasting contentment. They hunger no more, nor
   thirst any more, in that respect. And oh! what hunger and thirst there
   has been on earth by those of tender and large heart for a fit object
   of love! I mean not now the common thing called "love," but the
   friendship which is in man's heart, and sends out its tendrils wanting
   something to which to cling. We must--we are born and created for that
   very purpose--we must live together, we cannot develop ourselves alone.
   And oftentimes a lonely spirit has yearned for a brother's ear, into
   which to pour its sorrows; and doubtless many a man has been brought to
   destruction and been confined to the lunatic asylum whose reason might
   have been saved had there been some sympathetic spirit, some kind,
   gentle heart that would have helped to bear his burden. Oh! the hunger
   and the thirst of many a soul after a worthy object of confidence. But
   they hunger and they thirst, up there, no more. Their love is all
   centred on their Saviour. Their confidence, which they reposed in him
   on earth, is still in him. He is their bosom's Lord, their heart's
   Emperor, and they are satisfied, and, wrapped up in him, they hunger
   and they thirst no more.

   And how many young spirits there are on earth that are hungering after
   knowledge who would fain get the hammer and break the rock, and find
   out the history of the globe in the past. They would follow philosophy,
   if they could, to its source, and find out the root of the matter. Oh!
   to know, to know, to know! The human mind pants and thirsts for this.
   But there they know even as they are known. I do not know that in
   heaven they know all things--that must be for the Omniscient only--but
   they know all they need or really want to know; they are satisfied
   there. There will be no longer searching with a spirit that is ill at
   ease. They may, perhaps, make progress even there, and the scholar may
   become daily more and more wise; but there shall never be such a
   hungering and thirsting as to cause their mental faculties the
   slightest pang. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more. Oh!
   blessed land where the seething ocean of man's mind is hushed, and
   sleeps in everlasting calm! Oh! blessed country where the hungry
   spirit, that crieth every hour for bread, and yet for more, and yet for
   more, and spends its labour for that which satisfieth not, shall be fed
   with the bread of angels, and be satisfied with favour and full of the
   goodness of the Lord.

   But, dear friends, surely the text also means our spiritual hungering
   and thirsting. "Blessed is the man that hungers and thirst to-day after
   righteousness, for he shall be filled." This a kind of hunger that we
   ought to desire to have; this is a sort of thirst that the more you
   have of it will be the indication of the possession of more grace. On
   earth it is good for saints to hunger and to thirst spiritually, but up
   there they have done even with that blessed hunger and that blessed
   thirst. Today, beloved, some of us are hungering after holiness. Oh!
   what would I not give to be holy, to be rid of sin, of every evil thing
   about me! My eyes--ah! adieu sweet light, if I might also say, "Adieu
   sin! "My mouth--ah! well would I be content to be dumb if I might
   preach by a perfect life on earth! There is no faculty I know of that
   might not be cheerfully surrendered if the surrender of it would
   deprive us of sin. But they never thirst for holiness in heaven, for
   this excellent reason, that they are without fault before the throne of
   God. Does it not make your mouth water? Why this is the luxury of
   heaven to be perfect. Is not this--the heaven of heaven, to be clean
   rid of the root and branch of sin, and not a rag or bone, or piece of a
   bone of our old depravity left--all gone like our Lord, made perfect
   without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing. And here, too, brethren and
   sisters, we very rightly hunger and thirst after full assurance and
   confidence. Many are hungering after it; they hope they are saved, and
   they thirst to be assured that they are. But there is no such thirst as
   that in heaven, for, having crossed the golden threshold of Paradise,
   no saint ever asks himself, "Am I saved?" They see his face without a
   cloud between; they bathe in the sea of his love; they cannot question
   that which they perpetually enjoy. So, too, on earth I hope we know
   what it is to hunger and thirst for fellowship with Christ. Oh! when he
   is gone from us--if he do but hide his face from us, how we cry, "My
   soul desires thee in the night"! We cannot be satisfied unless we have
   the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. But in
   heaven they have no such thing. There the shepherd is always with the
   Sheep, the King is ever near them, and because of his perpetual
   presence their hungering and their thirsting will be banished for ever.
   Thus much upon those evils, then, that would arise from within. As they
   are perfect, whatever comes from within is a source of pleasure to
   them, and never of pain.

   And now, dear friends, the evils that come from without: let us think
   of them. We no doubt can appreciate in some measure, though not to the
   degree which we should if we were in Palestine in the middle of
   summer--we can appreciate the words, "Neither shall the sun light on
   them, nor any heat." This signifies that nothing external shall injure
   the blessed. Take it literally. There shall be nothing in the
   surroundings of heavenly saints that shall cause glorified spirits any
   inconvenience. I think we may take it mainly in relation to the entire
   man glorified; and so let us say that on earth the sun lights on us and
   many heats in the form of affliction. What heats of affliction some
   here have passed through! Why there are some here who are seldom free
   from physical pain. There are many of the best of God's children that,
   if they get an hour without pain, are joyful indeed. There are others
   that have had a great fight of affliction Through poverty they have
   fought hard. They have been industrious, but somehow or other God has
   marked them out for the scant tables and the thread-worn garments. They
   are the children of poverty, and the furnace heat is very hot about
   them. With others it has been repeated deaths of those they have loved.
   Ah! how sad is the widow's case! How deep the grief of the fatherless!
   How great the sorrow of bereaved parents! Sometimes the arrows of God
   fly one after the other; first one falls and then another until we
   think we shall hardly have one left. These are the heats of the furnace
   of affliction. And at other times these take the form of ingratitude
   from children. I think we never ought to repine so much about the death
   of a child as about the ungodly life of a child. A dead cross is very
   heavy, but a living cross is heavier far. Many a mother has had a son
   of whom she might regret that he did not die even the very hour of his
   birth, for he has lived to be the grief of his parents, and a dishonour
   to their name. These are sharp trials--these heats--but you shall have
   done with them soon. "Neither shall the sun light on them, nor any
   heat." No poverty, no sickness, no bereavement, no ingratitude--nothing
   of the kind. They for ever rest from affliction. Heat sometimes comes
   in another form--in the matter of temptation. Oh! how some of God's
   people have been tried--tried by their flesh! Their constitution,
   perhaps, has been hot, impulsive, and they have been carried off their
   feet, or would have been but for the interposing grace of God, many and
   many a time. They have been tempted, too, in their position, and they
   of their own household have been their enemies. They have been tempted
   by their peculiar circumstances; their feet have almost gone many a
   time. And they have been tempted by the devil; and hard work it is to
   stand against Satanic insinuations. It is hot, indeed, when his fiery
   darts fly. Oh! when we shall have once crossed the river, how some of
   us who have been much tempted will look back upon that old dog of hell,
   and laugh him to scorn because he will not be able even to bark at us
   again! Then we shall be for ever free from him. He worries us now
   because he would devour us, but there, as he cannot devour, so shall he
   not even worry us. " Neither shall the sun " of temptation " light on
   them, nor any heat." Happy are the people that are in such a case. The
   heats of persecution have often, too, carried about the saints. It is
   the lot of God's people to be tried in this way. Through much
   tribulation of this sort they inherit the kingdom; but there are no
   Smithfields in heaven, and no Bonners to light up the faggots, no
   Inquisitions in heaven, no slanderers there to spoil the good man's
   name. They shall never have the heat of persecution to suffer again.
   And, once more, they shall not have the heat of care. I do not know
   that we need have it, even here; but there are a great many of God's
   people who allow care to get very hot about them. Even while sitting in
   this place to-night while the hymn was going up, "What must it be to be
   there! " the thoughts of some of you have been going away to your
   business, or your home. While we are trying to preach and draw your
   attention upwards, perhaps some housewife is thinking of something she
   has left out which ought to have been looked up before she came away,
   or wondering where she left the key. We make any excuses for care
   through the cares we continually invent, forgetting the words, "Cast
   all your care on him. for he careth for you." But they have no cares in
   heaven. "They hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall
   the sun light on them, nor any heat." Ah! good man, there shall be no
   ships at sea by-and-bye-no harvests--to trouble you as to whether the
   good weather will last! Ah! good woman, you shall have no more children
   that are sickly to fret over, for there you will have all you desire,
   and be in a family circle that is unbroken, for all the brothers and
   sisters of God's family shall by-and-bye be there, and so you shall be
   eternally blest.

   We have thus opened up as well as we could the words of the text on the
   felicity of the saints. Now, very briefly:--

   II. HOW DO THEY COME TO BE HAPPY?

   Well, it is quite clear that they did not come to it because they were
   very fortunate people on earth, for if you read another passage of the
   Word of God you will find, "These are they that came out of great
   tribulation." Those that have had trial and suffering on earth are
   amongst those that have the bliss of heaven. Encourage yourselves, you
   poor and suffering ones. It is quite certain they did not come there
   from their own merit, for we read, they have "washed their robes"--they
   wanted washing. They did not keep them always undefiled. There had been
   spots upon them. They came there not because they deserved to be there,
   but because of the rich grace of God. How did they come there then?
   Well, first, they came there through the lamb that was slain. He bore
   the sun and the heat, and, therefore, the sun doth not light on them,
   nor any heat. The hot sun of Jehovah's justice shone full upon the
   Saviour--scorched, and burned, and consumed him with grief and anguish;
   and because the Saviour suffered, therefore we suffer it no more. All
   our hopes of heaven are found at the cross.

   But they came there next because the Saviour shed his blood. They
   washed their robes in it. Faith linked them to the Saviour. The
   fountain would not have cleansed their robes if they had not washed in
   it. Oh! there shall be none come to heaven but such as have by faith
   embraced what God provides. Dear hearer, judge thyself whether thou art
   right, therefore. Hast thou washed thy robe and made it white in the
   Lamb's blood? Is Christ all in all to thee? If not, canst thou hope to
   be there? And they are there in perfect bliss, we are told. No sun
   lights on them, nor any heat, because the Lamb in the midst of the
   throne is with them. How could they be unhappy who see Christ? Is not
   this the secret of their bliss, that Jesus fully reveals himself to
   them?

   And besides, they have the love of God to enjoy, for the last word of
   the chapter is, "God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes." The
   blood of Jesus applied, the presence of Jesus enjoyed, and the love of
   God fully revealed--these are the causes of the bliss of the saved in
   heaven. But we must close our meditation with the last point, which
   is:--

   III. WHAT THIS TEACHES US.

   First, the bliss of the saved in glory teaches us to long for it. It is
   legitimate to long for heaven--not to long to escape from doing our
   duty here. It is idleness to be always wanting to have done with this
   world--it is clear sloth--but to be longing to be where Jesus is, is
   only natural and gracious. Should not the child long to go home from
   the school? Should not the captive pine for liberty? Should not the
   traveller in foreign lands long to see his native country? Should not
   the bride, the married wife, when she has been long away from her
   husband, long to see his face? If you did not long for heaven, surely
   you might question whether heaven belonged to you. If you have ever
   tasted of the joys of the saints, as believers do on earth, you will
   sing with full soul:--

   "My thirsty spirit faints

   To reach the land I love

   The bright inheritance of saints,

   Jerusalem above."

   You may long for this.

   And the next lesson is, be patient until you get there. As it will be
   such a blessed place when you arrive, don't trouble about the
   difficulties of the way. You know our hymn:--

   "The way may be rough, but it cannot be long."

   So

   "Let us fill it with hope, and cheer it with song."

   You know how well your horse goes when you turn its head homewards.
   Perhaps you had to flog him a bit before, but when he begins to know he
   is going down the long lane which leads home he will soon lift up his
   ears, and away, away he will go. We ought to have as much sense as
   horses. Our heads are turned towards heaven We are steering towards
   that port--homeward bound. It may be rough weather but we shall soon be
   in the fair haven where not a wave of trouble shall ever disturb us
   again. Be patient, be patient. The husbandman has waited for the
   precious fruits of the earth; you can well wait for the precious things
   of heaven. You sow in tears, but you shall reap in joy. He has promised
   you a harvest. He who cannot lie has said the seed-time and harvest
   shall never cease They do not cease below; depend upon it, they won't
   cease above. There is a harvest for you who have been sowing here
   below.

   Our first lesson, then, is, long for this, and then be patient in
   waiting. But our next lesson is to be, wait your appointed time. And
   now the next instruction is, make much of faith. They entered heaven
   because they had washed their robes in blood. Make much of the blood
   and much of the faith by which you have washed. Dear hearers, have you
   all got faith? It is, as it were, the key of blessedness. "But all men
   have not faith," says the Apostle. Hast thou faith? Dost thou believe
   in Christ Jesus? In other words, dost thou trust thyself alone with
   him' Can you sing with our poet:--

   "Nothing in my hand I bring

   Simply to thy cross I cling;

   Naked, come to thee for dress,

   Helpless, look to thee for grace.

   Foul, I to the fountain fly,

   Wash me, Saviour, or I die"?

   Make much of the faith that will admit you to heaven.

   Once more, our text teaches us this lesson--Do any of us want to know
   what heaven is on earth? Most of us will say, "Aye" to that. Well then,
   the text tells you how to find heaven on earth. You find it in the same
   way as they find it in heaven. First, be thou washed in the blood of
   Christ, and that will be a great help towards happiness on earth. It
   will give thee peace now, "the peace of God that passeth all
   understanding." Some people think that heaven on earth is to be found
   in the theatre, and in the ballroom, and in the giddy haunts of
   fashion. Well, it may be heaven to some, but if God has any love to
   you, it won't be heaven to you. Wash your robe, therefore, in the
   Saviour's blood, and there will be the beginning of heaven on earth.

   Then next, it appears, if you read the connection of our text, that
   those who enjoy heaven serve God day and night in his temple. If you
   want heaven on earth, serve God continually day and night. Having
   washed your robe first, then put it on, and go out to serve God. Idle
   Christians are often unhappy Christians I have met with many a
   spiritual dyspeptic always full of doubts and fears. Is there a young
   man here full of doubts and fears who has lost the light he once
   possessed, and the joy he once had? Dear brother, get to work. In cold
   weather the best way to be warm is not to get before a fire, but to
   work. Exercise gives a healthy glow, even amidst the frost. "I am doing
   something," says one. Yes, with one hand; use the other hand. "Perhaps
   I should have too many irons in the fire," says one. You cannot have
   too many. Put them all in, and blow the fire with all the bellows you
   can get. I do not believe any Christian man works too hard, and, as a
   rule, if those who kill themselves in Christ's service were buried in a
   cemetery by themselves, it would be a long while before it would get
   filled. Work hard for Christ. It makes happy those who are in heaven to
   serve God day and night, and it will make you happy on earth. Do all
   you can. Another way is to have fellowship with Christ here. Read again
   this chapter. "He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them--he
   shall feed them." Oh! if you want to be happy, live near to Jesus. Poor
   men are not poor when Christ lives in their house. Truly, sick men have
   their beds made easy when Christ is there. Has he not said, " I will
   make his bed in all his sickness"? Only get fellowship with Jesus, and
   outward circumstances won't distress you. The sun will not light on
   you, nor any heat. You will be like the shepherd on Salisbury Plain,
   who said it was good weather, though it rained hard. "It is weather,"
   said he, "that pleases me." "How so?" said a traveller to him. "Well,
   sir," he said, "it pleases God, and what pleases God pleases me." "Good
   day!" said one to a Christian man. "I never had a bad day since I was
   converted," said he. "They are all good now since Christ is my
   Saviour." Do you not see, then, that if your wishes are subdued, if you
   do not hunger any more, or thirst any more as you used to do, and if
   you always live near to Christ, you will begin to enjoy heaven on
   earth. Begin, then, the heavenly life here below. The Bible says, "For
   he hath raised us up, and made us sit together in heavenly places in
   Christ Jesus." The way to live on earth, according to many, is to live
   on earth, but to look upward to heaven. That is a good way of living,
   but I will tell you a better, and that is to live in heaven, and look
   down on earth. The Apostle had learned that when he said, "Our
   conversation is in heaven." It is good to be on earth, and look up to
   heaven; it is better for the mind to be in heaven, and to look down
   upon earth. May we learn that secret. The Lord lead us into it. Then
   when faith is strong, and love is ardent, and hope is bright, we shall
   sing, with Watts:--

   "The men of grace have found

   Glory begun below;

   Celestial fruits on earthly ground

   From faith and hope may grow."

   The Lord grant you a participation in this bliss, beloved, and an
   abundant entrance into that bliss for ever, for Jesus Christ's sake.
   Amen.

                       Two Coverings and Two Consequences

   A Sermon

   (No. 3500)

   Published on Thursday, February 24th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [8]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "He that covereth his sins shall not prosper."--Proverbs 38:13.

   "Thou Hast covered all their sins."--Psalm 85:2.

   IN THESE two texts we have man's covering, which is worthless and
   culpable, and God's covering, which is profitable, and worthy of all
   acceptation. No sooner had man disobeyed his Maker's will in the garden
   of Eden than he discovered, to his surprise and dismay, that he was
   naked, and he set about at once to make himself a covering. It was a
   poor attempt which our first parents made, and it proved a miserable
   failure. "They sewed fig-leaves together." After that God came in,
   revealed to them yet more fully their nakedness, made them confess
   their sin, brought their transgression home to them, and then it is
   written, the Lord God made them coats of skin. Probably the coats were
   made of the skins of animals which had been offered in sacrifice, and,
   if so, they were a fit type of him who has provided us with a
   sin-offering and a robe of perfect righteousness. Every man since the
   days of Adam has gone through much of the same experience, more or less
   relying on his own ingenuity to hide his own confusion of face. He has
   discovered that sin has made him naked, and he has set to work to
   clothe himself. As I shall have to show you presently, he has never
   succeeded. But God has been pleased to deal with his own people,
   according to the riches of his grace; he has covered their shame and
   put away their sins that they should not be remembered any more.

   Let me now direct your attention, first, to man's covering, and its
   failure; and then to God's covering, and its perfection.

   May the Holy Spirit be pleased to give you discernment, that you may
   see your destitute state in the presence of God, and understand the
   merciful relief that God himself has provided in the bounty of his
   grace!

   I. MAN'S COVERING.

   There are many ways in which men try to cover their sin. Some do so by
   denying that they have sinned, or, admitting the fact, they deny the
   guilt; or else, candidly acknowledging both the sin and the guilt, they
   excuse and exonerate themselves on the plea of certain circumstances
   which rendered it, according to their showing, almost inevitable that
   they should act as they have done. By pretext and presence, apology and
   self-vindication, they acquit themselves of all criminality, and put a
   fine gloss upon every foul delinquency. Excuse-making is the commonest
   trade under heaven. The slenderest materials are put to the greatest
   account. A man who has no valid argument in arrest of judgment, no
   feasible reason why he should not be condemned, will go about and bring
   a thousand excuses, and ten thousand circumstances of extenuation, the
   whole of them weak and attenuated as a spider's web. Someone here may
   be saying within himself, "It may be I have broken the law of God, but
   it was too severe. To keep so perfect a law was impossible. I have
   violated it, but then I am a man, endowed with passions that involve
   propensities, and inflamed with desires that need gratification. How
   could I do otherwise than I have done? Placed in peculiar
   circumstances, I am borne along with the current. Subject to special
   temptations, I yield to the fascination; this is natural." So you
   think; so you essay to exculpate yourself. But, in truth, you are now
   committing a fresh sin; for you are abasing God, you are inculpating
   the Almighty. You are impugning the law to vindicate yourself for
   breaking it. There is no small degree of criminality about such an
   unrighteous defence. The law is holy, just, and good. You are throwing
   the onus of your sins upon God. You are trying to mane out that, after
   all, you are not to blame, but the fault lies with him who gave the
   commandment. Do you think that this will be tolerated? Shall the
   prisoner at the bar bring accusations against the Judge who tries him?
   Or shall he challenge the equity of the statute while he is arraigned
   for violating it? And as for the circumstances that you plead, what
   valid excuse can they furnish, Has it come to this--that it was not
   you, but your necessities, that did the wrong and are answerable for
   the consequence? Not you, indeed! you are a harmless innocent victim of
   circumstances! I suppose, instead of being censured, you ought almost
   to be pitied. What is this, again, but throwing the blame upon the
   arrangements of Providence, and saying to God, "It is the harshness of
   thy discipline, not the perverseness of my actions, that involves me in
   sin." What, I say, is this but a high impertinence, ay, veritable
   treason, against the Majesty of that thrice holy God, before whom even
   perfect angels veil their faces, while they cry, "Holy, holy, holy,
   Lord God of Hosts"? I pray thee resort not to such a covering as this,
   because, while it is utterly useless, it adds sin to sin, and exposes
   thee to fresh shame.

   In many cases persons violating the law of God have hoped to cover
   their transgression by secrecy. They have done the deed in darkness.
   They hope that no ear of man heard their footfall, or listened to their
   speech. Possibly they themselves held their tongue, and flattered
   themselves that no observer witnessed their movements or could divulge
   their action. So was it with Achan. I dare say he took the wedge of
   gold and the Babylonish garment, mid the confusion of the battle, and
   hid it when his comrades seemed too much engaged to notice so trivial
   fan affair. While they were rushing over the fallen walls of Jericho,
   amidst the debris and the dust, he might be unmolested; and then, in
   the dead of night, while they slept, he turned the sod of his tent, dug
   into the earth, and buried there his coveted treasure. All looks right,
   to his heart's content. He has smoothed it down, and spread his carpet
   over the grave of his lust. Little did he reckon of the Omniscient eye.
   Little did he count on the unerring lot that would come home to the
   tribe of Judah, to the family of the Zarhites, to the house of Zabdir,
   and, at last, to the son of Carmi, so that Achan himself would have to
   stand out confessed as a traitor--a robber of his God. Men little know
   the ways in which the Almighty can find them out, and bring the
   evidence that convicts, out of the devices that were intended to cover
   their sin.

   Do you not know that Providence is a wonderful detective? There are
   hounds upon the track of every thief, and murderer, and liar--in foot,
   upon every sinner of every kind. Each sin leaves a trail. The dogs of
   judgment will be sure to scent it out, and find their prey. There is no
   disentangling yourselves from the meshes of guilt; no possibility of
   evading the penalty of transgression. Very wonderful have been the ways
   in which persons who have committed crimes have been brought to
   judgment. A trifle becomes a tell-tale. The method of deceit gives a
   clue to the manner of discovery. Wretched the men who bury their
   secrets in their own bosom. Their conscience plays traitor to them.
   They have often been forged to betray themselves. We have read of men
   talking in their sleep to their fellows, and babbling out in their
   dreams the crime they had committed years before. God would have the
   secret disclosed. No eye had seen, neither could other tongue have
   bold, but the man turned king's evidence against himself; he has thus
   brought himself to judgment. It has often happened, in some form or
   other, that conscience has thus been witness against men. Do I address
   anyone who is just now practicing a secret sin? You would not have me
   point you out for all the world, nor shall I do so. Believe me,
   however, the sin is known. Dexterous though you have been in the
   attempt to conceal it, it has been seen. As surely as you live, it has
   been seen. "By whom?" say you. Ah! by One who never forgets what he
   sees, and will be sure to tell of it. He may commission a little bird
   of the air to whisper it. Certainly he will one day proclaim it by the
   sound of trumpet to listening worlds. You are watched, sir; you are
   known. You have been narrowly observed, young girl; those things you
   have hidden away will be brought to light, for God is the great
   discoverer of sin. His eye has marked you; his providence will track
   you. It is vain to think that ye can conceal your transgressions.
   Before high heaven, disguise is futile. Yea, the darkness hideth not;
   the night shineth as the day. I have known persons who have harboured a
   sin in their breast till it has preyed upon their constitution. They
   have been like the Spartan boy who had stolen a fox, and was ashamed to
   have it known, so he kept it within his garment, till it ate through
   his flesh, and he fell dead. He suffered the fox to gnaw his heart ere
   he would betray himself. There are those who have got a sin, if not a
   lie in their right hand, yea, a lie in their heart, and it is eating
   into their very life. They dare not confess it. If they would confess
   it to their God, and make restitution to those whom they have offended,
   they would soon come to peace; but they vainly hope that they can cover
   the sin, and hide it from the eyes of God and man. He that covereth his
   sin in this fashion shall not prosper.

   Again, full many a time sinners have tried to cover their sin with
   falsehood. Indeed, this is the usual habit--to lie--to cloak their
   guilt by denying it. Was not this the way with Gehazi? When the prophet
   said, "Whence comest thou, Gehazi?" he said, "Thy servant went no
   whither." Then the prophet told him that the leprosy of Naaman should
   cleave to him all the days of his life. The sin of Ananias and
   Sapphira, in lying in order to hide their sin, how quickly was it
   discovered, and how terrible was the retribution! I wonder that men and
   women can lie as they do after reading that story. "Hast thou sold the
   land for so much?" said Peter. And Ananias said, "Yea, for so much." At
   that instant he fell down and gave up the ghost. Three hours after,
   when his wife, Sapphire, said the same, the feet of the young men who
   had buried her husband were at the door, ready to carry out her corpse,
   and bury her by his side. Oh! sirs, ye must weave a tangled web,
   indeed, when once ye begin to deceive; and when you have woven it you
   will have to add lie to lie, and lie to lie, and yet all to no purpose,
   for you will be surely found out. There is something about a lie that
   always deludes the man who utters it. Liars have need of good memories.
   They are sure to leave a little corner uncovered through which the
   truth escapes. Their story does not hang together. Discrepancies excite
   suspicions, and evasions furnish a clue to discoveries, till the naked
   truth is unveiled. Then the deeper the plot the fouler is the shame.
   But to lie unto the God of truth, of what avail can that be? What
   advantageth it you to plead "not guilty," when he has witnessed your
   crime? That infallible Eye which never mistakes is never closed. He
   knows everything; from him no secret is hid. Why, therefore, dost thou
   imagine that thou canst deceive thy Maker?

   There are some who try to cover their sin by prevarication. With
   cunning subtlety they strive to evade personal responsibility.
   Memorable is the instance of David. I will not dwell upon his flagrant
   crime; but I must remind you of his sorry subterfuge, when he tried to
   hide the baseness of his lust by conspiring to cause the death of
   Uriah. There have been those who have schemed deep and long to throw
   the blame on others, even to the injury of their reputation, to escape
   the odium of their own malpractices. Who knows but in this congregation
   there may be someone who affects a high social position, supported by a
   deep mercantile immorality? Merchants there have been that have swollen
   before the public as men of wealth, while they were falsifying their
   acoounts, abstracting money, yet making the books tally, rolling in
   luxury, and living in jeopardy. Have they prospered? Were they to be
   envied? The detection that long haunted them at length overtook them;
   could they look it in the face? We have heard of their blank despair,
   their insane suicide; at any rate, a miserable exposure has been their
   melancholy climax. "Be sure your sin will find you out." You may run
   the length of your tether. It is short. The hounds of justice, swift of
   scent and strong of limb, are on your trail. Rest assured, you will be
   discovered. Could you escape the due reward in this life, yet certainly
   your guilt is known in heaven, and you shall be judged and condemned in
   that great day which shall decide your eternal destiny. Seek not, then,
   to cover up sin with such transparent cobwebs as these.

   Some people flatter themselves that their sin has already been hidden
   away by the lapse of time. "It was so very long ago," says one, "I had
   almost forgotten it; I was a lad at the time." "Aye," says another, "I
   am gray-headed now. It must have been twenty or thirty years ago.
   Surely you do not think that the sin of my far-off days will be brought
   out against me? The thing is gone by. Time must have obliterated it."
   Not so, my friend. It may be the lapse of time will only make the
   discovery the more clear. A boy once went into his father's orchard,
   and there in his rough play he broke a little tree which his father
   valued. But, rapidly putting it together again, he managed to conceal
   the fact, for the disunited parts of the tree took kindly to each
   other, and the tree stood as before. It so happened that more than
   forty years afterwards he went into that garden after a storm had blown
   across it in the night, and he found that the tree had been riven in
   two, and it had snapped precisely in the place where he had broken it
   when it was but a sapling. So there may come a crash to your character
   precisely in that place where you sinned when yet a lad. Ah! how often
   the transgressions of our youth remain within our bosoms! There lie the
   eggs of our young sin, and they hatch when men come into riper years.
   Don't be so sure that the lapse of time will consign your faults and
   follies to oblivion. You sowed your wild oats, sir; you have got to
   reap them. The time that has intervened has only operated to make that
   evil seed spring up, and you are so much the nearer to the harvest.
   Time does not change the hue of sin in the sight of God. If a man could
   live a thousand years, the sins of his first year would be as fresh in
   the memory of the Almighty as those of the last. Eternity itself will
   never wash out a sin. Flow on, ye ages; but the scarlet spots on the
   sand. Flow on still in mighty streams, but the damning spot is there
   still. Neither time nor eternity can cleanse it. Only one thing can
   remove sin. The lapse of time cannot. Let not any of you be so foolish
   as to hope it will.

   When the trumpet of the resurrection sounds, there will be a
   resurrection of characters, as well as of men. The man who has been
   foully slandered will rejoice in the light that reflects his purity.
   But the man whose latent vices have been skilfully veneered will be
   brought to the light too. His acts and motives will be alike exposed.
   As he himself looks and sees the resurrection of his crimes, with what
   horror will he face that day of judgment! "Ah! ah!" says he, "Where am
   I? I had forgotten these. These are the sins of my childhood, the sins
   of my youth, the sins of my manhood, and the sins of my old age. I
   thought they were dead and buried, but they start from their tombs. My
   memory has been quickened. How my brain reels as I think of them all!
   But there they are, and, like so many wolves around me, they seem all
   thirsting for my destruction." Beware, oh! men. Ye have buried your
   sins, but they will rise up from their graves and accuse you before
   God. Time cannot cover them.

   Or do any of you imagine that your tears can blot out transgressions?
   That is a gross mistake. Could your tears for ever flow; could you be
   transformed into a Niobe, and do nothing else but weep for aye, the
   whole flood could not wash out a single sin. Some have supposed that
   there may be efficacy in baptismal water, or in sacramental emblems, or
   in priestly incantations, or in confession to a priest--one who asks
   them to disclose their secret wickedness to him, and betrays a morbid
   avidity to make his breast the sewer into which all kinds of
   uncleanness should be emptied. Be not deceived. There is nothing in
   these ordinances of man, or these tricks of Romish priestcraft (I had
   almost said of witchcraft, the two are so much alike) to excuse the
   folly of those who are beguiled by them. You need not catch at straws
   when the rope is thrown out to you. There is pardon to be had;
   remission is to be found; forgivenness can be procured. Turn your back
   on yonder shavelings; lend not your ear to them, neither be ye the
   victims of their snares. In the street each day it makes one's soul sad
   to see them. Like the Pharisees of old, they wear their long garments
   to deceive. You cannot mistake them. Their silly conceit publishes
   their naked shame. Confide not in them for a moment. Christ can forgive
   you. God can blot out your sin. But they cannot ease your conscience by
   their penances, or remove your transgressions by their celebrations.

   Thus I have gone through a rough, not very accurate, list of the ways
   by which men hope to cover their sin, but they "shall not prosper."
   None of these shall succeed.

   A more joyous task devolves on me now, while I draw your attention to
   my second text, "Thou hast covered all their sin."

   II. GOD'S COVERING.

   This fact is affirmed concerning the people of God. All who have
   trusted in the atoning sacrifice which was presented by the Lord Jesus
   Christ upon Calvary may accept this welcome assurance, "God. has
   covered all their sin." How this hath come to pass I will tell you.
   Before ever God covers a man's sins he unveils them. Did you ever see
   your sins unveiled? Did it ever seem as if the Lord put his hand upon
   you, and said, "Look, look at them"? Have you been led to see your sins
   as you never saw them before? Have you felt their aggravations fit to
   drive you to despair? As you have looked at them, has the finger of
   detection seemed to point out your blackness? Have you discovered in
   them a depth of guilt, and iniquity, and hell--desert which never
   struck your mind before? I recollect a time when that was a spectacle
   always before the eyes of my conscience. My sin was ever before me. If
   God thus makes you see your sin in the light of his countenance, depend
   upon it he has his purposes of mercy toward you. When you see and
   confess it, he will blot it out. So soon as God, in infinite
   loving-kindness, makes the sinner know in truth that he is a sinner,
   and strips him of the rags of his self-righteousness, he grants him
   pardon and clothes his nakedness. While he stands shivering before the
   gaze of the Almighty, condemned, the guilt is purged from his
   conscience. I do not know of a more terrible position in one's
   experience than to stand with an angry God gazing upon you, and to know
   that wherever God's eye falls upon you it sees nothing but sin; sees
   nothing in you but what he must hate and must abhor. Yet this is the
   experience through which God puts those to whom he grants forgiveness.
   He makes them know that he sees how sinful they are, and he makes them
   feel how vile and leprous they are. His justice withers their pride;
   his judgment appals their heart. They are humbled in the very dust, and
   made to cry out--each man trembling for his own soul--"God be merciful
   to me, a sinner!"

   Not till this gracious work of conviction is fully wrought does the
   Lord appear with the glorious proclamation that whosoever believeth in
   the Lord Jesus shall have his sins covered. That proclamation. I have
   now openly to publish and personally to deliver to you. With your
   outward ears you may have heard it hundreds of times. It is old, yet
   ever new. Whosoever among you, knowing himself to be guilty, will come
   and put his trust in Jesus Christ, shall have his sins covered. "Can
   God do that?" Yes, he can. He alone can cover sin: Against him the sin
   was committed. It is the offended person who must pardon the offender.
   No one else can. He is the King. He has the right to pardon. He is the
   Sovereign Lord, and he can blot out sin. Beside that, he can cover it
   lawfully, for the Lord Jesus Christ (though ye know the story, let me
   tell it again--the song of redemption always rings out a charming
   melody), Jesus Christ, the Father's dear Son, in order that the justice
   of God might be vindicated, bare his breast to its dreadful hurt, and
   suffered in our room, and place, and stead, what we ought to have
   suffered as the penalty of our sin. Now the sacrifice of God covers
   sin--covers it right over; and he more than covers it, he makes it
   cease to be. Moreover, the Lord Jesus kept the law of God, and his
   obedience stands, instead of our obedience; and God accepts him and his
   righteousness on our behalf, imputing his merits to our souls.

   Oh! the virtue of that atoning blood! Oh! the blessedness of that
   perfect righteousness of the Son of God, by which he covers our sins!

   There are two features of covering I should like to recall to your
   recollection. The one was the mercy-seat or propitiatory, over the
   golden ark, wherein were the tables of stone. Those tables of stone
   seemed, as it were, to reflect the sins of Israel. As in a mirror they
   reflected the transgression of God's people. God was above, as it were,
   looking down between the cherubic wings. Was he to look down upon the
   law defied and defiled by Israel? Ah! no; there was put over the top of
   the ark, as a lid which covered it all, a golden lid called the
   mercy-seat, and when the Lord looked down he looked upon that lid which
   covered sin. Beloved, such is Jesus Christ, the covering for all our
   sins. God sees no sin in those who are hidden beneath Jesus Christ.

   There was another covering at the Red Sea. On that joyous day when the
   Egyptians went down into the midst of the sea pursuing the Israelites,
   at the motion of Moses' rod the waters that stood upright like a wall
   leapt back into their natural bed and swallowed up the Egyptians. Great
   was the victory when Miriam sang, "The depths have covered them. There
   is not one of them left." It is even so that Jesus Christ's atonement
   has covered up our sins. They are sunk in his sepulchre; they are
   buried in his tomb. His blood, like the Red Sea, has drowned them. "The
   depths have covered them. There is not one of them left." Against the
   believer there is not a sin in God's Book recorded. He that believeth
   in him is perfectly absolved. "Thou hast covered all their sin." I
   shall not have time to dwell upon the sweetness of this fact, but I
   invite you that believe to consider its preciousness; and I hope you
   who have not believed will feel your mouth watering after it; to know
   that every sin one has ever committed, known and unknown, is
   gone--covered by Christ. To be assured that when Jesus died he did not
   die for some of our sins, but for all the sins of his people; not for
   their sins up till now, but for all the sins they ever will commit!
   Well does Kent put it:--

   "Here's pardon for transgressions past,

   It matters not how black they're cast

   And O, my soul, with wonder view

   For sins to come here's pardon too."

   The atonement was made before the sin was committed. The righteousness
   was presented even before we had lived. "Thou hast covered all their
   sin. It seems to me as if the Lamb of God, slain from before the
   foundation of the world, had in the purpose of God, from the foundation
   of the world, covered all his people's sins. Therefore, we are accepted
   the Beloved, and dear to the Father's heart. Oh! what a joy it is to
   get a hold of something like this truth, especially when the truth gets
   a hold of you--when you can feel by the inwrought power and witness of
   the Holy Ghost that your sins are covered--that you dare stand up
   before a rein-trying, heart-searching God, and give thanks that every
   transgression you ever committed is hid from the view of those piercing
   eyes through Jesus Christ your Lord.

   Some people think we ought not to talk thus, that it is presumptuous.
   But really there is more presumption in doubting than there is in
   believing. For a child to believe his father's word is never
   presumption. I like to credit my Father's word. "He that believeth in
   him is not condemned." Condemned I am not, for I know I do believe in
   him. "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather,
   that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
   maketh intercession for us."

   Beloved, the covering is as broad as the sin. The covering completely
   covers, and for ever covers; for as God sees to-day no sin in those who
   are washed in Jesus' blood, so will he never see any. You are accepted
   with an acceptance that nothing can change. Whom once he loves he never
   leaves, but loves them to the end. The reason of his love to them does
   not lie in their merits nor their charms; the cause of love is in
   himself. The ground of his acceptance of them is in the person and work
   of Christ. Whatever they may be, whatever their condition of heart may
   be, they are accepted, because Christ lived and died. It is not a
   precarious or a conditional, but an eternal acceptance.

   Would you enjoy the blessedness of this complete covering? Cowering
   down beneath the tempest of Jehovah's wrath, which you feel in your
   conscience, would you obtain this full remission? Behold the gates of
   the City of Refuge which stand wide open. The grace of our Lord Jesus
   Christ is proclaimed! to the thirsty, needy, labouring, weary soul. Not
   merely open are the gates, but the invitation to enter is given. "Come
   unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you
   rest." You are bidden to lay hold upon eternal life. The way of doing
   so is simple. No works of yours, no merits, no tears, no preparations
   are required, but trust--trust--that is all. Believe in Jesus. Rely
   upon him; depend upon him; depend upon him. I have heard of Homer's
   Iliad being enclosed in a nutshell, so small was it written; but here
   is the Plain Man's Guide to Heaven in a nutshell. Here is the essence
   of the whole gospel in one short sentence. "Believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and thou shalt be saved." Trust him; trust him. That is the
   meaning of that word believe. Depend upon him, and as surely as thou
   doest it, nor death, nor hell, nor sin shall ever separate thee from
   the love of him whom thou hast embraced, from the protection of him in
   whose power thou hast taken shelter. The Lord lead you to cower beneath
   his covering wings, and grant you to be found in Christ, accepted in
   the Beloved. So shall your present peace be the foretaste of your
   eternal felicity. Amen.

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [9]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, August 6th, 1871.

   "For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the
   Lord's death till he come."--1 Cor. 11:26.

   I THINK we cannot too often explain the meaning of the two great
   Christian ordinances--baptism and the Supper of the Lord; for it is
   essential to our profiting by them that we understand them. If we do
   not know what they mean, they certainly cannot convey to us any
   blessing whatever. They are not mere channels of grace in themselves,
   apart from our understanding being exercised, and our hearts being
   moved by them. Very soon the best ordinance in the world will become a
   mere form, and will even degenerate into superstitious practice, unless
   it be understood; and we must not always take it for granted that the
   meaning of the simplest emblem is understood. Line upon line, precept
   upon precept, here a little, and there a little, must still be the
   motto of the Christian minister. We must explain, explain, and explain
   again, or else men will satisfy themselves with the outward form, and
   not reach to the teaching which the forms were intended to convey. Our
   text deals with the supper of our Lord, and we will read it again. "As
   often as eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death
   till he come."

   The first point of the text is what we do--we "show." Then, what do we
   show, and how? And then, who show it--"ye do show the Lord's death."
   And then, when?--"as often"--"till he come." First, then, when we come
   to the Lord's table:--

   I. WHAT WE DO.

   We "show." That word has two or three meanings. They all melt into one,
   but we shall get at it better by dividing it. It is meant here by
   showing Christ's death that we declare it. When the emblems are placed
   upon the table--bread and wine and we gather around it, we declare our
   firm belief that Jesus, the Son of God, descended into this world and
   died as a sacrifice for sin upon the arose. It has been found that if a
   great event is to be kept in mind in succeeding ages, there must be
   some memorial of it. Men by degrees forget it, and even come to be
   dubious as to whether such an event did occur. Sometimes a stone has
   been set up--a monument--but this has not always been most effective.
   God, when he would have the children of Israel remember that he brought
   them out of Egypt with a high hand and an outstretched arm, did not bid
   them set up a monument, but he ordained a ceremony which was to be
   practiced on a certain day. It was called "The Passover," and the
   slaughter of the lamb and the eating of it became a yearly declaration
   by the people of Israel that they believed that God brought their
   fathers up out of the house of bondage. So effective has this been that
   men have often used the same device. When the Jewish people escaped
   from the plot which was laid by Haman, through the wisdom of Mordecai
   and Esther, they ordained the keeping of the feast of Purim, that they
   might have in perpetual memory the goodness of God towards his people.

   And you know how, in our own English history and in the history of
   other countries, certain rites and ceremonies have been ordained in
   order that there might be a perpetual memorial, a declaration made that
   such and such a thing did occur. Now that more than eighteen hundred
   years ago Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, died upon Calvary by
   crucifixion, we do here protest and declare. We set forth again to a
   world that is skeptical and denies the fact which is its brightest
   hope--we set forth our confident belief that so it was; and as long as
   this ordinance shall be celebrated, there shall be a standing proof in
   the world that that was the case.

   But to set forth means more than to declare. It signifies, in the next
   place to represent. There is in the Lord's Supper a representation of
   the death of Christ. Men, when they have found an event to be
   interesting and remarkable, have often devised ways of representing it
   to the people that they might understand it.

   With regard to our Lord's death, there are some who hang up pictures on
   the wall; they think the use of the crucifix and so on to be proper. I
   find no teaching of that kind in the Word of God. I do find that too
   often such things lead to idolatry. And what shall we say of these
   miracle-plays which, even in these modern times, have been carried out,
   in which the death of our Lord Jesus Christ is travestied? They seem to
   be shocking to the Christian mind. But here, in a very simple manner,
   you have God's own appointed way of representing to ourselves and to
   onlookers the death of our Lord. This is the Christian's "show"--we
   show the death of Christ here by a divine appointment. I shall, farther
   on, show how it is so, and that the breaking of bread and the pouring
   forth of wine--the use of those two emblems--is a most telling, most
   suggestive, most instructive method of representing the death of
   Christ. There are two other ways of representing it--the one the pencil
   of the evangelist which has drawn the death of Christ in the Word of
   God; the other is the preaching of the gospel. It is the preacher's
   business to set forth Christ crucified--evidently crucified among you.
   The three ways that God has ordained of representing the death of
   Christ are the Word read, the Word preached, and this blessed ordinance
   of the Supper of the Lord.

   To "show." This means to declare, to testify; and it means also to
   represent. But it has a third meaning: it means also to hold forth, to
   make manifest, to publish, to call attention to. Now it has been a
   matter of fact that when the Jesuit missionaries went to China and
   converted a great many to what they called the Christian faith, they
   never mentioned the fact that Christ died. For years they concealed it,
   lest the people should be shocked Now we, on the other hand, put that
   first and foremost. We have no other Christianity than this, that
   Christ died and rose again, and we cannot come to the Lord's table
   without showing it. The Jesuit could, because it would puzzle the
   wisest man to see the death of Christ in the Mass. He might sit and
   look at a hundred Masses before he knew what it meant. But the moment
   we gather around this table and break bread, and pour out wine, whoever
   asks us, "What mean ye by this ordinance? the answer is prompt--the
   wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err in this--"We set forth to
   you that Jesus died." "God forbid that we should glory, save in the
   cross of our Lord Jesus Christ." We are not ashamed of a crucified
   Saviour. We have heard of some in these days who are always preaching a
   glorified Christ. We wish them such success as their ministry is likely
   to bring; but for us we preach a crucified Christ--"Christ and him
   crucified"; for it is here, after all, that the salvation of the sinner
   lies. Christ glorified is precious enough--oh! how unspeakably precious
   to a soul that is saved!--but first and foremost to a dying world it is
   Christ upon the cross that we have to declare. And, therefore, when we
   come to the Communion table we do three things. We assert the fact that
   Jesus died; we represent that fact in emblem, and then we thus press it
   upon the attention of men. We desire them to observe it; we ask them to
   mark it; we tell them that this is the sum and substance of all the
   gospel that we were sent to preach, "God hath set forth Christ to be a
   propitiation for our sins."

   Thus I have opened up the meaning of the word to "show." This is what
   we do. Now the second point is, my brethren:--

   II. WHAT WE SHOW, AND HOW

   It is said in the text, "As often as ye eat this bread and drink this
   cup, ye do show the Lord's death." How do we show it? What do we show?
   Well, first of all, we show that God has set forth Christ for men. The
   table is spread; there is bread on it; there is the cup upon it. What
   for? Not for beasts. Here is the food of men. It is set there for men.
   It is intended that the bread should be eaten, that the wine should be
   drunk. Everybody who sees a table spread knows at once that there are
   preparations for a meal or a festival. Now God has set forth Christ for
   men. There is in Christ what man wants. As bread meets his hunger, as
   the cup meets his thirst, so Christ meets all the spiritual wants of
   mankind. And the soul that would live, and the soul that would rejoice,
   must come to God's provision for his living and his rejoicing, and that
   provision is to be found in Jesus Christ crucified. God set forth
   Christ of old. Even in the garden, he set him forth in the first
   promise. He continued to set him forth by all the prophets, and in this
   last day every veil has been taken away by an open Bible inviting all
   comers. God has set forth the bread of life to the sons of men. And you
   tonight will show that fact. When you see that table uncovered, you
   have a representation. God has made a feast of fat things for the sons
   of men in the person of Jesus Christ. The feast consists of bread and
   wine. Now in this we represent Christ's human person, Christ's
   humanity. That he is no myth, but real flesh, is taught by the bread
   being on the table--that he was no phantom, but that real blood coursed
   through his veins as through ours--that the Lord of life and glory was,
   like ourselves, a real man, in humanity in all respects like to
   ourselves, sin alone excepted. There shall be no phantom feast upon the
   table, and the materialism that is there is meant to show that he was a
   man, a real man

   "Who once on Calvary died,

   When streams of blood and water ran

   Down from his wounded side."

   But the next thing we show forth is his death. We have his person; then
   we have his death--observe how. Recording to the Romish Church, the
   most of the people are only to participate in the bread--the wafer. Now
   such persons never show Christ's death at all, for the text says, "As
   often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye show Christ's death."
   It is only by the two that you show his death at all. The bread
   represents the body, but the cup must represent the blood, or else you
   have no token of his suffering--no emblem of his death. Cannot the two
   be mixed together? No, for if the blood and flesh be together, you have
   the living man. It is when the blood flows--when the lifeblood ebbs
   from the body, and the body is bloodless, that then you have the wine
   as a token of death; and the separation of the two--the use of the two
   emblems--is absolutely needful to set forth death. The more you think
   this the more you see in it. The emblem is the simplest in the world,
   but yet the most instructive. Take either one of the elements--the
   bread, how it typifies Christ's suffering! Here was the corn bruised
   beneath the thresher's flail; then was it cast into the ground. It
   sprung up and ripened, and had to be cut down with the sickle; then it
   had to be threshed; then ground in the mill; then was it baked in the
   oven. A whole series of sufferings, if I may use the term, it had to
   pass through before it became proper food for us. And so must our
   Saviour pass through sufferings innumerable before he could become food
   for our souls, and redeemer of our spirits. As for that which is in the
   cup, it was trodden beneath the foot in the wine-pressits juice was
   pressed forth. So in the wine-press of Jehovah's wrath was Christ
   pressed before he could become the wine that maketh glad both God and
   man. Both emblems represent suffering, each one separately, but put
   together they bring forth the idea of death, "and as often as ye eat
   this bread and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death."

   But more than this; we show that God set forth Christ; we show his
   person as a real man; we show his sufferings and his death; but next we
   show our participation in the same, for it is not "as often as ye look
   at this bread," or "as ye gaze upon this cup," but "as often as ye eat
   this bread and drink this cup." Christ saves us not until we do receive
   him by an act of faith. The bread satisfies no hunger while it rests
   upon the table, and a draught from the cup quenches no thirst until it
   really is drunk. So the precious blood of Jesus Christ our Saviour must
   be received by our faith. We must believe in him to the saving of our
   souls. Now how simple a matter is eating! It matters not, unless a man
   be dead--he wants little teaching to know how to eat. It is as simple
   as a natural act--he puts food into his mouth. It is just so here.
   There is the Saviour, and I take him--that is all. It seems to me to be
   even a more complex act to eat than simply to trust in Jesus, yet is it
   a very simple thing. The idiot can eat. No matter how guilty a man, he
   can eat; no matter how dark and despairing his fears, he can eat; and O
   poor soul, whoever thou mayest be, there shall be no want of wit or
   merit that shall keep thee back from Christ. If thou art willing to
   have him, thou mayest have him. The act of trusting Christ makes Christ
   as much thy own as the eating of the bread. Suppose some difficulty
   were raised about whether a piece of bread was mine. Well, the legal
   question would take a long time to decide. I cannot produce the
   document, nor find the witnesses to prove it is mine. But there is one
   little fact, I think, which will settle it--I have eaten it. So if the
   devil himself were to say that Christ is not mine, I have believed on
   him; and if I have believed on him, he is mine just as surely as when I
   have eaten a piece of bread there can be no question about its being
   mine. Now we set forth to-night, by eating bread and drinking of the
   cup, the fact that Jesus Christ is our Saviour, and we take him by
   simple faith to be our all in all.

   But there is more teaching still. The bread and wine, are being eaten
   and drunk, are assimilated into the system; they minister strength to
   bone, sinew, muscle; they build up the man. And herein is teaching.
   Christ believed in is one with us--"Christ in us the hope of glory. "We
   have heard persons talk of believers falling from grace and losing
   Christ. No, sir, a man has eaten bread--he ate it yesterday. Will you
   separate that bread from the man? Will you trace the drops that came
   from the cup, and fetch them out of the man's system? You shall more
   easily do that than you shall take Christ away from the soul that has
   once fed upon him. "Who shall separate us from the love of God, which
   is in Christ Jesus our Lord?" He is in us a well of water springing up
   into everlasting life. See then how large a letter Christ has written
   to us with these pens--how in this bread and this wine, eaten and
   drunk, he has taught us wondrous mysteries--in fact, the whole
   Christian faith is, in brief, summed up here upon this table.

   And now we must remark upon what it is we show forth, and how we do it.
   We do this very simply. Certain churches must go about this business in
   a very mysterious manner--a great deal of machinery is wanted--a plate
   becomes a paten, and a cup becomes a chalice, and a table, ah! that has
   vanished and turned into an altar. The whole thing is turned
   topsy-turvy until it is very questionable in the Church of Rome whether
   there is any supper at all; for if you introduce the altar, you have
   put away the table and done away with the whole thing. It is another
   ordinance, and not the ordinance which Christ established. One would
   suppose that when the Apostles first went out to preach, if the
   religion of the Romish Church be that of the Scripture, they would have
   needed, each of them, a wagon to carry with them the various
   paraphernalia necessary for the celebration of their services. But
   here, wherever there is a piece of bread, and wherever there is a cup,
   we have the plain, but instructive emblems which our Saviour bade us
   use. "He took bread and break it. "He did drink of the cup, and passed
   it to his disciples, and said, "Drink ye all of it."

   Let us keep this ordinance in its pure simplicity. Let us never add
   anything to it by our own devising by way of fancying that we are
   honouring God by garnishing his table. Let us plainly show Christ's
   death, and as we do it plainly we should also do it festively. Is it
   not delightful to reflect that our Lord has not ordained a mournful
   ceremony in which to celebrate his death: it is a feast. You would
   suppose by the way that some come that it is a funeral, but it is a
   feast, and joy becomes a feast; and when, according to the example of
   Christ, we recline at our ease in the nearest approach to the posture
   in which the Oriental lay along at the table, and when we come with
   joyful heart, blessing the Lord Jesus that though our sins put him to
   death, yet his death has put to death our sins, then it is that we
   celebrate his death as he would have us celebrate it--not as an awful
   tragedy, in which we try to provoke our indignation against the Romans
   or the Jews, but as a hallowed festival, in which the King himself
   comes to the table, and his spikenard gives forth a sweet smell, and
   our spirit is refreshed.

   And once more, this way of showing Christ's death is one of communion.
   Now one person cannot do it; many must come together. Ye must eat and
   drink together to celebrate this, your Lord's death. And is not this
   delightful, for in this cup we have fellowship with him and with one
   another? We, being many, have one bread; we, being many, have one
   cup--one family at one table with one common head, the Lord Jesus, who
   is all in all to us. Oh! I bless his name that whereas he might have
   ordained a way of our showing his death which would have been mournful,
   or a way which would have been solitary, he has selected that which is
   joyful, and that which is full of good fellowship, so that saints below
   and himself can meet together in the festival of love and show his
   death until he come, in the breaking of bread and the pouring forth of
   wine. Thus I have tried to show what it is we show, and how we show it.
   Now thirdly:--

   III. WHO ARE TO SHOW IT?

   Who show it? "As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
   show the Lord's death." The "ye," then includes all the saints of
   God--all who come to the table, who eat this bread and drink this cup;
   and truly a very pleasing thought arises from this. Here is a way of
   showing Christ's death in which all who love Christ have a share. You
   cannot all show it from the pulpit; gifts are not equally distributed;
   but you all alike share in this showing of his death--in this special
   way, which he himself celebrated for our example, and which he
   delivered to his servant Paul, expressly that it might stand on record.
   Now if Paul himself were here, he could not show Christ's death alone
   at the Lord's Supper. He must ask some of his poorer brethren to come
   with him. If the minister of a church should be full of the Holy Ghost,
   yet could he not show forth Christ's death here in this peculiar way.
   He must say to his brethren, "Come, brethren and sisters; it says '
   ye,' as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup." Here we are
   to-night, as we sit here, all brought into a blessed equality in the
   act of using the same outward sign, and of performing the Master's will
   in the same way.

   "But," says ones "doth every man who comes to the table, and eats and
   drinks, show Christ's death? Notice how the verse which follows my text
   puts a bar to that. "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of
   this bread." It must be taken for granted that the man has examined
   himself--that he comes there as a true believer in Jesus--that he comes
   there with the full intent to show Christ's death; and if he does that,
   such a man is showing Christ's death. I am very earnest, dear brethren
   and sisters, as it has been a long time since I have met with
   you--having been kept away so long by sickness, though I have been with
   my brethren below stairs--I am anxious that we should indeed show
   Christ's death to-night. Let us do it to ourselves. I find that the
   text may either be read in the indicative or in the imperative mood. It
   is either "ye show Christ's death," as our version has it, or it may be
   "show ye Christ's death"--it is an exhortation. Oh! let us take care
   that we show it to ourselves. "Show it to ourselves?" says one. Yes, it
   is meant for you. This is a primary meaning of the text. When you take
   that bread, don't think of the bread, and stay there, but say to your
   own soul, "My soul, think thou of Jesus. My heart, go away now to
   Gethsemane. Come, ye stray thoughts; Come, ye passing vanities, begone!
   I must away to where my Saviour bled and died.

   "Sweet the moments, rich in blessing

   Which, before his cross, I spend."

   I have come here to show his death; let me see him. I will ask him to
   permit me in spirit to put my finger into the print of the nails, and
   to put my hand into his side. Oh! go not from this table satisfied with
   the outward emblem; press into the inner court--pray the Master to
   manifest himself to you as he does not unto the world. For here is the
   main business--show his death to your own heart till your heart bleeds
   for sin; show it to your own faith till your faith feels it is all
   sufficient--show it to others. You will be sure to show it to others if
   you show it to yourself for as others look on and mark your reverent
   behaviour; if they cannot enter into your joy, they will be reminded of
   what they have so long forgotten. Oh! brethren and sisters, let me urge
   each one of you that no one should be content without sharing this
   honour. I feel we all have an honour to participate in showing forth
   the death of Christ. Let us not, in sharing the honour, bring
   condemnation on ourselves. But I must hasten on. The fourth point is:--

   IV. WHEN ARE WE TO DO IT?

   The text says "often"--"as often as ye eat this bread." The Holy Spirit
   might have used the words "when ye eat," but he did not. He teaches us
   by implication that we ought to do it often. I do not think there is
   any positive law about it, but it looks to me as if the first
   Christians broke bread almost every day--"breaking bread from house to
   house." I am not sure that that refers to Communion, but in all
   probability it does. This much is certain, that in the early Church the
   custom was to break bread in memory of Christ's passion on the first
   day of every week, and it was always a part of the Sabbath's service
   when they came together to remember their Lord in this way. How it can
   be thought right to leave the celebrating of this ordinance to once a
   year or once a quarter I cannot understand, and it seems to me that if
   brethren knew the great joy there is in often setting forth Christ's
   death they would not be content with even once a month. But I leave
   that.

   The other mark of time in the text is "till he come." Then this service
   is to end. There will be no more Lord's Suppers when Christ appears,
   because they will be needless. Put out the candle--the sun has risen.
   Put away the emblem--here comes Christ himself. But until he does come,
   this will always be a most fitting ordinance. I pleased myself with a
   thought I met with the other day. Our Lord Jesus Christ sat at the
   table and ate with his disciples, and he took the cup and he sipped it,
   and he passed it round. It is being passed round still. It has not got
   round the table yet, it is being passed on. For 1,800 years it has been
   passed from hand to hand. They have not all drunk yet; and you remember
   he, said, "Drink ye all of it"--all of you. Did he speak to all his
   elect that were to be born--to all the countless companies yet to come?
   I think he did, and it is going round: and by-and-bye, when all the
   people of God have participated in Christ, it will cease. The cup will
   never be emptied till then.

   "Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood

   Shall never lose its power,

   Till all the ransomed Church of God

   Be saved, to sin no more."

   When the last has drunk of it, what then? It will come back into the
   Master's hands, and then will be fulfilled that word of his, "I say
   unto you I will not henceforth drink of the juice of the vine till I
   drink it new in my heavenly Father's kingdom." And it is going round,
   brethren--that cup of glorious Christian fellowship of love to Christ,
   the cup that is filled with Jesus' blood--it is passing round, and when
   it has reached his hand then we shall need no more the outward
   ordinance. But until then it is clear from the text that it is to be
   kept up. And I have a little dispute with some of you here present. You
   love the Lord, but you have never been baptized; you love Jesus, but
   you have never come to his table. Now let me say you are in opposition
   to Christ. He says, "Do this till I come", you don't do it. "Oh! but I
   am only one," say you. To your measure of ability you have helped to
   make the lord's Supper obsolete. Can you see that? If you have a right
   to neglect it, so have I--if I, so have all my brethren. Then there is
   an end to it. My dear brother, you are doing the best you can to make
   Christ forgotten in the world. I pray you by his own dying example and
   his express command, "This do ye in remembrance of me"--if ye have
   believed him, keep this, his commandment. If ye have not believed in
   him, then far hence! Ye have no right to take it. But if you have
   believed, I beseech you stand not back for shame or fear, but eat and
   drink at his table till he come.

   Time has gone too fast for me, and I must close. There is one lesson,
   however, that I cannot leave out. Until Christ come. We are taught our
   interim employment--what is to occupy us until Jesus comes. Beloved
   brethren, until Jesus comes we have nothing left but to think of him.
   Till Jesus comes the main thing we have to do is to think of and set
   him forth a crucified Saviour. There is no food for the Church but
   Jesus; there is no testimony to the world but Jesus crucified. They
   have sometimes told us that in this growing age we may expect to have
   developed a higher form of Christianity. Well, they shall have it that
   like it; but Christ himself has left us nothing but just this, "Show my
   death till I come." The preacher is to go on preaching a dying Saviour;
   the saint is to go on trusting that dying Saviour, feeding on him and
   letting his soul be satisfied as with marrow and fatness. There is
   nothing left us to occupy our thoughts, or to be the subject of our
   joy, as our dear dying Lord. Oh! let us feed on him. Each one,
   personally, as a believer--let him feed on his Saviour. If he has come
   once, come again. Keep on coming till Christ himself shall appear. As
   long as the invitation stands let us not slight it, but constantly come
   to Christ himself and feed on him.

   In conclusion, let every ungodly person here know that he has no part
   nor lot in this matter. Thy first business, sinner, is with Christ
   himself. Go thou and put thy trust in him. Oh! go this night. Thou
   mayest never have another night to go in. And then when thou best
   believed, then obey his command in baptism, and then also come to his
   table and show his death until he come. The Lord bless you for Christ's
   sake. Amen.

   A Sermon

   (No. 3502)

   Published on Thursday, March 9th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [10]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the
   Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son,
   and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Come unto me, all ye that
   labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."--Matthew
   11:27-28.

   I HAVE preached to you, dear friends, several times from the words,
   "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give
   you rest." There is such sweetness in the precept, such solace in the
   promise, that I could fain hope to preach from it many times more. But
   I have no intention just now to repeat what I have said in any former
   discourse, or to follow the same vein of thought that we have
   previously explored. This kindly and gracious invitation needs only to
   be held up in different lights to give us different subjects for
   admiration. That it flowed like an anthem from our Saviour's lips we
   perceive, in what connection if was spoken we may properly enquire. He
   had just made some important disclosures as to the covenant relations
   that existed between himself and God the Father. This interesting
   revelation of heavenly truth becomes the basis upon which he offers an
   invitation to the toiling and oppressed children of men, and assigns it
   as a reason why they should immediately avail themselves of his
   succour. Such is the line of discourse I propose now to follow. Kindly
   understand me that I want to deal with the hearts and consciences of
   the unconverted, and, in the power of the Holy Spirit, to plead with
   them that they may at once go to Jesus and find rest unto their souls.
   I shall require no stories or anecdotes, no figures or metaphors, to
   illustrate the urgent necessity of the sinner and the generous bounty
   of the Saviour. We will make it as plain as a pikestaff, and as sharp
   as a sword, with the intention of driving straight at our point. Time
   is precious, your time especially, for you may not have many days in
   which to seek the Lord. The matter is urgent. Oh! that every labouring,
   weary sinner here might at once come to Jesus and find that rest which
   the Saviour expresses himself as so willing to give! With all
   simplicity, then, let me explain to you tile way of salvation, "Come
   unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden."

   The way to be saved is to come to Jesus. To come, to Jesus means to
   pray to him, to trust in him, to rely upon him. Each man who trusts in
   another may be said to come to that other for help. Thus to trust in
   Jesus is to come to him. In order to do this I must give up all
   reliance upon myself, or anything I could do or have done, or anything
   I do feel or can feel. Nor must I feel the slightest dependence upon
   anything that anyone else can do for me. I must cease from creature
   helps and carnal rites, to rest myself upon Jesus. That is what my
   Saviour means when he says, "Come unto me." The exhortation is very
   personal. "Come unto me," says he. He saith not, come to my ministers
   to consult them. nor come to my sacraments to observe them, nor come to
   my Bible to study its teaching--interesting and advantageous as under
   some circumstances any or all of these counsels might be; but he
   invites us in the sweetest tune of friendship, saying, "Come to me."
   For a poor sinner this is the truest means of succour. Let him resort
   to the blessed Lord himself. To trust in a crucified Saviour is the way
   of salvation. Let him leave everything else and fly away to Christ, and
   look at his dear wounds as he hangs upon the cross. I am afraid many
   people are detained from Christ by becoming entangled in the meshes of
   doctrine. Some with heterodox doctrine, others with orthodox doctrine,
   content themselves. They think that they have advanced far enough They
   flatter their souls that they have ascertained the truth! But the fact
   is, it is not the truth as a letter which, saves anybody. It is the
   truth as a person--it is Jesus Christ who is the way, the truth, and
   the life, whom we need to apprehend.

   Our confidences must rest entirely upon him. "Come unto me," saith
   Jesus; Come unto me, and I will give you rest."

   The exhortation is in the present tense. "Come" now; do not wait; do
   not tarry; do not lie at the pool of ordinances but come unto me; come
   now at once, immediately, just where you are, just as you are. Wherever
   the summons finds you, rise without parley, without an instant's delay.
   "Come." I know that the human mind is very ingenious, and it is
   especially perverse when its own destruction is threatened. By some
   means or other it will evade this simple call. "Surely," says one,
   "there must be something to do besides that." Nay, nothing else is to
   be done. No preliminaries are requisite. The whole way of salvation is
   to trust in Jesus. Trust him now. That done, you are saved. Rely upon
   his finished work. know that he has meditated on your behalf. Commit
   thy sinful self to his saving grace. A change of heart shall be yours.
   All that you need he will supply.

   "There is life in a look at the crucified One;

   There is life at this moment for thee."

   So sweet an invitation demands a spontaneous acceptance. Come just as
   you are. "Come unto me," saith Christ. He does not say, "Come when you
   have washed and cleansed yourself." Rather should you come to be
   cleansed. He does not say, "Come when you have clothed yourself and
   made yourself beautiful with good works." Come to be made beautiful in
   a better righteousness than you can wear. Come naked, and let him gird
   thee with fine linen, cover thee with silk, and deck thee with jewels.
   He does not say, "Come when your conscience is tender, come when your
   heart is penitent, when your soul is full of loathing for sin, and your
   mind is enlightened with knowledge and enlivened with joy. But ye that
   labour, ye that are heavy laden, he bids you to come as you are. Come
   oppressed with your burdens, begrimed with your labours, dispirited
   with your toils. If the load that bends you double to the earth be upon
   your shoulders? just come as you are. Take no plea in your mouth but
   this--he bids you come. That shall suffice as a warrant for your
   coming, and a security for your welcome. If Jesus Christ bids you, who
   shall say you nay?

   He puts the matter very exclusively. "Come unto me, all ye that labour
   and are heavy laden." Do nothing else but come to him. Do you want
   rest? Come to him for it. The old proverb hath it that betwixt two
   stools we come to the ground." Certainly, if we trust partly in Christ
   and partly in ourselves, we shall fall lower than the ground. We shall
   sink into hell. "Come unto me" is the whole gospel. "Come unto me." Mix
   nothing with it. Acknowledge no other obedience. Obey Christ, and him
   alone. Come unto me. You cannot go in two opposite directions. Let your
   tottering footsteps bend their way to him alone. Mix anything with him,
   and the possibility of your salvation is gone. Yours be the happy
   resolve:--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring:

   Simply to thy cross I cling."

   This must be your cry if you are to be accepted at all. Come, then, ye
   that labour, ye horny-handed sons of toil. Come ye to Jesus. He invites
   you. Ye that stew and toil for wealth, ye merchants, with your many
   cares, labourers ye are. He bids you come. Ye students, anxious for
   knowledge, chary of sleep, burning out the midnight oil. Ye labour with
   exhausted brains; therefore, come. Come from struggling after fame. Ye
   pleasure--seekers, come; perhaps there is no harder toil than the toil
   of the man who courts recreation and thinks he is taking his ease.
   Come, ye that labour in any form or fashion; come to Jesus--to Jesus
   alone. And ye that are heavy laden; ye whose official duties are a
   burden; ye whose domestic cares are a burden; ye whose daily toils are
   a burden; ye whose shame and degradation are a burden, all ye that are
   heavy laden, come and welcome. If I attach no exclusive spiritual
   signification to these terms, it is because there is nothing in the
   chapter that would warrant such a restriction. Had Christ said, "Some
   of you that labour and are heavy laden may come," I would have said
   "some" too. Howbeit he has not said "some," but "all" "that labour and
   are heavy laden." It is wonderful how people twist this text about.
   They alter the sense by misquoting the words. They say, "Come ye that
   are weary and heavy laden." After this manner some have even intended
   to define a character rather than to describe condition, so they shut
   out some of those who labour from the kind invitation. But let the
   passage stand in its own simplicity. Let any sinner here, who can say,
   "I labour," though he cannot say spiritually labour, come on the bare
   warrant of the word as he finds it written here; he will not be
   disappointed of the mercy promised. Christ will not reject him. Himself
   hath said it, "Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." And
   any man that is heavy laden, even though it may not be a spiritual
   burden that oppresses him, yet if he comes heavy laden to Christ, he
   certainly shall find relief. That were a wonder without precedent or
   parallel, such as was never witnessed on earth throughout all the
   generations of men, that a soul should come to Jesus, be rebuffed, and
   told by him, "I never called you, I never meant you; you are not the
   character; you may not come." Hear, O heaven! witness, O earth! such
   thing was never heard of. No, nor ever shall it be heard of in time or
   in eternity. That any sinner should come to the Saviour by mistake is
   preposterous. That Jesus should say to him, "Go your way; I never
   called for you," is incredible. How can ye thus libel the sinner's
   friend? Come, ye needy--come, ye helpless--come, ye simple--come, ye
   penitent--come, ye impenitent--come, ye who are the very vilest of the
   vile. If you do but come, Jesus Christ will receive you, welcome you,
   rejoice over you, and verify to you his thrice blessed promise, "Him
   that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out."

   Now to the tug of war. It shall be my main endeavour to press the
   invitation upon you, my good friends, by the arguments which the
   Saviour used.

   Kindly look at the text. Read the words for yourselves. Do you not see
   that the reason why you are solemnly bidden to come to Christ is
   because:--

   I. HE IS THE APPOINTED MEDIATOR.

   "All things are delivered unto me of my Father." God, even the Father,
   your Creator, against whom you have transgressed, has appointed our
   Lord Jesus Christ to be the way of access for a sinner to himself. He
   is no amateur Saviour. He has not thrust himself into the place
   officiously. He is officially delegated. In times of distress, every
   man is at liberty to do his best for the public welfare; but the
   officer commissioned by his Sovereign is armed with a supreme right to
   give counsel or to exercise command. Away there in Bengal, if there are
   any dying of famine, and I have rice, I may distribute it of my own
   will at my own charge. But the commissioner of the district has a
   special warranty which I do not posses; he has a function to discharge;
   it is his business, his vocation; he is authorised by the Government,
   and responsible to the Government to do it. So the Lord Jesus Christ
   has not only a deep compassion of heart for the necessities of men, but
   he has God's authority to support him. The Father delivered all things
   into his hands, and appointed him to be a Saviour. All that Christ
   teaches has this superlative sanction. He teaches you nothing of his
   own conjecture. "What I have heard of the Father," he saith, "that
   reveal I unto you." The gospel is not a scheme of his suggestion. He
   reveals it fresh from the heart of God. Remember that the promises
   Christ makes are not merely his surmises, but they are promises with
   the stamp of the court of heaven upon them. Their truth is guaranteed
   by God. It is not possible they should fail. Sooner might heaven and
   earth pass away than one word of his fall flat to the ground. Your
   Saviour, O sinner--your only Saviour--is one whose teachings, whose
   invitations, and whose promises have the seal royal of the King of
   kings upon them. What more do you want? Moreover, the Father has given
   all things into his hands in the sense of government. Christ is king
   everywhere. God has appointed Christ to be a mediatorial prince over
   all of us--I say over us all--not merely over those who accept his
   sovereignty, but even over the ungodly. He hath given him power over
   all flesh, that he may give eternal life to as many as he has given
   him. It is of no use your rebelling against Christ, and saying, "We
   will not have him"--the old cry, "We will not have this man to reign
   over us." How read ye in the second Psalm "Why do the heathen rage, and
   the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves,
   and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord, and against his
   anointed. Yet have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion. "Christ is
   supreme. You will have either to submit to his sceptre willingly, or
   else to be broken by his iron rod like a potter's vessel. Which shall
   it be? Thou must either bow or be broken; make your choice. You must
   bend or break. God help you wisely to resolve and gratefully relent.
   Has the Father appointed Christ to stand between him and his sinful
   creatures? Has he put the government upon his shoulders, and given him
   a name called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty, the everlasting King?
   Is he Emmanuel, God with us, in God's stead? With what reverence are we
   bound to receive him!

   Moreover, all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, of mercy and
   goodness, are laid up in Christ. You recollect when Pharaoh had corn to
   sell in Egypt, what reply he made to all who applied to him, "Go to
   Joseph." It would have been no use saying, "Go to Joseph," if Joseph
   had not the keys of the garner; but he had, and there was no garner
   that could be opened in Egypt unless Joseph lent the key. In like
   manner, all the garners of mercy are under the lock and key of Jesus
   Christ, "who openeth, and no man shutteth; who shutteth, and no man
   openeth." When you require any bounty or benefit of God, you must
   repair to Jesus for it. The Father has put all power into his hands. He
   has committed the entire work of mercy to his Son, that through him as
   the appointed mediator, all blessings should be dispensed to the praise
   of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the
   beloved. "Now, sirs, do you want to be saved? I charge you to say
   whether you do or not; for if you care not for salvation, why should I
   labour among you? If you choose your own ruin, you need no counsel; you
   will make sure of it by your own neglect. But if you want salvation,
   Christ is the only authorized person in heaven and earth who can save
   you. "There is no other name, given among men whereby we must be
   saved." The Father hath delivered all things into his keeping. He is
   the authorised Saviour. "Come unto me, then, "all ye that labour and
   are heavy laden." This argument is further developed by another
   consideration: Christ is:--

   II. A WELL-FURNISHED MEDIATOR,

   "All things are delivered unto me," he said, "of my Father. "Sum up all
   that the sinner wants, and you will find him able to supply you with
   all. You want pardon; it is delivered unto Christ of the Father. You
   want change of heart; it is delivered unto Christ of the Father. You
   want righteousness in which you may be accepted; Christ has it. You
   want to be purged from the love of sin; Christ can do it. You want
   wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. It is all in
   Christ. You are afraid that if you start on the road to heaven, you
   cannot hold on. Persevering grace is in Christ. You think you will
   never be perfect; but perfection is in Christ, for all believers, being
   saints of God and servants of Christ, are complete in him. Between
   hell-gate and heaven-gate there is nothing a sinner can need that is
   not treasured up in his blessed person. "It pleased the Father that in
   him should all fulness dwell." He is "full of grace and truth." Oh!
   sinner, I wish I could constrain you to feel as I do now, that had I
   never come to Christ before, I must come to him now, just now. Directly
   I understand that:--

   "Thou, O Christ, art all I want,

   More than all in thee I find."

   Why, then, should I not come? Is it because I want something before I
   come? Make the question your own. Where are you going to seek it? All
   things are delivered unto Christ. To whom should you go for ought you
   crave? Is there another who can aid you when Christ is in possession of
   all? Do you want a tender conscience? Come to Christ for it. Do you
   want to feel the guilt of your sin? Come to Christ to be made sensitive
   to its shame. Are you just what you ought not to be? Come to Christ to
   be made what you ought to be, for everything is in Christ. Is there
   any, thing that can be obtained elsewhere and brought to him? The
   invitation to you is founded upon the explanation that accompanies it.
   "All things are delivered unto me of my Father"; therefore, Come unto
   me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
   The argument is so exclusive, that it only wants a willing mind to make
   it welcome. Only let God the Holy Spirit bless the word, and sinners
   will come to Christ, for unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
   Now note the next argument. Come to Christ, ye labouring ones,
   because:--

   III. HE IS AN INCONCEIVABLY GREAT MEDIATOR.

   Where do I get that? Why, from this--that no man knows him but the
   Father. So great is he, so good, so full of all manner of precious
   store for needy sinners. No man knows him but the Father. He is too
   excellent for our puny understanding to estimate his worth. None but
   the infinite God can comprehend his value as a Saviour. Has anyone here
   been saying, "Christ cannot save me; I am such a big sinner"? You don't
   know him, my friend you don't know him. You are measuring him according
   to your little insignificant notions. High as the heavens are above the
   earth so high are his ways above your ways, and his thoughts than your
   thoughts. You don't know him, sinner, and no one does know him but his
   Father. Why, some of us who have been saved by him, thought when we saw
   the blessed mystery of his substitutionary sacrifice, that we knew all
   about him; but we have found that he grows upon our view the nearer we
   approach, and the more we contemplate him. Some of you have now been
   Christians for thirty or forty years, and you know much more of him
   than you used to do; but you do not know him yet; your eyes are dazzled
   by his brightness; you do not know him. And the happy spirits before
   the throne who have been there, some of them, three or four thousand
   years, have hardly begun to spell the first letter of his name. He is
   too grand and too good for them to comprehend. I believe that it will
   be, the growing wonder in eternity to find out how precious a Christ,
   how powerful, how immutable--in a word, how divine a Christ he is. in
   whom we have trusted. Only the infinite can understand the infinite.
   "God only knows the love of God,"and only the Father understands the
   Son. Oh! I wish I had a week in which to talk on this, instead of a few
   minutes! You want a great Saviour? Well, here he is. Nobody can depict
   him, or describe him, or even imagine him, except the infinite God
   himself. Come, then, poor sinner, sunken up to your neck in crime,
   black as hell--come unto him. Come, all ye that labour and are heavy
   laden, and prove him to be your Saviour. The fact that no one knows how
   great a Saviour he is except his Father may encourage you. Now for
   another argument. Come to him because:--

   IV. HE IS AN INFINITELY WISE MEDIATOR.

   He is a mediator who understands both persons on whose behalf he
   mediates. He understands you. He has summed and reckoned you up, and he
   has made you out to be a heap sin and misery, and nothing else. The
   glory of it is that he understands God, whom you have offended, for it
   is written, "Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son," and he
   knows the Father. Oh! what a mercy that is to have one to go before God
   for me who knows him intimately. He knows his Father's will; he knows
   his Father's wrath. No man knows it but himself. He has suffered it. He
   knows his Father's love. He alone can feel it--such love as God felt
   for sinners. He knows how his Father's wrath has been turned away by
   his precious blood; he knows the Father as a Judge whose anger no
   longer burns against those for whom the Atonement has been made. He
   knows the Father's heart. He knows the Father's secret purposes. He
   knows the Father's will is that whosoever seeth the Son and believeth
   on him shall have everlasting life. He knows the decrees of God, and
   yet he says, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
   I will give, you rest." There is nothing in that contrary to the
   decrees of God; for Jesus knows what the decrees are, and he would not
   speak in contradiction to them. He knows God's requirements. Sinner,
   whatever it is God requires of you, Christ knows what they are, and he
   is ready to meet them. "The law is holy, and just, and good," and Jesus
   knows it, for the, law is in his heart. Justice is very stern, and
   Jesus knows it, for Jesus has felt the edge of the sword of justice,
   and knows all about it. He is fully equipped for the discharge of his
   mediatorial office, and those that put their trust in him shall find
   that he will bear them through. Often, when a prisoner at the bar has a
   barrister who understands his work, and is perfectly competent for the
   defense, his friends say to him, "Your case is safe, for if there is a
   man in England who can get you through, it is that man." But my Master
   is an advocate who never lost a case. He has a plea at the throne of
   God that never failed yet. Give him--oh! give him your cause to plead,
   nor doubt the Father's grace. Poor sinner, he is so wise an advocate
   that you may well come to him, and he will give you rest. But I must
   not weary you, although there is a fulness of matter on which I might
   enlarge. With one other argument I conclude:--

   V. HE IS AN INDISPENSABLE MEDIATOR.

   The only mediator, so the text says. "Neither knoweth any man the
   Father, save the Son." Christ knows the Father; no one else knows him,
   save the Son. There is none other that can approach unto God. It is
   Christ for your Saviour, or no Saviour at all. Salvation is in no
   other; and if you will not have Christ, neither can you have salvation.
   Observe how that is. It is certain that no man knows God except Christ.
   It is equally certain that no man can come, to God except by Christ. He
   says it peremptorily; "No man cometh to the Father but by me." Not less
   certain is it that no man can please the Father except through Christ,
   for "without faith it is impossible to please him." No faith is worth
   having except the grace that is founded and based upon the Lord Jesus
   Christ, and him only. Oh! then, souls, since you are shut up to it by a
   blessed necessity, say at once, "I will to the gracious Prince
   approach, and take Jesus to be my all in all. "If I might hope you
   would do this early, I could go back to my home and retire to my bed,
   praising God for the work that was done, and the result that was
   achieved. Let us reiterate again and again the gospel we have to
   declare, the very essence of the gospel it is which we proclaim. Trust
   your souls with Jesus, and your souls are saved. He suffered in the
   room, and place, and stead of all that trust him. If you rely upon him
   by an act of simple faith, the simplest act in all the world,
   immediately you so rely you are forgiven, your transgressions are
   blotted out for his name's sake. He stands in spirit among us at this
   good hour, and says, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
   laden"; and he gives you these arguments, which ought to convince you.
   I pray they may. He is an authorized Saviour, and a well-furnished
   Saviour. He is the friend of God, and the friend of man. God grant you
   may accept him, and find the boon which he alone can bestow. Amen.

                                Joy in Salvation

   A Sermon

   (No. 3503)

   Published on Thursday, March 16th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [11]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, July 30th, 1871.

   "I will rejoice in thy salvation."--Psalm 9:4.

   I DESIRE to continue the topic of the morning, only we will look at
   another side of the same important matter.

   We spoke this morning, as you have not forgotten, upon these words,
   "Your own salvation." I trust most of us--would God I could hope all of
   us--were earnest about our own personal salvation. To those who are
   earnest this second text will be the complement of the first. They
   desire that their own salvation shall be secure; it is their own
   salvation when they obtain it; but here is the guide as to what is the
   right salvation--what our own salvation ought to be. It is not our own
   in another sense; it is God's. "I will rejoice in thy salvation." While
   it becomes our own by an act of faith, it is not our own so that we can
   claim any merit or take any part of the glorying to ourselves. The only
   salvation that is worth being our own is that which is God's. "I will
   rejoice in thy salvation." Having this morning somewhat at length
   explained what salvation is, showing that it was not a mere deliverance
   from wrath to come, but from the present wrath of God, and yet more
   essentially from sin, from the power of evil within us, there is no
   need that we should go over that again, I trust; but we shall begin by
   noticing the speciality which is in the text, dwelling upon the divine
   salvation. "I will rejoice in thy salvation." So, then, we look at once
   at:--

   I. A DIVINE SALVATION.

   The salvation we have already spoken of is God's, and it is God's
   salvation in many ways. It was his in the planning. None but himself
   could have planned it. In his infinite wisdom he devised it. The
   salvation which is revealed in the person of Jesus Christ, in the
   gospel is every part of it in all its architecture the fruit of divine
   skill. We may say, "Or with whom took he counsel, and who instructed
   him, and who taught him knowledge?" In every part the divine hand may
   be seen; it is of God's planning and ordaining, or ever the earth was.
   So is it of God's providing. You have salvation wrapped up in the gift
   of the person of Jesus Christ. All of it lies in Christ. Because he
   died, our sin is put away. Because he lives, we shall live also. And
   Christ is the pure gift of God. All salvation is in him, and,
   therefore, all salvation is thus procured by God. It is God's
   salvation. And what is more, God not only plans and procures, but he
   also applies salvation. I believe in free agency, but I never yet met
   with a Christian man who was able to say that he came to Christ of his
   own free will without being drawn by the Spirit of God. Whatever our
   doctrinal view may be, the experimental fact is the same in every case.
   All believers will confess that they are God's workmanship, created
   anew in Christ Jesus. "No man can come unto me except the Father which
   hath sent me draw him." There is a want of power. "Ye will not come
   unto me that ye might have life." There is a want of will, and the
   Spirit of God, therefore, applies the salvation which God has planned,
   and which God has provided. And as the first application of this
   salvation is of God, so is it all the way through. I do not believe,
   dear brethren, that our religion is like the action of a clock wound up
   at first by a superior hand, and then left to go alone. No! every day
   the Holy Ghost must continue to work upon us, and in us, to will and to
   do according to God's good pleasure. And if you and I should ever get
   right up to the gate of pearl, and should hear the songs of the blessed
   within that gate, we should not be able to take the last step, but
   should turn back to our sin and folly even, if he that began a good
   work in us should cease to carry it on. He is Alpha and Omega, the
   beginning and the ending. "Salvation is of the Lord," from first to
   last. He makes the rough draft of it, in conviction, upon our
   conscience; he goes on to complete the picture; and if there be one
   touch in the picture that is not of God, it is a blot upon it. If there
   be anything of the flesh, it will have to be wiped out; it is not
   consistent with the work of God. Of God is it in all respects. Now we
   know that this salvation is of God, not only because we are told that
   he planned it, and provided it, and applies it, but because it has the
   marks of God upon it. There is a certain line of poetry; I know it is
   Shakespeare's. Well, you know, I cannot quite tell you why, but yet I
   am sure no one ever wrote exactly in that way. I am reading the Psalms
   through, and I read and I say, "That is David's." I observe certain
   critics who say, "No, this belongs to the time of the captivity." I am
   certain it does not. And why? Because there is a Davidic ring about it,
   you know. The son, of Jesse, and he alone, could have said such things.
   Now in salvation there are the marks of divine authorship. I once saw a
   painting by Titan at Venice, and he had written, "Fecit, fecit Titian."
   He claimed it twice over, as if to make sure that someone else should
   not claim it. And God has put it three times over that there should be
   no doubt whatever that salvation is of God, and he must have the glory
   of it. Now observe the marks of God--what I may call the broad arrow of
   the King--set on salvation. It is full of mercy. Here is salvation for
   the blackest of sinners--salvation for all manner of sin--forgiveness
   for all manner of sin--salvation so full of grace that only God could
   have conceived it. "Who is a pardoning God like thee?" But this
   salvation is equally congenial with justice, for God never absolutely
   forgives a sin. There is always punishment for sin in every case. Jesus
   Christ, the Substitute, comes in and satisfies Justice before the word
   is spoken to the sinner, "Thy transgression is blotted out." In the
   salvation which God has provided on the cross by the death of his dear
   Son there is as much justice as there is mercy; and there is an
   infinity of both. Now this is God-like. Man, if he brings out one
   quality, usually clouds another with it; but God exhibits his character
   in harmonious completeness--as merciful as if he were not just, and as
   just as if he were not gracious. In the gospel, on this account, five
   see also divine wisdom. Whatever some may say about the doctrine of
   substitution, Christ is still the power of God and the wisdom of God.
   The way, so simple, yet so sublime, by which God is just, and yet the
   justifier of him that believeth, exhibits the infinite wisdom of the
   Most High.

   But I won't keep you by mentioning all the divine attributes. It is
   certain they all shine in the gospel, nor can any tell which of the
   letters best is writ--the power, the wisdom, or the grace. They are all
   there, proving the salvation to be of God.

   And there is one other matter. True salvation is of God because it
   draws toward God. If thou hast God's salvation, thou art being drawn
   towards thy heavenly Father, nearer and nearer every day. The ungodly
   forget God; the awakened seek God; but the saved rejoice in God. Ask
   thyself this question, Couldst thou live without God? The ungodly man
   would be happier without God than he is with. It would be the best
   piece of news in the newspaper to thousands, if we could publish it
   to-morrow, that God was dead. To ungodly men it would be like ringing
   the bells of universal Joy; they would run riot after their own will.
   And where would the believer be? He would be an orphan. His sun would
   be blotted out; his hopes would be dead and buried. Judge by this
   whether thou art saved. If thou art saved, thou art drawn to God, thou
   seekest to be like God, thou desirest to honour God. If there be none
   of these things in thee, then I charge thee see to it, for thou art in
   the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. God have mercy
   upon thee! I need not further say that the salvation is of God, and God
   must have all the glory of it. All on earth who are saved, and all in
   heaven who are saved, will ascribe their salvation entirely to the ever
   blessed God, and join with Jonah, who in the very depths of the sea
   made this, his confession of faith, "Salvation is of the Lord." But
   now, secondly, our text (having noticed the divine salvation in it)
   has:--

   II. AN OUTSPOKEN AVOWAL.

   "I will rejoice in thy salvation." Here is someone springing out from
   the common crowd and saying, "I have heard of God's salvation; I will
   rejoice in it! I will rejoice in it! Some despise it. They hear it, and
   they turn a deaf ear. When they have listened to it longest, they are
   most weary of it. But I will rejoice in thy salvation." Here is a
   distinguished character, who is made so, doubtless, by distinguishing
   grace. Oh! I hope there are many of us here who could stand up and
   say--if this were the time and place--"Let others say what they will,
   and count the cross a thing to mock at, and Jesus Christ to be
   forgotten, I am his servant; I will rejoice in his salvation." There
   are some that rest in another salvation. We all did so once. But he who
   speaks in the text throws aside self-righteousness as filthy rags. He
   puts it all aside, and says, "I will rejoice in thy salvation." If I
   were righteous, I would not say so. Had I a perfect holiness, I would
   not mention it in comparison with the righteousness of Christ; but
   being an unworthy sinner, without a single merit of my own, I will not
   be so foolish as to patch up a fictitious righteousness, but I will
   rejoice in thy salvation. You see them there!--those worshippers of the
   scarlet woman--they are resting in their priest! He puts on millinery,
   blue, pink, scarlet, white, and I know not what--all kinds of little
   toys to please fools with. And there be some that rejoice in that
   salvation that comes from an "infallible" sinner--that comes from a
   sham priest of God. But we are looking to Christ, who stands before the
   eternal throne and pleads the merits of his own blood. We say:--

   "Let all the forms that men devise

   Assault our faith with treacherous art,

   We'll Can them vanity and lies

   And bind the gospel to our heart."

   "I will rejoice in thy salvation." There may be some tonight to whom I
   shall speak who are rejoicing in God's salvation through his abundant
   grace who have very little else to rejoice in. You are very poor. Ah!
   how welcome you are to this house! How glad I am that you have come. I
   feel it always a joy that the people have the gospel preached to them.
   Well, you have no broad acres, you have no gold rings on your fingers;
   you come in the garb of toil. Never mind, my brother, lay hold on
   eternal life and say, "I will rejoice in thy salvation." Perhaps you
   are sick to-night--your poor weak body could scarcely drag itself up to
   the assembly of God's people. Well, well, it is a heavy thing to have
   to suffer so, but if you cannot rejoice in a hale body, yet rejoice in
   his salvation. Look to-night to Jesus; put your trust in him alone, and
   you will have a sufficient well-spring of joy, if you have nothing
   else. Possibly some of you who lay hold on Christ and rejoice in him
   will have hard times of it at home your father will mock at you, your
   mother will not sympathise with you; your workmates to-morrow, if they
   hear that you are converted, will laugh, and jest, and jeer at you.
   What say you? Are you a coward? Will you back out of it because it
   demands a sacrifice? Oh! if it be so, then you are indeed unworthy of
   the name, and you count yourself so; but if you are what you should be,
   you will say, "Let them; laugh at me as they will, and spit upon me as
   they please, I will rejoice in thy salvation."

   "If on my face for thy dear name,

   Shame and reproach may be;

   I'll hail reproach and welcome shame,

   For thou'lt remember me."

   It takes some pluck, but we ought to have it in the cause of Christ.
   Your mean, miserable wretches that will only go out to follow Christ in
   sunny weather, and get them gone again when a cloud darkens the sky,
   deserve well the wrath that comes upon them. They are like the
   Nautilus, very well on the placid sea, but the first billow that arises
   they furl their sails and drop into the deep, and are seen no more. Oh!
   beware, beware, beware of a sunny-weather religion; beware of a
   religion that will not stand the fire; but be you such that, if all the
   world forsook Christ, you would say, "I will rejoice in his salvation";
   and if you were turned out of doors, if you were turned out of the
   world itself, and thought not fit, to live, you would yet be content to
   have it so, if you might be numbered with the people of God, and be
   permitted to rejoice in his salvation. Does this, as I try to speak it,
   awaken a holy emotion in any soul here? Is there someone who has been a
   stranger to my Lord who to-night can say, "I desire to rejoice in his
   salvation"? I cannot forget, when I sat as a young lad under the
   gallery of a little place of worship, hearing the gospel simply
   preached--the blessed moment when I was led to resolve to follow
   Christ. I have never been ashamed of having done so. I have never had
   to regret it. He is a blessed Master. He has handled me roughly lately,
   but he is a blessed Master. I would follow at his heels if only like a
   dog, for it is better to be his dog than to be the devil's darling. He
   is a blessed Master. Let him say what he will, and do what he will. Oh!
   is there no young man here, no youth, no child, no girl; is there no
   gray-headed one who will say, "I will rejoice in thy salvation" O
   eternal Spirit, come and touch some heart, and make this, their
   spiritual birthright, that they may say, "I--I--I will rejoice in thy
   salvation."

   But we must pass on, for time presses. We have, in the third place, to
   consider in the text:--

   III. A DELIGHTFUL EMOTION.

   We have noticed the divine salvation, and the outspoken avowal; now we
   will notice the delightful emotion. "I will rejoice in thy salvation."
   It is an unfortunate thing that Christianity gets associated with
   melancholy. I will not forbid the banns, for they are not very near of
   kin, but I wish they were further apart every day. It is a good thing
   for the melancholy to become a Christian; it is an unfortunate thing
   for the Christian to become melancholy. If there is any man in the
   world that has a right to have a bright, clear face and a flashing eye,
   it is the man whose sins are forgiven him, and who is saved with God's
   salvation. In order for any man, however, to rejoice in God's
   salvation, he must, first of all, know it. There must be an intelligent
   apprehension of what it is. Next, he must grasp it by an act of faith
   as his own. Then, having grasped it, he must study it to know the price
   at which it was bought, and all the qualities--the divine qualities
   that follow from it. Then he must hold it fast, and seek to get out the
   sweetness from it. What is there in God's salvation that should make us
   rejoice? I do not know what to select, for it is all joy and all
   rejoicing. It is enough to make our heart to ring with joy to think
   that there should be a salvation at all for such poor souls as we are.
   We may well hang out all the streamers of our spirits, and strew the
   streets of our soul with flowers, for King Jesus has come to dwell
   there. Ring every bell; give him a glorious welcome. Let all the soul
   be glad when Jesus enters and brings salvation with him, for the
   salvation of Christ is so suitable that we may well rejoice in it. Dear
   brother, if you are saved, I know the salvation of Christ suited you.
   It did me--exactly--it was made on purpose for me. I am as sure of it
   as if there were no other sinner to be saved. It was the gospel that
   brought power to the weak, nay, it brought life to the dead; it brought
   everything to those that had nothing; it is just the sort of gospel for
   a penniless, bankrupt sinner like myself. We rejoice in the suitability
   of the gospel; we rejoice in the freeness of it. We have nothing to
   pay; we have no price to pay, neither of promise, nor of anything that
   was our own. Salvation was freely given to us in Christ Jesus. Let us
   rejoice in it, then. Oh! rejoice in the richness of that salvation.
   When the Lord pardoned our sins, he did not pardon half of them, and
   leave some of them on the book, but with one stroke of the pen he gave
   a full receipt for all our debts. When we went down into the fountain
   filled with blood, and washed, we did not come up half-clean, but there
   was no spot nor wrinkle upon us--we were white as driven snow. Glory be
   to God for such a rich salvation as this. And he did not in that day
   save us with a perhaps and a chance salvation that set us on a rock,
   and say, "Keep yourself there--you must depend upon yourselves", but
   this was the covenant he made with us, "A new heart also will I give
   thee, and a right spirit will I put within thee." It was a complete
   salvation, which would not permit a failure. The salvation, which is
   given to the soul that believes is on this wise, "I give unto my sheep
   eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them
   out of my hand." "The water that I shall give him shall be a well of
   water springing up unto everlasting life." I believe the perseverance
   of the saints to be the very gem of the gospel. I could not hold the
   truth of Scripture if this could be disproved to me, for every page
   seems to have this upon it, if nothing else, that "the righteous shall
   hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and
   stronger." In this my soul rejoices, that I have a salvation to preach
   to you which, if you receive it, will effectually save you if your
   hearts are given to Christ, and will keep you, and preserve you, and
   bring you into the eternal kingdom of his glory. I will rejoice in the
   certain and abiding character of that salvation. Oh! there is enough in
   the salvation of Christ to make heaven full of bliss; there is enough
   to make us full of praise. Let us take up the theme; let us talk by the
   way to one another about it; let us talk to sinners about it; let us
   recommend religion by our cheerfulness. Levity be far from us, but
   happiness let it be the happiest sphere in which we live if we have
   little else to rejoice in, we have enough here. Whatever may be our
   condition or prospects, we may still rejoice in God's salvation, and
   let us not fail to be filled with this most blissful emotion.

   And now I must close. The text has in it a word of the future which we
   must not quite overlook. Here is a joyful gospel, "I will rejoice in
   thy salvation." You may read it if you like, "I shall"--"I shall" or "I
   will"--it would be quite right. The Hebrew has no present. It seems to
   have given up all tenses--like God himself who was, and is, and is to
   come. I shall rejoice in thy salvation. Now here is:

   IV. A BLESSED PROSPECT.

   You may live to grow old; well, we shall never grow weary of Christ. If
   we are his people, we shall never have any cause to part from him; "I
   will rejoice in thy salvation." I could bring up to this platform an
   aged brother whom all of you would know, who has infirmities and has
   age creeping upon him, but there is not a happier soul in this house
   than he; and when I had made him speak to you, I could bring you many
   more aged women too, and I would ask them what they think of Christ,
   and I am sure they would say with greater emphasis than I can, "I will
   rejoice in thy salvation." I almost wish my grandfather were alive and
   behind me to-night, for on one occasion I preached with him in the
   pulpit, and when I came to speak of experience he pulled my coat-tail
   and came to the front, and said,"My grandson can tell you that he
   believes it, but I can tell you experimentally," and on the old
   gentleman went with it. Well, many an aged Christian can tell you he
   has rejoiced in God's salvation. He does rejoice, and, instead of age
   making the joy of his youth to become dim, it has mellowed and
   sweetened the fruit, which was sweet even at the first. Oh! that we
   may, when these hairs grow hoar with years, and the snows of many
   winters lie white upon our head, may we still rejoice in God's
   salvation. But then, whether we reach old age or not, there is one
   thing that is certain--we shall assuredly die, and when we come to die,
   what shall we do? I know what you are thinking of. You say, "I should
   groan." Ay, sinner, you are thinking of the friend that is wiping away
   the clammy sweat from the brow and those closed eyes. Now those may
   never occur. We often hear them mentioned in reference to dying beds,
   but they are not so constantly there as to be, necessary. And if they
   were there' if we did lose sight itself before life fails--what then?
   Why, the vision of the Christ, who is our salvation, and in whom we
   rejoice, shall then be more gloriously clear and radiantly beautiful,
   because the sights and sounds of earth have vanished from us.

   Now, instead of looking at these outward parts of dying, think of this,
   "I will rejoice in thy salvation." When I parted from our dear brother,
   Cook, a few days ago, he could not say much. He was very, very weak,
   but what he did say was just this, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is all." Well,
   I talked, and read, and prayed, and so on, and when we had done, he
   simply said, "The blood--the blood, the blood--that is all my hope."
   Why, he looked as calm in prospect of dying as any of you do in sitting
   here, and was as delighted with the hope of being where Jesus is as
   ever bride was at the coming of the marriage day. It was delightful to
   see the blessed calm and peace that was upon that man of God. And when
   I come to die, whoever I may be, however little my standing in the
   Church of God is, if I am in Christ, I will rejoice in his salvation; I
   will make the dark valley ring with his praises; I will make the river
   of death itself to roll back as the Red Sea did of old, with my
   triumphant songs; I will enter heaven with this upon my heart and upon
   my lip,'I will rejoice in thy salvation! Worthy is the Lamb that was
   stain to receive honour, and power, and dominion, and glory for ever
   and ever!" And, brethren, if that is what we may do in dying, this is
   what we shall do for ever and ever, "I will rejoice in thy salvation."
   Millions of ages, throughout all the cycles of years that interpose ere
   Christ delivers up the kingdom to God, even the Father, and then
   onward, even through eternity, this always shall be our own ground of
   rejoicing, "I will rejoice in thy salvation."

   Now I cannot come and stand at the door and speak to everyone as the
   congregation withdraws, but if it were possible I should like to stand
   there and shake the hand of everyone that has been in the house
   to-night, and say, "Well, friend, how fares it with you?" Can you say,
   'I will rejoice in thy salvation?'" If I cannot do that, I wish it were
   possible to speak in the silent shades of night to you when you awoke,
   so that you might hear a voice ringing in your ears, "Do you rejoice in
   God's salvation?" Perhaps some of you may have come a long distance
   across the sea. You may be by-and-by on shipboard again. It may be that
   you will be in peril, or it may be that afterwards you shall be in
   sickness. Well, may this evening's congregation in this day of July
   rise up before your minds, and if you forget the preacher (and that
   will not matter), yet if you hear a voice that says, "Can you rejoice
   in God's salvation?" I hope that, even if it is twenty years to come,
   it may then be as the voice of God to your soul, and bring you to the
   Saviour. But better far would it be if you would come to him tonight
   and you may. May the Spirit of God bring you! Whosoever believeth on
   the Lord Jesus Christ hath everlasting life. The whole of the gospel is
   wrapped up in Christ's message, which he has sent by his apostles, "He
   that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." To you each
   this--this--is the word, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
   shalt be saved, and thy house." God add his own blessing, for Christ's
   sake. Amen.

   A Sermon

   (No. 3504)

   Published on Thursday, March 23rd, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [12]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, August 22nd, 1889.

   "And Ittai answered the king, and said, as the Lord liveth, and as my
   lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be,
   whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be."--2
   Samuel 15:21.

   SOME men have a very remarkable power of creating and sustaining
   friendship in others. David was a man brimming over with affection--a
   man, notwithstanding all his rough soldier-life, of an exceedingly
   tender heart--a man, I was about to say--the word was on my tongue--a
   man of vast humanity. I mean, there was a great deal of manhood about
   him. He was all that other men are, had suffered their sorrows, and had
   tasted their joys, and, there fore, I suppose it was that he had a
   large power of attraction about him, and brought others to himself.

   But there is one Man more than man, whose attracting influence is
   greater than that of all men put together. In the person of the Lord
   Jesus Christ we see gentleness, meekness, and tenderest affection, and
   we see the most hearty sympathy with everything that belongs to
   manhood. Such a vast heart has the Master, such boundless,
   disinterested affection, such human sympathy; so near is he to every
   one of us in his life, and in his experiences, that he attracts the
   sons of men to himself, and when he is lifted up he draws men unto him,
   and afterwards, by the cords of his love, he draws them unto himself.
   It is in the hope that some here may feel the sweet attractions of
   Christ that I have selected this text, anxiously praying that some here
   may so give themselves to Christ s never to leave him: and that others
   who have already done may be confirmed in their solemn resolution that,
   in whatsoever place their Master, the Son of David, the King, shall be,
   there also will they be as his servants, whether in life or in death.

   Now this resolution, if any here have formed it, and I know many
   have--this resolution that surely in what place the Lord Jesus shall
   be, whether in death or in life, even there will we, his servants, be,
   in the first place, is:--

   I. A GOOD RESOLUTION--one which can be supported by abundant reasons.

   Let me say, in opening out this assertion, that Jesus deserves of all
   who have really tasted of his grace such faithful service, such
   unswerving following in all cases and under all circumstances. Who else
   has ever done for us what Jesus has? Our mother brought us forth, but
   he has given to us a second birth. Our mother candled us upon her knee,
   but he has borne us all the days of old, and even to hoar hairs will he
   carry his people. We have had many kindnesses from friends, but never
   such love as Jesus showed when, we being his enemies, he yet redeemed
   us with his most precious blood. Think of these three words, and try to
   measure what they mean--Gethsemane--Gabbatha--Golgotha. Let those three
   words awaken your adoring memories. Gethsemane--with its garden and
   bloody sweat for you. Gabbatha--with its scourging, its mocking, its
   shame and spitting for you. Golgotha--with its cross and the five
   flowing wounds, and all the bitterness of the divine wrath, and the
   torment of death itself, for you. Men have been known to give away
   their lives cheerfully for some great military leader whose genius has
   commanded their admiration, but they were fools to throw their lives
   away, after all, for these men had done but little or nothing for them
   to make them their servants and slaves. But this Man, my brethren, if
   we had a thousand lives, and were to give them all, yet would deserve
   more of us, for he hath redeemed us from going down into the pit, saved
   us from flames that never shall be quenched, and from a pit that is
   darkness itself. By the eternal woe from which the blood of Christ hath
   uplifted us, let us, who believe that we have been redeemed from hell,
   consecrate ourselves for ever to follow the Lamb whithersoever he
   goeth. His cross is despised; let us be despised with it, for he bore
   shame for us. His truth is counted a lie; let us be willing to be
   regarded as liars, for he had reproach cast on him. Sometimes to defend
   his cause has required the loss of all things; be it ours. if needs be,
   to lose all things for him who gave up all--and what an all that
   was!--the bliss of heaven, and a life itself for us, that he might
   redeem our souls. The deserts of Jesus are such that it would need an
   angel's tongue to tell them out, even though it were but in brief
   catalogue. Look at him in what he is himself as his Father's darling.
   Look at his character; was there ever such another? Survey the beauties
   of his person--were there ever such charms commingled before? Think of
   his life, and of his death, and of what he is doing still before the
   throne, and surely you will feel that it is but right and just that,
   with Jesus, You should enter into the ship and, with him, sail the
   ocean over, be it rough or be it smooth.

   Moreover, brethren, to keep close to Jesus Christ is right. It is in
   itself to keep close to integrity, for the Lord Jesus never stepped out
   of the right path. He never asks any of his followers to do anything
   which be a breach of the right, or which will make them turn aside from
   uprightness. If we could put our feet down exactly where his feet went
   down, even though we had to walk up to Calvary itself, it would be our
   duty so to do, for his path was perfect rectitude, and in him was no
   sin. We challenge heaven, with its omniscience, to detect a flaw in
   him. We challenge hell, with its malice, to discover in him an aught
   that is amiss. Lovers of the right and of the true, ask grace that you
   may be as he was. You cannot be more eminent for virtue than he. You
   cannot serve your God better. You cannot do better than keep close to
   every step that he has taken, and, whether in life or in death, to
   follow him. It is right, then, because he deserves it; it is right,
   again because in itself it is according to the eternal rules of equity.

   And, my brethren, there is another argument why we should cleave to
   Jesus, and it is this--wherefore should we leave him? Can anybody
   suggest a reason why the lover of Christ should turn from him? Polyearp
   was asked that he should curse Christ, and he replied, "Wherefore
   should I curse him? "The, assembly in the amphitheatre could give no
   answer to that; all hell could never give a reply to that. What hath he
   done, what hath he done that we should leave him? What can he have
   done, and what is there that the world can offer that would ever repay
   us for leaving him? Could we so false, so traitorous prove as to turn
   away from Christ, what should we gain? A little pleasure, gone in a
   moment, like thorns that crackle beneath the pot. What should we lose,
   my brethren? We should lose the joy of life; we should lose our support
   in tribulation; we should lose our hope in death; we should lose
   heaven, to inherit nothing but the blackness of darkness for ever. I
   cannot conceive a bribe heavy enough to weigh against him; I cannot
   imagine an honour bright enough to compare with him. I cannot conceive
   a disgrace that can be black enough to compare with the disgrace of
   deserting him. The silver mine of Demas is a poor reward for selling
   his Master. All the wealth of India, could it be poured into one's lap,
   were but a mockery of a soul that damned itself by casting away its
   confidence in Christ. To whom should we go, Master; to whom should we
   go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. To leave Christ would be the
   meanest thing of which any could be capable. I suppose the devil
   himself, with all that ho has ever done, has never been able to compass
   a wickedness that would equal the wickedness, if it were possible, of a
   truly gracious soul deliberately deserting Jesus for the world, for
   such a soul knows the hollowness of this world's joys; such a soul
   knows something of the sweetness of Jesus; such a spirit has been with
   him, and has learned of him, has had the enlightenments of his grace,
   has learned the faithfulness of his promise and the love of his heart.
   Oh! could such a thing be, could the Lord's grace so utterly leave a
   believer that he should turn out an apostate after all, there is need
   to dig another hell, as much lower than hell as hell is lower than the
   earth; there is need to kindle yet more furious flames; seven times
   hotter might the furnace be heated for such an apostate. Glory be to
   God, it shall not be.

   "Grace will complete what grace begins,

   To save from sorrows and from sins

   The work which wisdom undertakes,

   Eternal mercy never forsakes."

   But I speak thus to let you see how reasonable how abundantly necessary
   it is that we should cling close to Christ in life and death, and that
   where he is there we should be. There is no need to reason further, as
   the time is brief, and so let us notice now, in the second place,
   that:--

   II. THIS RESOLUTION, THOUGH GOOD IN ITSELF, SHOULD BE MADE WITH GREAT
   DELIBERATION, SINCE IT WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE TRIED.

   Ah! young brother, you to--day can sing, as others did:--

   "'Tis done, the great transactions done";

   and you sang and felt a joy in singing that last verse:--

   "High heaven that heard the solemn vow,

   That vow renewed shall daily hear

   Till in life's latest hour I bow,

   And bless in death a bond so dear"

   but do you know your weakness? If there were no temptation from
   without, you are fickle enough in yourself. Ah! we might sooner trust
   the wind or rely upon the glassy waves of the ocean than trust our own
   frail resolutions. We are changeable, we are false; our hearts are
   deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. Let him that
   putteth on his harness take care not to boast as him that putteth it
   off. There are dangers ahead and many trials. All is not gold that
   glitters. Firm resolutions are not always kept; yea, let me add they
   are never kept if they are made, in your own strength; they will go
   most surely, and you that promised to stand fast will soon turn aside.

   But, in addition to our own fickleness, we must expect many things to
   try this resolution. There will be, with some of you, the jeers and
   sneers of those you work with. They will call you ill names. Perhaps
   they have began it already. Well, but you do not know what they can
   invent. The Christian soldier has a gauntlet to run. The Christian
   worker in many a large factory has to endure a lifelong martyrdom. Men
   will invent all sorts of gibes and jeers against a believer in Christ,
   and it is fine sport to pelt a Christian. Can ye cleave to your Lord,
   then? Oh! if you cannot, you do not know him, for he is worth ten
   thousand times ten thousand sneers, and you should count it a joy to be
   permitted to bear a scoff for him. Now are you in your measure
   partakers with the noble host of martyrs. You cannot in these softer
   days earn the ruby crown of martyrdom, but you have, at least, the
   trial of cruel mockings. Bear up manfully, and meet their mockery with
   your holy bravery and patient endurance.

   And you will have, probably, a worse trial than that, and that is to
   see those who professed to go with you, as you thought, turn aside. Oh!
   to young Christians, this is very staggering. Those of us who are older
   feel this to be a very peculiar cross in church life, to be associated
   with those who are cold-hearted and dead while they profess to be
   Christians, who, after all, ere long betray their hypocrisy; but to
   young people it seems often almost staggering. If such a man is not a
   good man, who can be? Is there anything at all in religion if such a
   man, after all, should turn out to be a deceiver? Oh! but, dear
   brethren, if you love Christ, you will not turn aside because some of
   his friends have forsaken him, for a true friend sticks closer then.
   Like this good man Ittai, that we are speaking of, you will say, "I
   never thrust myself on David before; I kept in the background, but now
   that this rascally Ahithopel has left him, I will go now and offer him
   my kind and affectionate greetings." It ought always to make you who
   love Christ become bolder when these villains turn aside, for now you
   should say that it behaves every honest man to play the man and come to
   his friend. If these turn tail, then should the true-hearted lead the
   van for Christ and for his truth, and if it should even come to pass
   that a standard-bearer should desert his flag, spring forward, young
   man, and grasp it in the stead of him, but never because of that turn
   aside from your Lord.

   Alas! brethren, you may expect, perhaps, to have sterner trials than
   these. If you resolve to cling to Jesus Christ with constancy, you must
   expect to have many trials. God loves to try his people that he may get
   glory out of their trials, and I am sorry to say I have known some who
   in the depths of poverty, when it has suddenly come upon them like an
   armed man, have felt as if religion itself could not support them, and
   they have actually given up their profession. It is poor Christianity
   that cannot bear the loss of all things. Now you may be poor yet, and
   you may be sore sick, but may you have such faith as that you may be
   able to say, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." It is no
   gold if it will not stand the fire, and it is no grace if it will not
   bear affliction.

   You may expect to have great depression of spirit within. Some of us
   know what this is very, very frequently. There are times when the joy
   of religion is gone, and our soul is in the dark, and yet is feeling
   after God, blessed be his name; but this is the pinch, to believe in an
   angry Christ, to hold to his hand and never let him go, though that
   hand should seem to pull itself away; to lodge with Christ when he
   gives you no supper; to go and sleep in Christ's bed when he has not
   made it, but left it hard for you; to say, "With my desire have I
   desired thee in the night, and with my spirit will I seek thee early."
   May you have faith like that faith, that will not, under any
   difficulties, turn aside from Christ.

   Thus you see, then, that this resolution will be a tried one, and
   between here and heaven God knows what trials will befall us. But
   again:--

   III. THIS RESOLUTION MAY BE CARRIED OUT.

   What I have said might tempt you to declare that you would not try it,
   but it may be carried out. There are thousands, tens of thousands upon
   earth who have been with Jesus wherever he has been throughout the
   whole of their lives, and will be with him in death, and after death;
   and there are millions--there they stand--wearing their white robes and
   waving their palms. Listen; you may almost hear their song. These are
   they that overcame; they endured unto the end; they came through great
   tribulation, and washed their robes in the Lamb's blood, and,
   therefore, are they before the throne of God. What was done, in them
   may be done in you.

   But how was it, then, that they held on and kept close to their Lord?
   Answer--it was not in their own strength; it was the Holy Spirit, who
   day by day preserved them, led them in knowledge and true holiness,
   purged them from sin, and at last made them to enter upon the heritage
   of the perfect. There was not a single moment in which they persevered
   apart from the Spirit's strength. Poor human nature at its best must
   start aside like a broken bow. 'Tis only grace that holds a single
   Christian, and well and truly do we sing in that hymn:--

   "'Tis grace that's kept me till this day,

   And will not let me go."

   Now, subject to the power of the Holy Spirit, the way to accomplish our
   resolve to be with Christ as his servants for ever, is, first of all,
   to be much in prayer. If you cannot persevere with God, you are not
   likely to persevere in contest with man. More prayer, beloved, many of
   you want. As your temptations grow, let your prayers become more
   intense and full of fire, and conquer hell by assaulting heaven. You
   shall prevail against all temptations if you can prevail with God.

   Remember, too, that joined to that prayer there must be much holy fear.
   "Happy is the man," says Solomon, "that feareth always"--not the fear
   that is distrustful and suspicious of God, but the fear that is
   distrustful and more than suspicious of self; the fear that is
   conscious of inward weakness and depravity, that dares not into
   temptation go, but asks to have its eyes turned aside from beholding
   vanity, lest the look should lead to the desire, and the desire should
   engender the act.

   With holy fear there must be much careful walking. He that would
   persevere to heaven must not hope to go there pell-mell helter-skelter,
   heedless, careless, thoughtless as to his daily life. There must be
   self-examination, self-inspection, watchfulness incessantly. An arrow
   may pierce thee between any joint of thy armour unless thou hold the
   shield of faith to catch its barbed shaft, and quench its barbarous
   flame. God grant thee grace to walk carefully and humbly with thy God.

   To persevere in grace we must seek to use all the means of grace that
   can assist us--not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as
   the manner of some is; not neglecting either private or public prayer;
   using what grace we have if we expect to get more; doing what we can
   for God, as we expect him to do all for us; in fine, working out our
   own salvation with fear and trembling, because it is God that worketh
   in us to will and to do of his own good pleasure. If these things be in
   you and abound, they shall be the means of preserving you, and you
   shall be among. the happy number that shall sing, " Now unto him that
   is able to keep us from falling, and to present us faultless before his
   presence with exceeding joys unto him be glory for ever and ever.
   Amen." And now, fourthly and lastly:--

   IV. THIS RESOLUTION MAY BE ACCOMPLISHED IN AN EMPHATIC SENSE.

   Understand me, for here it is that I wish to appeal to believers in
   Christ. This man Ittai said, " Surely in what place that my lord the
   king shall be, whether in death or in life, even there also will thy
   servant be." You can follow Christ in a general way in the. activities
   of Christian life, and so on, but there is a peculiar way of following
   him. You can get, by God's grace, very near your Master, and by still
   greater grace you can keep near to him, and keep near to him all your
   lives. I have never been able to hope for perfection in the flesh, but
   I believe that even Christian ought to strain after even perfection
   itself. I am afraid we have fixed. the standard of what a Christian may
   be a deal too low; of what a. Christian should be it would not be
   possible to fix the standard too high. It is not needful for a
   Christian to be sometimes with Christ, and sometimes to lose
   fellowship. It is not necessary for a Christian to be full of doubts
   and fears. I met an elderly Christian some years ago who is now in
   heaven, whose word certainly I could never dare to have doubted, who
   told me that by the space of forty years he had never had a doubt of
   his own acceptance in the Beloved, and though he had had many troubles
   and trials, he did not know that his communion with Christ had once
   been interrupted. I marvelled at him, but I marvelled a great deal more
   at myself that I had not tried to get into the same place. Why not? If
   you are straitened, it certainly is not in your God; you are straitened
   in your own bowels. He never gave you legitimate cause to doubt him,
   nor did he ever give you a reasonable excuse for forsaking fellowship
   with him. Let us, oh! let us aim at keeping as near to Jesus as John
   did, and not, like Peter, follow afar off. Let it be the great prayer
   of our lives:

   "Abide with me from morn till eve,

   For without thee I cannot live."

   Let us ask that our communion may be kept up in business hours as well
   as in the private closet, that we may walk with Christ on tile Exchange
   and in the street, as well as in the Tabernacle, or in the public
   engagements of worship. Why need we leave him, Certainly he will not
   leave us. Oh! that we may cling to him closely, cling to him and hold
   him fast. I like the saying of a dying negro boy, who was asked why he
   felt so happy in the thought of going to heaven. and he said, "I want
   to go to heaven principally because Jesus is there." "Well," said they,
   "but do you always want to be with Jesus, then, and with nobody else?"
   "Yes," said he, "I only care to be where Jesus is. "But suppose Jesus
   were to leave heaven?" Said he, "I would go with him." "But suppose
   Jesus went to hell, what then?" "Ah!" said the boy, "but there could
   not be any hell where Jesus was; I would go with Jesus wherever he
   might go." Oh! that we had that kind of spirit, and that desire ever
   more, not to be self-seeking, nor world-seeking, nor getting our joy
   out of common pleasures, nor hunting after comfort where it cannot be
   found in these low-land joys; but let us seek to be on the wing with
   our Master, up aloft, dwelling in the land of communion. where Jesus
   lets out his very heart to his people, and reveals himself to them as
   he cloth not unto the world. The Lord give to this church many of those
   favoured men and women, whose communion shall be with the Father, and
   with his Son, Jesus Christ. Oh! it is the happiest, holiest, safest,
   richest. most useful kind of life. God grant it to you.

   But oh! dear friends, there are some here to whom all this talk is
   nothing for they have never taken up the cross of King Jesus at all. Do
   you know it is very seldom I come into this pulpit, very seldom indeed,
   without my seeing here and there that mournful colour which indicates
   that another person has departed this life? We are so numerous that
   there are two or three deaths every week, and sometimes five or six,
   and as I happen to know when each one is taken away I am continually
   reminded of the mortality of my congregation--never twice alike--never
   under any circumstances--always some here that will never be here again
   or were not here before; always some here who are just on the brink of
   the grave. Now I speak to you to-night who may, though you know it not,
   be on the brink of the grave, and I shall ask you to put to yourselves
   this question, How will it fare with you when you pass into the
   spirit-world, and stand before your God, when you are not reckoned as a
   friend of Christ, but have to take your stand among his enemies? You
   would not wish to take that place even to-night. You are halting
   between two opinions; but, my dear friend, that halting of yours must
   come to an end very soon, or otherwise death will decide it, and where
   death finds you judgment will leave you, and hell will continue you.
   Oh! I pray you lay hold on eternal life, and this night cast in your
   lot with Christ. Oh! he is the brightest leader ever soldier had. He is
   the fairest Prince under whom anyone could serve. His cause is such as
   will ennoble you. To fight under his banner makes each private soldier
   into a prince, ennobles each one into a king. Before thou canst serve
   him, remember thou must be washed by him. There is a fountain filled
   with blood; if thou cost trust him, that blood will make thee white as
   snow. If thou cost trust him now, his Holy Spirit will give thee grace
   to enlist in his army, and to continue a faithful soldier until thou
   shalt lay down thy battle with thy life, and cease at once to fight and
   live, and enter into the victory for ever and ever. By the horror of
   Christ's defeated foes. among whom I would not have you numbered; by
   the glory of Christ's victorious friends, among whom I would fain see
   you muster, look unto Christ and live to-night, and may he help you to
   do so. Amen.

                               A Miracle of Grace

   A Sermon

   (No. 3505)

   Published on Thursday, March 30th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [13]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to
   do worse than the heathen, whom the Lord had destroyed before the
   children of Israel. And the Lord spake to Manasseh and to his people;
   but they would not hearken. Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the
   captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among
   the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. And
   when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord, his God, and humbled
   himself greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed unto him and
   he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him
   again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord
   he was God."--2 Chron. 33:9-13.

   MANASSEH was born three years after his father's memorable sickness.
   You will remember that Hezekiah was stricken with a mortal disease, and
   Isaiah, the prophet, come to him and said, "Thus saith the Lord, Set
   thine house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live." He appears to
   have been startled and appalled at the tidings, and gave vent to his
   feelings with bitter tears. Evidently he was afraid at the time to face
   death. He had probably been indulging a worldly spirit; and besides
   this, it lay as a heavy burden upon his heart that he had no son whom
   he should leave as his successor in the kingdom. In deep distress of
   soul, accordingly, he turned to the wall and prayed to the Lord. With
   piteous weeping and earnest pleading he besought that his life might be
   spared. His prayer was heard, his tears were seen, and his petition was
   granted by God. His days were prolonged by fifteen years. In the third
   year of those fifteen years his son Manasseh was born to hire. Had he
   knows, methinks, what sort of a son would have risen up in his stead,
   he might have been content to die, rather than to be the father of such
   a persecutor of God's people, and such a setter up of idolatry in the
   land. Alas! full often we know not what we, pray for. We may be
   covetous of an apparent boon which would prove to be a real curse both
   to ourselves and to thousands of others. You prayed, mother--yea,
   prayed fervently--for the life of that dear babe whom God was pleaded
   to take away from you. You cannot know what disposition the child would
   have shown, what temptations would have befallen it, or what
   consequences would have come of its life. Could some parents have read
   the history of their children from the day of their birth, they might
   rightly have wished that they had never been born. We had better leave
   such matters with God, and submit to his sovereign will. He knows
   better than we do, for ho is wonderful in counsel and excellent in
   working. Thank God, these affairs are not in our own hands. They are in
   far better and wiser keeping than ours.

   Manasseh's mother was named Hephzi-bah, a beautiful name. I wonder
   whether Hezekiah gave her the name because she was his delight, or
   because his gratitude inspired it, as he was then himself delighting in
   his God. I can scarcely think that at such a time he would have chosen
   one who had not also chosen God; therefore, let us think of her as a
   godly woman. But in that case she could have had little enough delight
   in her son; and sometimes, I should think, when she saw him pursuing
   the people of God with the sword, and sinning with a high hand, she
   must have been ready to say, "Call me no more Hephzi-bah, but call me
   Marah, for the Lord hath dealt bitterly with me." It is not always that
   the thing which makes us glad to-day will make us glad to-morrow
   likewise. Let children be accounted a heritage of the Lord. They are
   the joy of our hearts and the flowers of our homes. But what will they
   be to us when the gay, guileless, sportive days of their childhood have
   run out? Unless God sends his blessing with them, the increase of our
   families may be the sorrow of our lives. Evil passions and propensities
   develop themselves in our children with their growth, and if the grace
   of God does not subdue their sinful disposition, we may have to rue the
   day that they were born. Manasseh's name signified "forgetfulness." I
   hope his father did not forget his training, and leave him to those
   young courtiers who always hang about kings' palaces, and are pretty
   sure to instil into a young prince's mind more vanity than virtue, and
   bespeak his favour and patronage for the popular party. There was a
   superstitious section in those days, cultivating idolatry and pouring
   contempt on the Evangelical brethren, whose cause his father, Hezekiah,
   had espoused so earnestly and defended all his days. That new religion,
   imported from among the heathen, had its meretricious attractions. Was
   there not a great deal to please the eye in its pageant, and much to
   charm the ear in its worship? The beautiful artistic work in the
   statuary of its idols, and the fine display of pomp in all the
   ceremonies--did not these appeal to a cultivated taste? The
   old-fashioned puritanical order of worshipping at one temple, where the
   service was bald, and where there was scarcely anything to be seen
   except by the priests themselves, was becoming effete. Would it not be
   better to go with the times, take up with Baalim and Ashtaroth, do
   homage to the sensuous proclivities of the common people, and make
   friendly alliances with nations holding other creeds? I should not
   wonder but they talked to the young man in that fashion, and
   he--oblivious of what God bad done for his sire and forgetful that in
   the long history of the house of Judah the people had always been
   smitten when they turned aside to idols and that they only prospered
   when they clave to the living God fell into the snare, and sinned with
   a high hand.

   I shall introduce him to you first as a loathsome monster of guilt;
   then, secondly, I shall show you how the hand of God followed him till
   he became a piteous spectacle of misery; after which--blessed be
   God!--we shall have to mount into a clearer atmosphere, when we point
   him out to you as he became afterwards, a miracle of grace; and in fine
   we shall have to admire him as a delightful picture of genuine
   repentance. We must begin by considering him as:

   I. A LOATHSOME MONSTER OF GUILT.

   I cannot imagine that any one of my hearers can have been so great a
   sinner as Manasseh. I shall not attempt to draw a parallel between him
   and anyone else. Still, I should not wonder if some of you may be led
   to draw some such parallel for yourselves. If you do so, I pray the
   Lord to give you such a sense of your own guilt as shall constrain you
   to seek pardon.

   Deep was the crime, and daring was the impiety of Manasseh, in size
   that he undid all the good work of his pious father. What Hezekiah had
   painfully wrought at the web he began to unravel as fast as he could.
   That which the father built up for God the son pulled. down; and that
   which the father had cast down because it was evil the son at once
   began to reconstruct. I must confess I have known sons do the like.
   Because, they have hated their father's piety, as it has been a
   restraint upon their sin, they have vowed that if it ever came into
   their power to do as they liked, there should be a change in the
   household. As I passed a certain house this week a friend said to me,
   "Many a prayer-meeting has been held in that farmhouse. People used to
   come for miles round there to meet and pray." "Is that a thing of the
   past?" said I; "are no prayer meetings held there now?" "Oh! no," he
   replied; "the father died, and his reprobate son came into the
   property. A prayer meeting, indeed! No. He defied his mother to attempt
   such a thing; and after having stripped her, and stripped the little
   estate of all there was that was worth the having, he has gone away,
   and has not been heard of for many a year. As far as he could, he tore
   down everything that belonged to his father that reminded him of his
   God." Mr. Whitefield used to tell of a wicked son who said be would not
   live in the same house that his father had inhabited, for he said that
   every room in the house stunk of his father's religion, and he could
   not bear it. There are men who after such manner devise mischief. But
   ah! young man, you cannot sin in that atrocious way without incurring
   extraordinary guilt. It will be remembered that you sin against the
   light; it will be recollected at the last great day that you were
   prayed for--that you were instructed in the right way; nor will you sin
   so cheap as others--others, did I say? I means such as, when they
   transgress, only follow an evil example, and run in the path which
   their parents taught them. Oh! how I grieve over ungodly young men who
   treat their father's God with dishonour and despite.

   Manasseh's sin was aggravated by the fact that he chose to follow the
   very worst examples. Though he had in his father one of the best
   patterns of purity, that would not do, but he must cast about him to
   see whom he could imitate. Upon whom think ye, did he light? Why, upon
   Ahab--the Ahab Of whom God had said that he would cut off every one of
   his house, and not leave one remaining; a threat which had been
   executed, for the blood of Ahab had been licked by dogs in the field of
   Naboth, and Jezebel, his wife, had been devoured of dogs. Yet this
   young man must needs choose Ahab to be his pattern, so he set up
   Baalim, even as Ahab had done of old. The like folly I have known to be
   committed by young men in these days. It may be there are those here
   who have not found anybody that they could imitate, until at last they
   sought out some licentious individual, perhaps, of years gone by, whom
   they have elected to be their leader. Why, half the youth of England
   used, at one time, to be infatuated with Lord Byron. The glare of his
   genius blinded them as to the terrible hue of his character and the
   atrocity of his conduct, so they followed headlong in his track,
   because, forsooth, he was a great man and a poet. Affecting wit, they
   bid defiance to pure morals. Alas! for the men whose sentiments, whose
   language, and whose actions betray the hardihood and the daring of
   vicious characters they are prone to emulate! Though they know better,
   they deliberately choose the worst models that they can copy from. What
   extravagance man will perpetrate in sin!

   But this Manasseh sought out for himself unusual and outlandish sins.
   Bad as Ahab was, he had not worshipped the host of heaven. That was an
   Assyrian worship, and this man must needs import from Assyria and
   Babylonia worship that was quite new. He set up the image Ashra, which
   you may, perhaps, have seen on the slabs that have been brought from
   Nineveh: a tree bearing souls, intended to represent all the host of
   heaven. He carved this in the house of God, and set it up for worship.
   We read in the prophets that the people used to stand in front of the
   temple and bow before the rising sun, worshipping the hosts of heaven.
   He was not satisfied with common sin. We have known sinners of this
   class; they are not content merely to sin as others do; they are
   ambitious to invent some fresh sin. Like Tiberius, who offered a prize
   if somebody would find him out a new pleasure, they want to discover a
   new species of impiety, which shall draw attention to themselves. They
   must be singular in whatever they attempt; even if it comes to being
   singularly wicked. Such was Manasseh. He could not be satisfied to run
   in the race with others, and mingle with the ill-fashion of his times;
   swiftly as they would fly, he must distance them all.

   Beyond this, he insulted God to his face. Here, perhaps, his sin
   culminates. It was not enough to build idol temples for idol worship,
   but he must needs set up the idols and their altars in the Temple of
   Jehovah. Such arrogance, as we think of it, makes our blood chill. And
   ah! one trembles to tell it, not a few men have thus invoked upon their
   bodies and their souls the curse of the Almighty. So desperately have
   they been set on transgression, that they have lifted their hand and
   defied their Maker. Had he not been God--the God of all patience--he
   would have resented their defiance, and have suddenly smitten them down
   to hell; but being God, and not man, he has borne with them. He is too
   great to be stirred by their insults. He has put it by, and let it lie
   still, winking alike at their ignorance and their assumption. for a
   while, until their iniquity shall be full; and then, in his justice,
   will he visit it upon their head. There are not a few in our great city
   who continually do all that they can to provoke God, and to show how
   little they reverence him how utterly they ignore his claims on their
   homage. They will go out of their way to introduce blasphemies into
   their common conversation, and to express their disgust and contempt
   for everything chaste and comely, sacred and godly. Such was Manasseh.
   He set up the altars of the false gods in the house of the living God.

   Is not his character black enough? Nay, we have not laid on the
   thickest touches yet. We are told he made his children to pass through
   the fire; that is to say, he passed them between the red-hot arms of
   Moloch, that they might belong for ever as long as they lived, to that
   fiendish deity. If we do not aver that men do this now-a-days, they
   fall little short of the same cruelty and crime. Many a man teaches his
   child to drink arduous spirits; trains him to habits which he knows
   will lead him to drunkenness; does his utmost to pass the child through
   the red-hot arms of the spirit-fiend, Else Moloch of the present time.
   Many a man has taught his child to blaspheme. If he has not
   deliberately purposed it, he has actually effected it, fully conscious
   that he was so doing. What was his example but a deliberate lesson? Ay;
   there are people who seem to take delight in the sins of their
   children, Laughing at the iniquities they have instructed their own
   sons to perpetrate. Do I address a father who, for many years, has
   never attended a place of worship on the Sabbath--who has often gone
   home reeling drunk, and, though somewhat reformed himself, sees his own
   son plunging into every vice that he was himself once habituated to?
   Let me ask you, Do you wonder at it? Do you wonder at it? You have
   passed your children through the flames; what marvel that they were
   singed, and that the smell of fire is upon them? Oh! it is a crying sin
   that men will not only go to hell themselves, but they must needs drag
   their children with them. Many a man has not been satisfied to be
   ruined but he must ruin same young woman who, perhaps, once had
   religious convictions. He becomes her husband, and forbids her to
   attend the house of God. As for his children, they may, perhaps, be
   sent to the Sunday School to get them out of the way in the afternoon,
   yet any goad they might learn there is Soon dissipated by the scenes
   and sounds they witness and hear under the roof of their home. Why,
   multitudes in this city--we know it, and they must know it
   themselves--are ruining their children, deliberately compassing their
   perdition. Is this a small sin, an insignificant mistake in their
   training? I trow not.

   Moreover, Manasseh proceeded further, for he made a league with devils.
   There were, in his day, certain persons who professed to talk with
   departed spirits, supposing that the devil had the means of
   communicating with them about things to come. Now, whether this
   fellowship with familiar spirits is a delusion and a lie, as I suspect
   it is, or whether there may be a mystery of Satan involved in it, I do
   not know; but certain it was that Manasseh tried to get as near the
   devil as he could. If he could get him to be his friend he was well
   content to make a covenant with hell, so that it might answer his
   purposes. Let him have good luck; little did he care for God. He would
   consult a wizard. Superstition led him to that, but the good Word of
   God he utterly despised. And there are same that have done this--some
   here, perhaps. I will not suppose they have lent themselves to those
   silly superstitions, or resorted lo those deceitful or deceived mediums
   who perform in the dark. I should think, in these modern times of
   popular education, anyone is fit to be confined in a lunatic asylum who
   is beguiled by that snare. Intelligence should protect you from
   imposture. But there be those who, if the devil would help them, would
   be glad enough to shake hands with him, and say, "Hail, fellow; well
   met!" If they do not entertain the devil, it is no fault of theirs.
   They have set the table for him, and furnished the house, and made
   themselves quite ready for any evil spirit that chooses to come to
   them. Oh! what iniquity this is! They will not have God; they will have
   Satan. They cast off the great Father in heaven, but the archenemy of
   souls--with him they make a covenant, and contract a league. Could sin
   go much farther shall this? It could, and it did; for this man led the
   whole nation astray. Being a king, he had great power, and he used his
   authority and exerted his influence to induce his subjects to follow
   his pernicious course. I often wonder what will be the horror of a man
   that has lived in gross sin when, in the next world, he meets those
   that he betrayed and seduced into iniquity, when he begins to see, in
   the murky gloom of that intolerable pit, a pair of eyes which somehow
   or other seem to hold him fixed and fast. He recognises them; he has
   seen them somewhere before, and those eyes flash fire into the soul as
   though they would utterly consume him, and a voice says, "A thousand
   curses on thee! Thou art he that led me first into sin-enticed me from
   a virtuous home, and from godly associations, to become thy partner in
   iniquity. A blast be on thee evermore!" What company they have to keep
   in that place of torment! How they will gnash their teeth at one
   another in dreadful rage, each one charging the other with being his
   destroyer! Oh! there is remorse enough in store for a man who ruins
   himself, but who can tell the pangs that shall scourge his soul who
   betrays his fellow-creatures, and precipitates them into everlasting
   ruin? Verily, dear friends, we stand aghast at the picture of such a
   man as Manasseh, he set no bounds to his sin. He sinned with both hands
   greedily, and when the messengers came from God to tell him of it, he
   was angry with them. Tradition says that he sawed the prophet Isaiah in
   halves for daring to reprove him. But it is not from tradition, but
   from revelation, we learn that he made Jerusalem to swim with blood
   from one end to the other, putting to death all those that would not go
   in his ways and follow his devices. Persecution of the saints of God is
   a scarlet sin, that calls aloud to heaven for vengeance. Manasseh was
   guilty of this, among other crimes. I am sick at heart, and my tongue
   is weary of the story. Let me turn to another branch of the narrative.
   This terrible monster of iniquity presently became:--

   II. A SINGULAR SPECTACLE OF MISERY.

   A few words will suffice to describe it. The Assyrian king sent his
   captain, one Tartan, who besieged the city till it was devastated, and
   the king fled. It would appear that he hid himself in a thorn brake,
   and was dragged out from it, and fettered and manacled with heavy
   irons. There remains a representation at the present time of some
   Jewish king--we cannot be sure it was Manasseh--who was dragged before
   the King of Babylon. At any rate, it represents what was done to
   Manasseh, whether the like treatment befell any other Jewish king or
   not. He has two rings--a ring on each ankle, and a heavy bolt between
   them, and his hands are fastened in the same manner. He is brought
   before the king at Babylon. There he seems to have been cast into
   prison, and kept in confinement. The cruelties of the Assyrian monarchs
   are attested by the memorials upon their own palace walls; therefore, I
   can fully credit the story told; by Jerome, that this Manasseh was
   himself put into a brazen vessel, and subjected to the most intense
   heat, the Assyrian king abusing him for having passed his own child
   through the fire in the same manner. That he was kept for many a long
   month in a dark and dreary dungeon, with only sufficient bread and
   vinegar given him to sustain his life, appears certain. He must have
   been wretched to the last degree: his crown gone, his kingdom
   devastated, his subjects put to unheard--of miseries, We are told that
   the judgment which God executed upon the land was such that it made the
   both ears of him that heard of it to tingle. The king must, therefore,
   have experienced some indescribable afflictions from the hands of the
   tyrant of Assyria. Ah! sinner, though thou harden thyself in thy
   transgressions, thou wilt not go unpunished. A bitter end awaits thee.
   Reckless as thou art, young man, thy father's God will not always be
   mocked. You have persecuted your wife and your friend, but their
   unhappiness will return ere long to your own bosom. There will come an
   end to your arrogance, and a beginning to your recompenses. Oh! I wish
   your iniquity would come to an end soon, and that it might end with
   your conversion. If it does not come to that end, your outlook is
   gloomy indeed, for your total destruction will complete the course you
   are running.

   Perhaps I am addressing somebody who has been living in heartless sin
   until he has become entangled in helpless misery. In this crowd you
   seem as if you were pointed out, for your heart is ready to break with
   anguish. Your property is lost, your health is broken up, your
   character is blasted; you are a mere wreck, a waif, a stray upon the
   dark sea. There is none to have compassion upon you. You are a
   castaway. Even your old companions have forsaken you. The devil himself
   seems to have cast you adrift. You are abandoned, and you might cry out
   and sound your own death knell. "Lost! lost! lost!" Well, now, I have a
   message from God to you. I am come to speak to you, in the name of the
   Lord, about this man Manasseh, in the hope that it may be also
   concerning yourself true--that after having been a prodigy of sin, and
   a spectacle of misery, you may now become as, in the third place,
   Manasseh became:--

   III. A MONUMENT OF GRACE.

   Oh! I do not wonder at Manasseh's sin one half so much as I wonder at
   God's mercy. There was the man in the prison. He had never thought of
   his God except to despise his prerogative, and offend against his laws,
   till he was immured in that dungeon. Then his pride began to break; his
   haughty spirit had to yield at last. "Who is Jehovah, that I should
   serve him?" he had often said. But now he is in Jehovah's hand. Lying
   there half-starved in the prison, a crushed man, he begins to cry,
   "Jehovah, what a fool I have been! I have stood out against thee until
   at length thy sovereign power has arrested me. and thy infinite justice
   has begun to avenge my crimes. What shall I do? Where shall I hide from
   thy wrath? How can I escape? Is it possible to obtain thy pardon?" He
   began to humble himself; God's Spirit came and humbled him more and
   more; he saw how foolish he had been, how wicked his character, how
   cruel his conduct, how abominable. Thus he spent his days and nights,
   in weeping and in lamentation. It was not the prison he cared so much
   about. His soul had gone into iron bondage. Then it suddenly flashed
   across his mind that perhaps God might have mercy on him, so he began
   to pray. Oh! what a trembling prayer that first prayer was. Methinks
   Satan said to him, "It is no use your praying, Manasseh. Why, you have
   defied the living God to his face. He will tell you to go to the idol
   gods you have served, repair to the images you have set up, and bow
   before the hosts of heaven you have been wont to worship, and see what
   they can for you." Nay; but in this awful despair he felt he must pray;
   and surely the first prayer he breathed must have been, "God be
   merciful to me a sinner." And in his deep abasement, he continued still
   to pray and plead with God. And that dear Father of ours who is in
   heaven heard him. If ever you can bring him a praying heart, he will
   bring you a forgiving message. As soon as he saw his poor child broken
   down, and confessing his wrong, he took pity on him, heard, and
   answered him, and blotted out his sins like a cloud, and his
   transgressions like a thick cloud. I think I see Manasseh, with his
   morsel to eat, never enough to stay his hunger, and his little drops of
   vinegar, saying to himself, "Ah! I don't deserve this!" He would thank
   God even for that starving allowance in the depths of his cell, feeling
   that it was mercy that let him live. "Why should a living man complain,
   a man for the punishment of his sins?" And so it came to pass that he
   was delivered.

   The King of Assyria, for State reasons which I need not mention,
   determined to put this king on his throne again. He thought that he had
   broken him down, and humbled him enough; that he would make a good
   viceroy and a faithful lieutenant, and that he would be afraid to rebel
   again, so one bright day he opened wide Manasseh's dungeon, and told
   him he was going to send him back to Jerusalem. And when he told him
   that, then Manasseh knew that Jehovah, he was God. This conclusion was
   forced upon him by the mercy he obtained. "Who," he would say, "but the
   Most High God could have brought me out of this horrible pit, have
   released me from the power of this tyrant king, or moved his heart to
   relent, and have compassion on me?" As he rode back to Jerusalem, how
   his heart would be breaking with gratitude! I think I see him when he
   first got within sight of the walls of that temple which he had so
   recklessly profaned. Surely he threw himself upon his face, and wept
   sore, and then arose and blessed the name of the Lord tl at had
   forgiven all his trespasses. And when he entered Jerusalem, and the
   people gathered round him, what must the greetings have been? Where are
   those courtiers that had been his companions, that led him into sin? Do
   they come whining round him? What a rebuff they will get! How will he
   exclaim, "Get you gone. I am another man. I do not want your company or
   your counsel." Are there any of those poor people standing in the
   background--the people that used to meet to pray and worship Jehovah,
   faithful among the faithless found--such as had been wont to hide away
   their Bibles because they were hunted and harried from one retreat to
   another--a small remnant, that had escaped the fangs of the
   persecutors--did they came forward? How he could look at them, and say,
   "Ah! you servants of Jehovah, you are my brethren. Give me your hands;
   for I, too, have found from heaven, and I am, like you, a child of
   God." I warrant you there was singing in Jerusalem that night amongst
   the feeble band of the steadfast believers; and there must have been
   music in heaven too, for the fiery angels must have rejoiced in a
   conversion that seemed so unlikely, so incredible.

   "What, Manasseh saved? Manasseh--that bloodhound--is he transformed, by
   the renewing of his mind, into a lamb of God's flock? What he, the
   red-handed persecutor--has he become a professor of the faith he once
   destroyed?" Ah! yes. Well might Bishop Hall say, "Who can complain that
   the way of heaven is blocked against him, when he sees such a sinner
   enter? Say the worst against thyself, O clamorous soul! Here is one
   that murdered men, defied God, and worshipped devils, yet he finds the
   way to repentance. If thou be vile as he, know that it is not thy sin,
   but thy impenitence, that bars heaven against thee. Who can now despair
   of thy mercy, O God, that sees the tears of a Manasseh accepted?" I
   remember an old lady who would not travel by railway because she
   thought that some of the bridges were in bad repair, especially the
   Saltash bridge, near her own house. Over that bridge she could not be
   persuaded to pass, for fear her weight should break it down, although
   hundreds of tons weight were carried over it every day. At such folly
   everybody can smile. But when I hear any man say, "I have committed so
   much sin, that God cannot pardon it," I think his folly is far greater.
   Look at this huge train that went over that bridge. Behold Manasseh
   laden with ponderous crimes! Mark what a train of sin there was behind
   him! Then look at the bridge, and see whether it starts by reason of
   the loaded teem of wills which is rolling over it. Ah! no, it bears up,
   and so would it bear the weight if all the, Sins that men have done
   should roll across its arches. Christ is "able to save to the uttermost
   them that come unto God by him." I do not know where to cast my eyes
   for the person to whom this message is directed. That he is somewhere
   in this assembly I entertain no doubt. So I speak to some sister who,
   in an unguarded hour, left the path of virtue, and since then has
   pursued a course of shame? I pray you accept the message. I deliver it
   to you. The greatest sin, the utmost guilt, the most incredible
   iniquity, the most abominable transgressions, can be forgiven, and
   shall be blotted out. The Redeemer lives; the sacrifice has been
   offered; the covenant is sealed. Turn now to the Lord with purpose of
   heart. Confess the sins. Abjure thyself. Trust in the infinite mercy of
   God, through Jesus Christ, his Son. "Let the wicked forsake his way,
   and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn unto the Lord,
   for he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly
   pardon." Our closing reflection is that Manasseh became:--

   IV. A PICTURE OF TRUE REPENTANCE.

   At once he ceased to do evil. He went straightway to the temple and
   pulled down the idols. How I would like to have been with him, and have
   had a hand in demolishing them. Down went the images; then over went
   the altars; every stone was dragged right out of the city, and flung
   away. God grant that every image in England may yet be pulled down,
   battered to pieces, and the small dust thereof flung into the common
   sewers. May that which is an utter abomination before heaven stir a
   righteous indignation on earth. Oh! that our land may be so godly that
   no respect for fine arts may suffer her to tolerate foul impieties!
   Manasseh made haste to undo the mischief he had done. This is what
   every converted man tries to do. All the evil he has ever caused he
   tries to stay; he takes vengeance on his former devices; against them
   he lifts both his hands, raises his voice, and exerts his influence.

   Nor did this suffice; Manasseh began forthwith to do good. Right
   speedily he began to repair the altar of the Lord, and to restore the
   services of God and the ordinances of the Temple to their original
   purity, according to the divine statutes. So when a man is truly
   converted, he will be anxious to join himself to the Lord's people, and
   support the institutions of his house. Nor did Manasseh smother his
   gratitude, but he presented thank-offerings to God. He was not
   unmindful of the devout acknowledgments that were due for the great
   mercy he had received. Like that other great sinner, whose gratitude is
   recorded in the gospel--the woman who brought an alabaster box of
   ointment, very precious, and brake it--like her, methinks, he loved
   much because he had had much forgiven.

   And, then, being established in his kingdom, he proceeded to use his
   high influence for holy purposes. He ruled his subjects in the fear of
   the Lord; and made the law of his God to be the law of the land,
   renouncing all strange gods, and adhering rigidly to the book by
   inspiration given. Oh! that God would incline the heart of some
   penitent sinner here at once to bring forth this fruit of conversion!
   What a change there would be in his house! What a difference his family
   would see! What an altered man he would appear in his daily avocation,
   whether he be employer or employed! He would be seeking the conversion
   of those whom he formerly led astray. Those he once scoffed at, and
   called by evil names, would become his choicest companions. "Can God do
   this?", says one. Oh! my dear hearers, the God that can forgive great
   sin can also change hard hearts. Cry to him. If you are unsaved, may
   his Spirit lead you to seek salvation now. Stay not for to-morrow's
   sun. If you are saved yourself, may that blessed Spirit lead you to
   pray for others, and seek their present and eternal welfare. Watch unto
   prayer. Let your own faith in God stimulate you to believe that all
   things are possible. Never give them up, never give them up. Are you a
   mother--you do not know how prevalent your intercessions may prove. I
   wonder whether poor Hephzi-bah was alive when Manasseh was converted?
   She had grieved over him, doubtless, in his young days. Well, if she
   did not live to see the fruit of her prayers, yet her prayers lived,
   and her tears were repaid with rich interest. There is many a mother's
   son whose heart will be turned to God long after his mother's bones
   have been laid in the churchyard. The vision is for an appointed time;
   though it tarry, wait for it. Thy son will yet be brought to glory
   through thy prayers. Pray on, brethren and sisters, pray on for those
   whose sins and sorrows lay heavily on your heart. Pray on, and God will
   hear you. O poor sinners, the mercy of God is the antidote for man's
   despair. Believe in his mercy. Look for his mercy. Cast yourselves upon
   his mercy, and you shall find his mercy unto everlasting life. God
   grant it for Christ's sake. Amen.

                               What Self Deserves

   A Sermon

   (No. 3506)

   Published on Thursday, April 6th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [14]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, 18th December, 1870.

   "Ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities, and
   for your abominations."--Ezekiel 36:31.

   IT HAS been the supposition of those who know not by experience that if
   a man be persuaded that he is pardoned, and that he is a child of God,
   he will necessarily become proud of the distinction which God has
   conferred upon him. Especially if he be a believer in predestination,
   when he finds that he is one of God's chosen, it is supposed that the
   necessary consequence will be that he will be exceedingly puffed up,
   and think very highly of himself. This however, is but theory; the fact
   lies quite another way; for if a, man be truly subjected to the work of
   grace in the heart, and if he be then brought to trust in Jesus, and to
   see his sin put away by the great sacrifice, instead of being lifted
   up, he will be exceedingly cast down in his own sight, and as he goes
   on to perceive the singular mercy and peculiar privileges which God's
   grace has bestowed upon him, instead of being exalted, he will sink
   lower and lower in his own esteem, until, when he shall make a full
   discovery of divine love, he will become nothing, and Christ will be
   all in all. Mercy never makes us proud. As mercy is given to the
   humble, it has a humbling effect. Wherever it comes, it makes a man lie
   low before the throne of the heavenly grace, and leads him to ascribe
   all honour and glory to the God from whom the mercy comes.

   It appears from our text that when Israel shall be forgiven her long
   years of departure from God, one of the effects of the mercy will be
   that she will loathe herself, and that same effect has already been
   produced in some of us, to whom God's abounding mercy has come. In
   fact, in every man here who has tasted that the Lord is gracious, there
   has been one uniform experience upon this matter--we have been led to
   loathe ourselves in our own sight for all the sin we have done before
   the Lord our God. I shall try to go into this matter, trusting to be
   rightly guided to say fitting and useful words at this time.

   First, my brethren, what is it that we have come to loathe in
   ourselves?; secondly, why do we loathe it?; and thirdly, what is the
   necessary result in us, or should be, of this self-loathing? First,
   then:--

   I. WHAT IS IT THAT THE PARDONED SINNER LOATHES?

   You will perceive that he is a pardoned sinner. The verse is inserted
   here in a position where it plainly belongs to those whom God has
   renewed in heart, whose sins are forgiven, who are fully justified and
   accepted. It is consistent with the full enjoyment of salvation to
   loathe yourself. This is the strange paradox of the Christian faith. He
   who justifies himself is condemned, he who condemns himself is
   justified. He who magnifies himself, God breaks down and casts in
   pieces; he who throws, himself prostrate before the throne of God's
   justice, he it is that God lifteth up in due time. What is it, then,
   that we loathe in ourselves to-day?

   Our reply is, first of all, we loathe every act of our past sin. Look
   back, ye that have been brought to Jesus; look back upon the past. Your
   lives have differed. Some here have, by God's mercy, been kept from
   gross outward sin before their conversion; others have run wantonly
   into it to great excess of riot. Whichever may have been our pathway
   before conversion, we do now unfeignedly loathe all the sin of it,
   whether it were the open sin or the sin of the heart. Especially do we
   loathe to--night those sins which we excused at the time (which we did
   excuse afterwards). because we said, "Others did so," because we could
   not see we did any hurt to our fellow-men thereby. We loathe them
   because, if they did not relate to man, but only to God, it was the
   more vicious of us that we should rebel altogether against him.
   "Against thee thee only, have I sinned," is a part of the bitterness of
   our confession to-night. There were some sins that were sweet to us at
   the time: we rolled them under our tongue, poisonous though they were.
   and we called them sweet morsels. We would revolt against them to-night
   with abhorrence. Begone, ye damnable sins! By your very sweetness to
   me, I detect you. Fool that I must have been that such a thing as thou,
   could have been sweet to me. What eyes must I have had to have seen any
   beauty in thee! How estranged from God to love the things so foul and
   vile! We would recall to-night those greater sins of our life, sins
   perhaps which entangled others. sins which we perpetrated in the face
   of knowledge, after many warnings, desperate. atrocious sins. Oh! what
   mercy that we were not cut down while we were living in them! We turn
   them over and remember them, not, I trust, as some do, I am afraid,
   when they speak of their past lives, as if they were talking about
   their battles and they were old soldiers--never mention your sins
   without tears. Do not write much about them, if at all; it is best to
   do with them as Noah's sons did with their father's nakedness, go back
   and cast a mantle over all. God has forgiven them. Remember them only
   that you may repent, and that you may bless his name, but never mention
   them without loathing them--utterly loathing them as if they were
   disgusting to your spirit, and you could not speak of them without the
   blush mantling on your cheek.

   My brethren, in addition to loathing every act of sin, I think I can
   hope, if our acts are right, we do, through God's mercy, loathe all the
   sins of omission. I will put them in this form. The time we wasted
   before our conversion. Perhaps some of you were not brought to Christ
   until you were thirty, or forty, or fifty years of age. It is a very,
   very happy circumstance to be saved while yet you are younger--a case
   for eternal thankfulness but let us think of the time we wasted,
   precious time, in which we might have served God, time in which we
   might have been learning more of him, studying his Word, and making
   ourselves more fit to he used by him in after years. How much of our
   time ran to waste! I would especially loathe wasted Sabbaths. Some of
   us wasted them at home in idleness; some wasted them abroad in company.
   others of us wasted them in God's house. I would loathe my elf for
   having wasted Sabbaths, under sermons, hearing as though I heard them
   not--joining in devotions in the posture, and not in the heart. And
   what is this but to break the Sabbath under the very garb of keeping
   it--thinking other thoughts and caring for other things while eternal
   matters were being proclaimed in my hearing. Oh! let us loathe
   ourselves to think that even twenty years should have gone to waste,
   much more thirty, or forty, or fifty years even sixty--should have been
   suffered to glide by, bearing nothing upon their bosom but a freight of
   sin, carrying nothing to the throne of God that we would wish to have
   remembered there. Those of us who have been converted to God would this
   night loathe every refusal which we gave to Christ. in those days of
   our unregeneracy. Dost thou remember, my brother in Christ, those early
   knockings at the door of thy heart by a gentle mother's word, or was it
   a father, or was it perhaps a Sunday School teacher, or perhaps some
   dear one now in glory? Oh! that ever I should have refused the Saviour,
   had he but presented himself to me but once! Infatuation not to be
   excused, to close the heart against even one of these! But many times!
   Some of us were very favourably circumstanced. Our mother's tears fell
   thick and fast for us when we were children. She would pray with us;
   when we read the Scriptures with her' she talked to us. Her words were
   very faithful, very tender, and her child could not help feeling them,
   but waywardly he pushed aside the tears, and still forgot his mother's
   God. Then you know with many of us the entreaties of our youth melted
   into the instructions of cur riper years. Do you not remember many
   sermons under which Christ has knocked with his pierced hand at the
   door of your heart? You that sit here from time to time, I know the
   Lord does not leave you without some strivings of heart; at least, I
   hope he does not I do pray the Master to help me to put the word so
   that it may disturb you, and not let you make a nest in your sins, but
   as yet you have said "No" to Christ, and given him the go-by, even
   until now. As for such as are now saved, I am sure they have among
   their most bitter pangs of regret this, that they should ever at any
   time, and that they should so often and so many times have said to the
   Saviour, "Depart from me; I will not know thee, neither do I desire thy
   salvation." And if, my brethren, in addition to having refused Christ,
   we have come into actual collision with him by setting up our own
   Pharisaic estimate of ourselves, we ought to loathe ourselves to-night.
   We did say in our heart, "I am good enough." The filthy rags of our own
   righteousness have had the impertinence to compare with the fair white
   linen of Christ's righteousness. We thought we could put away our own
   sins by some method of our own, and that cross, which s heaven's wonder
   and hell's terror, are despised so as to think we could do without it.
   We might well loathe ourselves for this, if we had never committed any
   other transgression than this. Oh! foul pride, oh! base and loathsome
   pride that can make a sinner think he can do without a Saviour, and so
   presumptuously imagine that Christ was more than was needful, and the
   cross was a work of supererogation.

   Did any of us go further than this? And did we ever commit persecuting
   acts against Christ and his people? Perhaps some of you did, and now
   you are his servants. You laughed at that Christian woman; why, you
   would go down upon your knees now if you could find her, to beg a
   thousand pardons, now you know her to be a child of God. You did then
   act very harshly and severely towards one who was a true lover of the
   Saviour. Perhaps you spoke opprobrious words, or did worse. As Cranmer
   put his hand into the fire and said, "Oh! unworthy right hand," because
   it had written a recantation of Christ and his truth years before. I am
   sure you would say it now if you have written one unkind word, or said
   one ungenerous word concerning a believer in Christ. And oh! if you
   have ever openly blasphemed, I know you loathe yourself, standing here
   to-night, to think those lips once cursed God, and, joining in the
   prayer-meeting with your prayers, to think that those lips once
   imprecated curses upon your fellow-men. I know your feeling must be one
   of very deep prostration of spirit. And even if we have not gone so
   far, we feel, as you do, that we loathe ourselves for our iniquities
   and for our abominations. Thus might I continue to speak to your
   hearts, but I trust, my brethren, it will be needless to do so, for you
   do already loathe yourselves for your sins.

   Let me close this first part of the subject by just remarking that
   there are some persons here who, if the Lord should ever convert them,
   would ever have a strong loathing for themselves. I mean, first,
   hypocrites. There are such in this church, there never was a church
   without them. They come to the communion table, and yet have no part
   nor lot in the matter. We know of some that have been here Sabbath
   after Sabbath, and they are habitual drunkards, undiscovered by us--who
   intrude themselves into the assemblies of the faithful, and yet at the
   same time make much mock and sport of our holy religion. Oh! if you are
   ever saved, what heart-breakings you will have! How you will hate
   yourselves! I shall not say one hard word about you, but I do pray
   God's grace will make you feel a great many hard things about yourself,
   and while you look up into the dear face of the crucified, and find
   pardon there, may you afterwards cover your face with shame, and weep
   to think of the mercy you have found. So, too, those who once professed
   Christ and have gone away altogether--they may be here. I should not
   wonder but what in this throne there are some that used to be religious
   people--put on an appearance and did run well. Now for years they have
   neglected prayer. That woman, once a church member, married an ungodly
   husband, and many a bitter day she has had since then, and to-night she
   has strayed in here. Ah! woman, may God bring thee back and thou wilt
   loathe thyself for having given up Christ for the love of a poor dying
   man. And others that have gone into the world for Sunday trading, or
   for some sort of gain, given up Christ, like Judas, who betrayed him
   for thirty pieces of silver. Oh! if you are ever saved, you will hate
   yourselves. I am sure this will be your cry within yourself, "Saviour,
   thou hast forgiven me, but I shall never forgive myself; thou hast
   blotted out my sins like a cloud, but I shall always remember them, and
   lay very low at thy feet all my praises while I think of what thou hast
   done for me." Yes, and you there have a dear one that is a persecutor,
   a blasphemer, an opposer of the gospel, an infidel; may you become one
   of those who shall abundantly loathe yourself when you shall taste of
   the rich, free mercy of God. Thus I have set forth what it is that a
   man loathes; but let me remark it is not merely his actions he loathes,
   but himself, to think that he could do such things. He loathes the
   fountain to think that it could yield such a stream; he loathes his own
   evil nature, the deep corruption and depravity of his heart, to think
   he should be so ungrateful and treat the Lord of mercy in so ungenerous
   a way. But now we must turn to the second part of the subject.

   II. HOW IS IT, AND WHY, THAT PARDONED SOULS DO LOATHE THEMSELVES?

   Reply first. Their nature is changed. God, in conversion, makes us new
   men. We are not altered, improved, or mended, but a new life is given
   us; we become new creations in Christ Jesus. It is the work of the Holy
   Spirit to make us to be born again, and as that which is born of the
   flesh is flesh, so that which is born of the Spirit is spirit, and it
   hates the old corrupt nature, loathes it, and fights against it to the
   death. And further, the moving cause for loathing ourselves is the
   receipt of divine mercy. "Oh!" saith the soul when it finds itself
   forgiven, "did I rebel against such a God as this! What! has he struck
   out all my sins from the roll, cast them all behind his back, and does
   he declare that he loves me still? Then wretch that I am that I should
   have revolted and rebelled against such a God as this." It is just as
   John Bunyan puts it. There is a city besieged, and they determine that
   they will fight it out to the last. They will make every street to run
   with blood but what they will hold it out against the king who claims
   the city for himself; but when his troops march up and set their ranks
   around the city, and it is all surrounded, the trumpet sounds for a
   parley, and the messenger comes forward with the white flag, and they
   find to their surprise that the conditions offered are so honourable,
   so generous, so much to their own advantage, that the king appears not
   to be their enemy at all, but, in fact, to be their best friend. He
   will enlarge their liberties far above what they were. He will beautify
   their city--it was mean before. He will come and dwell in it; he will
   make it the metropolis of the country; he will give it markets; he will
   give it all it wanted. "Why," saith John Bunyan, "whereas before they
   were going to fortify the walls and die to a man, they fling open the
   gates, and they are ready to tumble over the walls to him, they are so
   glad to find that he treats them so generously." And it is, even so
   with us when we find that he blots out our sin, that he is all love and
   all compassion, we yield to him at once, and then shame comes, to think
   that it should ever have been needful for us to yield, that we should
   ever have taken up arms against him at all. It is a beautiful incident
   in English history when one of our kings was carrying on war against
   his rebellious son. and they met in battle, and the son was, just about
   to kill the father, when the father's visor was lifted up and he saw
   that it was his father whom he was about to kill. So the sinner,
   fighting against his God, thinks he is his enemy, but on a sudden he
   beholds it is his own Father that he has been fighting against, and he
   drops the weapon of his rebellion, feeling ashamed that he should have
   rebelled against such mercy and such favour. That is why we are
   ashamed, and I do pray that some here may be ashamed in the same way,
   for I think I hear Jehovah bewailing himself to-night. "Hear, O
   heavens, and give ear, O earth; I have nourished and brought up
   children, and they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner
   and the ass his master's crib, but Israel doth not know, my people doth
   not consider." Your God is good, be ready to repent and be forgiven;
   rebel no more.

   Now after the receipt of divine mercy has brought in this feeling, the
   feeling is continued and promoted by everything that happens to us. For
   instance, every doctrine a Christian man learns after he is converted
   makes him loathe himself. Suppose he learns the doctrine of election.
   "What!" saith he, "was I chosen of God from before the foundation of
   the world, and did go after filthiness and uncleanness with this body?
   Was I dishonest and a liar, and yet loved of God before the stars began
   to shine?" That doctrine makes a man loathe himself. Then he learns the
   doctrine of redemption, and he reads, "These are they that are redeemed
   from among men"--a special and particular redemption. Did Jesus then
   die for me, as he did not die for all? Had he a special eye to me in
   that sacrifice of himself upon the cross? Oh! then I will smite my
   breast to think there ever should have been such a hard heart towards a
   Saviour who loved me so. There is no doctrine but what, when the heart
   learns it, the spirit bows down with deep shame to think it ever should
   have rebelled. So it is with every fresh mercy the Christian enjoys.
   Surely he wakes up every morning with a fresh mercy, but especially at
   peculiar times when our prayers have been heard, when we have been
   rescued out of deep distress, we lift up our eyes to heaven, and an we
   bless God for all his favours to us we say, "And can it be that I was
   once a rebel, in arms against such a God as thee? My God, my Father,
   did I ever blaspheme thy name? Did I ever read thy Book as a common
   book? Did I ever neglect thy mercy, Saviour? Then shame on me when thou
   hast ever been so good, so kind to me." And as the Christian grows in
   grace and mounts to more elevated platforms of experience, this
   self-loathing gets deeper when the spirit bears witness with him that
   he is a child of God. When he rises as a child to feel that he is an
   heir, and that, being an heir, he claims his heritage to sit with
   Christ in the heavenly places, the more he sees of God's marvellous
   kindness to him, the more he looks back to his past life and to the
   depravity of the heart within, and he says, "Shame on thy head; cover
   thy face with confusion; silence me before thee, oh! thou Most High, to
   think that after such mercy as this I should have remained so
   ungrateful to thee." And I suppose that as long as the Christian lives,
   and the further he goes in the grace of God, the deeper he goes in a
   disestimate of himself; it will ever be so until, as he gets to the
   gates of heaven, among all his joys and the growing sense of divine
   favour, there will be a still deeper sense of repentance for all the
   transgressions of his heart.

   And now I shall need your attention still a few moments longer while I
   dwell upon the third and last point. When a soul is thus made to loathe
   itself:--

   III. WHAT FOLLOWS?

   Well, there follows, first of all, self-distrust. A man who remembers
   what he has been, and has a due sense of what his sin was, will never
   trust himself again. He thought at one time that he could resist sin;
   he imagined that it would be possible for him to fight against
   iniquity, and by daily perseverance to make something of himself. Now
   he has fallen so often, he has proved his own weakness so thoroughly,
   that all he can do now is just to look up to God, and ask for strength
   from on high. He cannot by any possibility rest in himself; his own
   weakness is so thoroughly proved. A man who knows what he used to be is
   conscious of what his former estate was, and will by no sort of means
   rely upon his own strength for a single hour. "Lead us not into
   temptation "will be his constant prayer, and "Deliver us from evil"
   will follow close upon it. When I see a man going into sinful company,
   a Christian professor going on to the verge of sin and saying, "I shall
   not fall, I can take care of myself," I feel pretty certain that that
   man's experience is a very flimsy one, and that it is altogether a very
   grave question whether he ever was pardoned and has tasted of divine
   grace; for if he had, he would have known what it was to loathe himself
   a great deal more, and to distrust himself more.

   The next result in a man will be that he will not serve himself any
   longer. Before, he could have lived for his own honour, but now he has
   such a disestimate of himself that he must have a different object.
   Spend my life for my own honour and glory? "No," saith he, "I am not
   worthy of it. I, who could blaspheme heaven, or could live so long an
   enemy to God--I serve such a monster as myself! No! By God's grace,, I
   will serve him who has changed my nature, forgiven my sin, and made me
   to be a new creature in Christ Jesus. Self-loathing is quite sure to
   make a man have a better object than that of seeking to honour myself."

   And then a man who has once loathed himself will never loathe his
   fellow-men. He will be free from that pride which is found in many,
   which disqualifies them for Christian service, because they do not know
   the hearts of sinners, and do not enter into communion with them. I
   have known some who fancy there ought to be a great distance between
   themselves and what they call common people; who talk of sin as though
   it were a strange thing, in which they had no participation, they
   themselves having been highly elevated above ordinary folks. Oh! we
   know of some that would scorn the harlot, and look down upon a man
   whose character has been once destroyed, and think he never ought to be
   spoken to again. The Christian loathes himself for not having had pity
   on others. He knows how readily his feet might have gone in the same
   way; how easily, too, he might have fallen. even to the same extent, if
   circumstances had been the same with him as with them, and, as far as
   he can, he seeks to uplift them. The man who is once as he should be,
   thrusts his arm to the elbow in every mire to bring up one of God's
   precious jewels. He has put off the kid gloves of self-sufficiency, so
   he works like a true labourer. He knows what Christ has done for
   him--how Jesus poured out his very heart's blood for his
   redemption--and he feels he cannot do too much, if by any means he can
   pluck a single firebrand from the flame. Brethren, it is good to loathe
   ourselves. for it makes us have sympathy with others.

   Yet, once again, this self-loathing in every case where it comes makes
   Jesus Christ very precious, and makes sin very hateful. Whoever bath
   loathed himself at all sees how Jesus Christ has been a great Saviour,
   and he admires and adores him. You know you measure the height of the
   Saviour's love by the depth of your own fall. If you don't know
   anything about your ruin, you won't be likely to prize much the remedy.
   A man that has got a desperate disease, and is dealt with by the
   physician, if he does not know what the disease is, is not able to feel
   the measure of gratitude, even if he is healed, that another man would,
   who knew how fatal the disease was in itself. If I think I am not poor,
   if I be befriended, I shall not have that gratitude which a bankrupt
   would have had if he had nothing left, to whom someone had generously
   given a large estate. No! a sense of need helps us to glorify God.
   Amongst the saints, and when on earth, the sweetest voices are those
   that have been made sweet by repentance. Amongst those that sing in
   heaven, and sing with the most sweet and lofty praise to God, are those
   who bless the grace that lifted them up from the horrible pit and out
   of the miry clay, and set their feet on a rock and established their
   goings. This blessed shamefacedness, which Christ gives us, is not to
   be avoided; may we have it more and more, and it shall be a fit
   preparation for the service of God on earth and the enjoyment of his
   presence in heaven.

   And now, dear friends, it will be a very suitable season for every
   Christian just to look back and let his shame for many things mantle on
   his cheeks. Oh! how little progress have we made in the divine life
   through all the years! We call each year a "year of grace," but we
   might call it a year of sorrow. "The year of our Lord," we call it! Too
   often we make it the Year of ourselves. God save us for not living to
   him, working more for him, and growing more like him! Let us close
   every year with repentance, not because the sin abides, for, blessed be
   God, it is all forgiven--we are saved. Before the sin was perpetrated,
   Christ carried it into the sepulchre where he was buried; he, cast it
   there; it cannot be laid against us to condemn us, yet do we hate it,
   and yet do we loathe ourselves to think we have fallen into it. But
   would not this also be an admirable opportunity to show how we hate sin
   by seeking to bring others to Christ? Do watch for other souls. As you
   prize your own, seek the conversion of others, and God grant that you
   may bring many to Jesus.

   And you that are not saved, oh! suffer not this occasion to pass, let
   not the days go by without your seeking for that mercy which God so
   fully gives through his only-begotten Son. Then when you receive it you
   will be ashamed, and you, too, will magnify the grace that pardoned
   even you. God bless you, dear friends, very richly, for Jesus' sake.
   Amen.

                           Our Lord's Solemn Enquiry

   A Sermon

   (No. 3507)

   Published on Thursday, April 13th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [15]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, April 7th, 1872.

   "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is to say, My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me?"--Matthew 27:46.

   IF any one of us, lovers of the Lord Jesus Christ had been anywhere
   near the cross when he uttered those words, I am sure our hearts would
   have burst with anguish, and one thing is certain--we should have heard
   the tones of that dying cry as long as ever we lived. There is no doubt
   that at certain times they would come to us again, ringing shrill and
   clear through the thick darkness. We should remember just how they were
   uttered, and the emphasis where it was placed, and I have no doubt we
   should turn that text over, and over, and over in our minds. But there
   is one thing, I think, we should never have done if we had heard
   it--therefore, I am not going to do it--we should never preach from it.
   It would have been too painful a recollection for us ever to have used
   it as a text. No; we should have said, "It is enough to hear it." Fully
   understand it, who can? And to expound it, since some measure of
   understanding might be necessary to the exposition--that surely were a
   futile attempt. We should have laid that by; we should have put those
   words away as too sacred, too solemn, except for silent reflection and
   quiet, reverent adoration. I felt when I read these words again, as I
   have often read them, that they seemed to say to me, "You cannot preach
   from us," and, on the other hand, felt as Moses did when he put off his
   shoe from off his foot in the presence of the burning bush, because the
   place whereon he stood was holy ground. Beloved, there is another
   reason why we should not venture to preach from this text, namely, that
   it is probably an expression out of the lowest depths of our Saviour's
   sufferings. With him into the seas of grief we can descend some part of
   the way; but when he comes where all God's waves and billows go over
   him, we cannot go there. We may, indeed, drink of his cup, and be
   baptized with his baptism, but never to the full extent; and,
   therefore, where our fellowship with Christ cannot conduct us to the
   full, though it may in a measure--we shall not venture; not beyond
   where our fellowship with him would lead us aright, lest we blunder by
   speculation, and "darken counsel by words without knowledge." Moreover,
   it comes forcibly upon my mind that though every word here is emphatic,
   we should be pretty sure to put the emphasis somewhere or other too
   little. I do not suppose we should be likely to put it anywhere too
   much. It has been well said that every word in this memorable cry
   deserves to have an emphasis laid upon it. If you read it, "My God, my
   God, why hast thou forsaken me? I marvel not that my disciples should,
   but why hast thou gone, my Father, God? Why couldst thou leave me?"
   there is a wondrous meaning there. Then take it thus, "My God, my God,
   why hast thou forsaken me? I know why thou hast smitten me; I can
   understand why thou dost chasten me; but why hast thou forsaken me?
   Wilt thou allow me no ray of love from the brightness of thine eyes--no
   sense of thy presence whatsoever?" This was the wormwood and the gall
   of all the Saviour's bitter cup. Then God forsook him in his direst
   need. Or if you take it thus, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
   me?" there comes another meaning. "Me, thy well beloved, thine eternal
   well beloved, shine innocent, thy harmless, thine afflicted Son--why
   hast thou forsaken me? "Then, indeed, it is a marvel of marvels not
   that God should forsake his saints, or appear to do so, or that he
   should forsake sinners utterly, but that he should forsake his only
   Son. Then, again, we might with great propriety throw the whole force
   of the verse upon the particle of interrogation, "Why." "My God, my
   God, why, ah! why hast thou forsaken me? What is thy reason? What thy
   motive? What compels thee to this, thou Lord of love? The sun is
   eclipsed, but why is the Son of thy love eclipsed? Thou hast taken away
   the lives of men for sin, but why takest thou away thy love, which is
   my life, from me who hath no sin? Why and wherefore actest thou thus?"

   Now, as I have said, every word requires more emphasis than I can throw
   into it, and some part of the text would be quite sure to be left and
   not dealt with as it should be; therefore, we will not think of
   preaching upon it, but instead thereof we will sit down and commune
   with it.

   You must know that the words of our text are not only the language of
   Christ, but they are the language of David. You who are acquainted with
   the Psalms know that the 22nd Psalm begins with just these words, so
   that David said what Jesus said; and I gather from this that many a
   child of God has had to say precisely what the Lord Jesus, the
   first-born of the family, uttered upon the cross. Now as God's children
   are brought into the same circumstances as Christ, and Christ is
   considered the exemplar, my object to-night will be simply this--not to
   expound the words, but to say to believers who come into a similar
   plight, Do as Jesus did. If you come into his condition, lift up your
   hearts to God, that you may act as he did in that condition. So we
   shall make the Saviour now not a study for our learning, but an example
   for reproduction. The first out of these points in which, I think, we
   should imitate him is this:--

   I. UNDER DESERTION OF SOUL, THE LORD JESUS STILL TURNS TO GOD.

   At that time when he uttered these words, God had left him to his
   enemies. No angel appeared to interpose and destroy the power of Roman
   or Jew. He seemed utterly given up. The people might mock at him, and
   they might put him to what pain they pleased j at the same time a sense
   of God's love to him as man was taken from him. The comfortable
   presence of God, which had all his life long sustained him, began to
   withdraw from him in the garden, and appeared to be quite gone when he
   was just in the article of death upon the cross; and meanwhile the
   waves of God's wrath on account of sin began to break over his spirit,
   and he was in the condition of a soul deserted by God. Now sometimes
   believers come into the same condition, not to the same extent, but in
   a measure. Yesterday they were full of joy, for the love of God was
   shed abroad in their hearts, but to-day that sense of love is gone;
   they droop; they feel heavy. Now the temptation will be at such times
   for them to sit down and look into their own hearts; and if they do,
   they will grow more wretched every moment, until they will come well
   nigh to despair; for there is no comfort to be found within, when there
   is no light from above. Our signs and tokens within are like sundials.
   We can tell what is o'clock by the sundial when the sun shines, but if
   it does not what is the use of the sundial? And so marks of evidence
   may help us when God's love is shed abroad in the soul, but when that
   is done, marks of evidence stand us in very little stead. Now observe
   our Lord. He is deserted of God, but instead of looking in, and saying,
   "My soul, why art thou this? Why art thou that? Why art thou cast down?
   Why dost thou mourn?" he looks straight away from that dried-up well
   that is within, to those eternal waters that never can be stayed, and
   which are always full of refreshment. He cries, "My God." He knows
   which way to look, and I say to every Christian here, it is a
   temptation of the devil, when you are desponding, and when you are not
   enjoying your religion as you did, to begin peering and searching about
   in the dunghill of your own corruptions, and stirring over all that you
   are feeling, and all you ought to feel, and all you do not feel, and
   all that. Instead of that look from within, look above, look to your
   God again, for the light will come there.

   And you will notice that our Lord did not at this time look to any of
   his friends. In the beginning of his sufferings he appeared to seek
   oonsolation from his disciples, but he found them sleeping for sorrow;
   therefore, on this occasion he did not look to them in any measure. He
   had lost the light or God's countenance, but he does not look down in
   the darkness and say, "John, dear faithful John, art thou there? Hast
   thou not a word for him whose bosom was a pillow for thy head? Mother
   Mary, art thou there? Canst thou not say one soft word to thy dying son
   to let him know there is still a heart that does not forget him?" No,
   beloved; our Lord did not look to the creature. Man as he was, and we
   must regard him as such in uttering this cry, yet he does not look to
   friend or brother, helper or human arm. But though God be angry, as it
   were, yet he crieth, "My God." Oh! it is the only cry that befits a
   believer's lips. Even if God seems to forsake thee, keep on crying to
   him. Do not begin to look in a pet and a jealous humour to creatures,
   but still look to thy God. Depend upon it, he will come to thee sooner
   or later. He cannot fail thee. He must help thee. Like a child if its
   mother strike it, still if it be in pain it cries for its mother; it
   knows her love; it knows its deep need of her, and that she alone can
   supply its need. Oh! beloved, do the same. Is there one in this house
   who has lately lost his comforts, and Satan has said, "Don't pray"?
   Beloved, pray more than ever you did. If the devil says, "Why, God is
   angry; what is the use of praying to him?" he might have said the same
   to Christ--"Why dost thou pray to one who forsaketh thee?" But Christ
   did pray "My God" still, though he says, "Why dost thou forsake me?"
   Perhaps Satan tells you not to read the Bible again. It has not
   comforted you of late; the promises have not come to your soul. Dear
   brother, read and read more; read double as much as ever you did. Do
   not think that, because there is no light coming to you, the wisest way
   is to get away from the light. No; stay where the light is. And perhaps
   he even says to you, "Don't attend the house of God again; don't go to
   the communion table. Why, surely you won't wish to commune with God
   when he hides his face from you." I say the words of wisdom, for I
   speak according to the example of Christ; come still to your God in
   private and in public worship, and come still, dear brother, to the
   table of fellowship with Jesus, saying, "Though he slay me, vet will I
   trust in him, for I have nowhere else to trust; and though he hide his
   face from me, vet will I cry after him, and my cry shall not be "My
   friends," but "My God"; and my eye shall not look to my soul, my
   friends, or my feelings, but I will look to my God. and even to him
   alone. That is the first lesson, not an easy one to learn, mark
   you--easier to hear than you will find it to practice. but "the Spirit
   helpeth our infirmities." The second lesson is this--observe that:--

   II. THOUGH UNDER A SENSE OF DESERTION, OUR MASTER DOES NOT RELAX HIS
   HOLD OF HIS GOD.

   Observe it, "My God"--it is one hand he grips him with; "My God"--it is
   the other hand he grasps him with. Both united in the cry, "My God." He
   believes that God is still his God. He uses the possessive particle
   twice, "My God, my God."

   Now it is easy to believe that God is ours when he smiles upon us, and
   when we have the sweet fellowship of his love in our hearts; but the
   point for faith to attend to, is to hold to God when he gives the hard
   words, when his providence frowns upon thee, and when even his Spirit
   seems to be withdrawn from thee. Oh! let go every thing, but let not go
   thy God. If the ship be tossed and ready to sink, and the tempest rages
   exceedingly, cast out the ingots, let the gold go, throw out the wheat,
   as Paul's companions did. Let even necessaries go, but oh! still hold
   to thy God; give not up thy God; say still, notwithstanding all, "In
   the teeth of all my feelings, doubts, and suspicions, I hold him yet;
   he is my God; I will not let him go."

   You know that in the text our Lord calls God in the original his
   "strong one"--"Eli, Eli"--"my strong one, my mighty one." So let the
   Christian, when God turns away the brightness of his presence, still
   believe that all his strength lies in God, and that, moreover, God's
   power is on his side. Though it seemed to crush him, yet faith says,
   "It is a power that will not crush me. If he smite me, what will I do?
   I will lay hold upon his arm, and he will put strength in me. I will
   deal with God as Jacob did with the angel. If he wrestle with me, I
   will borrow strength from him, and I will wrestle still with him until
   I get the blessing from him." Beloved, we must neither let go God, nor
   let go our sense of his power to save us. We must hold to our
   possession of him, and hold to the belief that he is worth possessing,
   that he is God allsufficient, and that he is our God still.

   Now I would like to put this personally to any tried child of God here.
   Are you going to let go your God because you have lost his smile? Then
   I ask you, Did you base your faith upon his smile? for if you did, you
   mistook the true ground of faith. The ground of a believer's confidence
   is not God's smile, but God's promise. It is not his temporary sunshine
   of his love, but his deep eternal love itself, as it reveals itself in
   the covenant and in the promises. Now the present smile of God may go,
   but God's promise does not go; and if you believe upon God's promise,
   that is just as true when God frowns as when he smiles. If you are
   resting upon the covenant, that covenant is as true in the dark as in
   the light. It stands as good when your soul is without a single gleam
   of oonsolation as when your heart is flooded with sacred bliss. Oh!
   Come then to this. The promise is as good as ever. Christ is the same
   as ever; his blood is as great a plea as ever; and the oath of God is
   as immutable as ever. We must get away from all building upon our
   apprehensions of God's love. It is the love itself we must build
   on--not on our enjoyment of his presence, but on his faithfulness and
   on his truth. Therefore, be not cast down, but still call him, "My
   God."

   Moreover, I may put it to you, if, because God frowns, you give him up,
   what else do you mean to do? Why, is not it better to trust in an angry
   God than not to trust in God at all? Suppose thou leavest off the walk
   of faith, what wilt thou do? The carnal man never knew what faith was,
   and, therefore, gets on pretty fairly in his own blind, dead way; but
   you have been quickened and made alive, enlightened, and if you give up
   your faith, what is to become of you? Oh! hold to him then.

   "For if shine eye oi faith be dim,

   Still hold on Jesus, sink or swim;

   Still at his footstool bow the knee

   And Israel's God thy strength shall be."

   Don't give him up.

   Moreover, if faith give up her God because he frowns, what sort of a
   faith was it? Canst thou not believe in a frowning God? What, hast thou
   a friend who did the other day but give thee a rough word, and thou
   saidst, "At one time I could die for that man," and because he gives
   you one rough word, are you going to give him up? Is this thy kindness
   to thy friends Is this thy confidence in thy God? But how Job played
   the man! Did he turn against his God when he took away his comforts
   from him? No; he said, "The Lord gave, and the Lord bath taken away,
   and blessed be the name of the Lord." And do you not know how he put it
   best of all when he said, "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him
   "? Yes, if thy faith be only a fair-weather faith, if thou canst only
   walk with God when he sandals thee in silver, and smooths the path
   beneath thy feet, what faith is this? Where didst thou get it from? But
   the faith that can foot it with the Lord through Nebuchadnezzar's
   furnace of fire, and that can go walking with him through the valley of
   the shadow of death--this is the faith to be had and sought after, and
   God grant it to us, for that was the faith that was in the heart of
   Christ when forsaken of God. He yet says, "My God."

   We have learnt two lessons. Now we have learnt them--(we have gone over
   them, but have we learnt them?)--may we practice them, and turn to God
   in ill times, and not relinquish our hold. The third lesson is this:--

   III. ALTHOUGH OUR LORD UTTERED THIS DEEP AND BITTER CRY OF PAIN, YET
   LEARN FROM HIS SILENCE.

   He never uttered a single syllable of murmuring, or brought any
   accusation against his God. "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" There!
   look at those words. Can you see any blots in them? I cannot. They are
   crystallised sorrow. but there is no defilement of sin. It was just (I
   was about to say) what an angel could have said, if he could have
   suffered; it is what the Son of God did say, who was purer than angels,
   when he was suffering. Listen to Job, and we must not condemn Job, for
   we should not have been half so good as he, I daresay; but he does let
   his spirit utter itself sometimes in bitterness. He curses the day of
   his birth and so on; but the Lord Jesus does not do that. There is not
   a syllable about "cursed be the day in which I was born in Bethlehem,
   and in which I came amongst such a rebellious race as this"--nor not a
   word, not a word. And even the best of men when in sorrow have at least
   wished that things were not just so. David, when he had lost Absalom,
   wished that he had died, instead of Absalom. But Christ does not appear
   to want things altered. He does not say, "Lord, this is a mistake.
   Would God I had died by the hands of Herod when he sought my life, or
   had perished when they tried to throw me down the hill of Capernaum."
   No; nothing of the kind. There is grief, but there is no complaining;
   there is sorrow, but there is no rebellion. Now this is the point,
   beloved, I want to bring to you. If you should suffer extremely, and it
   should ever come to that terrible pinch that even God's love and the
   enjoyment of it appears to be gone, put your finger to your lip and
   keep it there. "I was dumb with silence; I opened not my mouth, because
   thou didst it." Believe that he is a good God still. Know that
   assuredly he is working for thy good, even now, and let not a syllable
   escape thee by way of murmuring, or if it does, repent of it and recall
   it. Thou hast a right to speak to God, but not to murmur against him,
   and if thou wouldst be like thy Lord, thou wouldst say just this, "Why
   hast thou forsaken me?" But thou wilt say no more, and there wilt thou
   leave him, and if' there oome no answer to thy question thou wilt be
   content to be without an answer.

   Now again, I say, this is a lesson I can teach, but I do not know if I
   can practice it, and I do not know that you can. Only, again, "the
   Spirit helpeth our infirmities," and he will enable us when we come to
   "lama sabachthani" to come so far, but not to go farther--to stop there
   with our Lord. The fourth lesson which, I think, we should learn is
   this:--

   IV. OUR LORD, WHEN HE DOES CRY, CRIES WITH THE INQUIRING VOICE OF A
   LOVING CHILD.

   "My God, why, ah! why hast thou forsaken me?" He asks a question not in
   curiosity, but in love. Loving, sorrowful complaints he brings. "Why,
   my God? Why? Why?" Now this is a lesson to us, because we ought to
   endeavour to find out why it is that God hides himself from us. No
   Christian ought to be content to live without full assurance of faith.
   No believer ought to be satisfied to live a moment without knowing to a
   certainty that Christ is his, and if he does not know it, and assurance
   is gone, what ought he to do? Why, he should never be content until he
   has gone to God with the question, "Why have I not this assurance? Why
   have I not thy presence? Why is it that I cannot live once I did in the
   light of thy countenance "And, beloved, the answer to this question in
   our case will sometimes be, "I have forsaken thee, my child, because
   thou hast forsaken me. Thou hast grown cold of heart by slow degrees;
   grey hairs have come upon thee, and thou didst not know; and I have
   made thee know it to make thee see thy backsliding, and sorrowfully
   repent of it." Sometimes the answer will be, "My child, I have forsaken
   thee because thou hast set up an idol in thy heart. Thou lovest thy
   child too much, thy gold too much, thy trade too much; and I cannot
   come into thy soul unless I am thy Lord, thy love, thy bridegroom, and
   thy all." Oh! we shall be glad to know these answers, because the
   moment we know them our heart will say:--

   "The dearest idol I heve known,

   Whate'er that idol be,

   Help me to tear it from its throne,

   And worship only thee."

   Sometimes the Lord's answer will be, "My child, I have gone from thee
   for a little to try thee, to see if thou lovest me." A true lover will
   love on under frowns. It is only the superficial professor that wants
   sweetmeats every day, and only loves his God for what he gets out of
   him; but the genuine believer loves him when he smites him, when he
   bruises him with the bruises of a cruel one. Why, then we will say, "O
   God, if this is why thou dost forsake us, we will love thee still, and
   prove to thee that thy grace has made our souls to hunger and thirst
   for thee." Depend upon it, the best way to get away from trouble, or to
   get great help under it, is to run close in to God. In one of Quarles's
   poems he has the picture of a man striking another with a great nail.
   Now the further off the other is, the heavier it strikes him. So the
   man whom God is smiting runs close in, and he cannot be hurt at all. O
   my God, my God, when away from thee affliction stuns me, but I will
   close with thee, and then even my affliction I will take to be a cause
   of glory, and glory in tribulations also, so that thy blast shall not
   sorely wound my spirit.

   Well, I leave this point with the very same remark I made before. To
   cry to God with the enquiry of a child is the fourth lesson of the
   text. Oh! learn it well. Do practice it when You are in trouble much.
   If you are in such a condition at this time, practice it now, and in
   the pew say, "Show me wherefore thou contendest with me. Search me and
   try me, and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
   way everlasting." Now the fifth observation is one to be treasured
   up:--

   V. THAT OUR LORD, THOUGH HE WAS FORSAKEN OF GOD, STILL PURSUED HIS
   FATHER'S WORK--the work he came to do. "My God, why hast thou forsaken
   me?" But, mark you, he does not leave the cross; he does not unloose
   the nails as he might have done with a will; he did not leap down
   amidst the assembled mockers, and scorn them in return, and chase them
   far away. but he kept on bleeding, suffering, even until he could say,
   "It is finished," and he did not give up the ghost till it was
   finished. Now, beloved, I find it, and I daresay you do, a very easy
   and pleasant thing to go on serving God when I have got a full sense of
   his love, and Christ shining in my face, when every text brings joy to
   my heart, and when I see souls converted, and know that God is going
   with the Word to bless it. That is very easy, but to keep on serving
   God when you get nothing for it but blow--when there is no success, and
   when your own heart is in deep darkness of spirit--I know the
   temptation. Perhaps you are under it. Because you have not the joy you
   once had, you say, "I must give up preaching; I must give up that
   Sunday School. If I have not the light of God's countenance, how can I
   do it? I must give it up." Beloved, you must do no such thing. Suppose
   there were a loyal subject in a nation, and he had done something or
   other which grieved the king, and the king on a certain day turned his
   face from him, do you think that loyal subject would go away and
   neglect his duty because the king frowned? No; methinks he would say to
   himself, "I do not know why the king seemed to deal hardly with me. He
   is a good king, and I know he is good, if he does not see any good in
   me, and I will work for him more than ever. I will prove to him that my
   loyalty does not depend upon his smiles. I am his loyal subject, and
   will stand to him still." What would you say to your child if you had
   to chasten him for doing wrong, if he were to go away and say, "I shall
   not attend to the errand that father has sent me upon, and I shall do
   no more in the house that father has commanded me to do, because father
   has beaten me this morning"? Ah! what a disobedient child! If the
   scourging had its fit effect upon him, he would say, "I will wrong thee
   no more, father, lest thou smite me again." So let it be with us.

   Besides, should not our gratitude compel us to go on working for God?
   Has not he saved us from hell? Then we may say, with the old heathen,
   "Strike, so long as thou forgivest." Yes, if God forgives, he may
   strike if he will. Suppose a judge should forgive a malefactor
   condemned to die, but he should say to him, "Though you are not to be
   executed as you deserve, yet, for all that, you must be put in prison
   for some years," he would say, "Ah! my Lord, I will take this lesser
   ohastisement, so long as my life is saved." And oh! if our God has
   saved us from going down to the pit by putting his own Son to death on
   our behalf, we will love him for that, if we never have anything more.
   If, between here and heaven, we should have to say, like the elder
   brother, "Thou never gayest me a kid that I might make merry with my
   friends." we will love him still; and if he never does anything to us
   between here and glory, but lay us on a sick bed, and torture us there,
   yet still we will praise and bless him, for he has saved us from going
   down to the pit; therefore, we will love him as long as we live. Oh! if
   you think of God as you ought to do, you will not be at ups and downs
   with him, but you will serve him with all your heart, and soul, and
   might, whether you are enjoying the light of his countenance or not.
   Now to close. Our Lord is an example for us in one other matter. He is
   to us our type of what shall happen to us, for whereas he said, "Why
   hast thou forsaken me?":--

   VI. HE HAS RECEIVED A GLORIOUS ANSWER.

   And so shall every man that, in the same spirit in the hour of
   darkness, asks the same question. Our Lord died. No answer had he got
   to the question, but the question went on ringing through earth, and
   heaven, and hell. Three days he slept in the grave, and after a while
   he went Into heaven, and my imagination, I think, may be allowed if I
   say that as he entered there the echo of his words, "Why hast thou
   forsaken me?" just died away, and then the Father gave him the
   practical answer to the question; for there, all along the golden
   streets, stood white-robed bands, all of them singing their redeemer's
   praise, all of them chanting the name of Jehovah and the Lamb; and this
   was a part of the answer to his question. God had forsaken Christ that
   these chosen spirits might live through him; they were the reward for
   the travail of his soul; they were the answer to his question; and ever
   since then, between heaven and earth, there has been constant commerce.
   Ii your eyes were opened that you could see, you would perceive in the
   sky not falling stars, shooting downwards, but stars rising upward from
   England, many every hour from America, from all countries where the
   gospel is believed, and from heathen lands where the truth is preached
   and God is owned, for you would see every now and then down on earth a
   dying bed, but upwards through the skies, mounting among the stars,
   another spirit shot upward to complete the constellations of the
   glorified. And as these bright ones, all redeemed by his sufferings,
   enter heaven, they bring to Christ fresh answers to that question, "Why
   hast thou forsaken me?" And if stooping from his throne in glory the
   Prince of life takes view of the sons of men who are lingering here,
   even in this present assembly, he will see to-night a vast number of us
   met together around this table, I hope the most, if not all, of us
   redeemed by his blood and rejoicing in his salvation; and the Father
   points down to-night to this Tabernacle, and to thousands of similar
   scenes where believers cluster around the table of fellowship with
   their Lord, and he seems to say to the Saviour, "There is my answer to
   thy question, 'Why hast thou forsaken me?'"

   Now, beloved, we shall have an answer to our question something like
   that. When we get to heaven, perhaps not until then, God will tell us
   why he forsook us. When I tossed upon my bed three months ago in weary
   pain that robbed me of my night's rest, and my day's rest too, I asked
   why it was I was there, but I have realized since the reason, for God
   helped me afterwards so to preach that many souls were ingathered.
   Often you will find that God deserts you that he may be with you after
   a nobler sort--hides the light, that afterwards the light of seven suns
   at once may break in upon your spirit, and there you shall learn that
   it was for his glory that he left you, for his glory that he tried your
   faith. Only mind you stand to that. Still cry to him, and still call
   him God, and never complain, hut ask him why, and pursue his work still
   under all difficulties; so being like Christ on earth, you shall be
   like Christ above, as to the answer.

   I cannot sit down without saying just this word. God will never forsake
   his people for ever. But as many of you as are not his people, if you
   have not believed in him, he will forsake you for ever, and for ever,
   and for ever; and if you ask, "Why hast thou forsaken me? "you will
   get, your answer in the echo of your words, "Thou hast forsaken me."
   "How shall ye escape if ye neglect so great salvation?"! "Believe in
   the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."

   "But if your ears refuse

   The language of his grace,

   And hearts grow hard like stubborn Jews,

   That unbelieving race;

   The Lord in vengeance drest

   Shall life his hand and swear,

   'You that despised my promised rest

   Shall have no portion there.'"

   God grant it may never be so with you, for Christ's sake. Amen

                             Light at Evening Time

   A Sermon

   (No. 3508)

   Published on Thursday, April 20th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [16]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be
   clear nor dark: But it shall be one day which shall be known to the
   Lord, not day, nor night; but it shall come to pass, that at evening
   time it shall be light."--Zechariah 14:6-7.

   AS WE read the Scriptures, we are continually startled by fresh
   discoveries of the magnificence of God. Our attention is fixed upon a
   passage, and presently sparklets of fire and glory dart forth. It
   strikes us; we are struck by it. Hence these bright coruscations. Our
   admiration is excited. We could not have thought that so much light
   could possibly lie concealed within a few words. Our text thus reveals
   to us in a remarkable manner the penetration, the discernment, the
   clear-sightedness of God. To our weak vision the current of human
   affairs is like twilight. It is not altogether dark, for it is broken
   with some gleams of hope. Nor is it altogether bright, for heavy masses
   of darkness intervene. It is neither day nor night. There is a
   mingle-mangle of good and evil, a strange confused mixture, wherein the
   powers of darkness con tend with the powers of light. But it is not so
   with God. With him, it is one clear day. What we think to be confusion,
   is order before his eye. Where we see advance and retrogression, he
   sees perpetual progress. We full often bemoan our circumstances as
   altogether disastrous, while God, who seeth the end from the beginning,
   is working out his ordained purpose. Our God maketh the clouds to be
   the dust of his feet, and the winds to be his chariot. He sees order in
   the tempest and the whirlwind. When the bosom of earth heaves with
   earthquake, he hears music in every throb and when earth and heaven
   seem mingled in one wild disorder and storm, his hand is in the midst
   of all, so marking, that every particle of matter should be obedient to
   his settled laws, and that all things should work together to produce
   one glorious result. "Things are not what they seem." Oh! how good it
   is for us to know that this world's history is not so black and bad as
   to our dim senses it would appear. God is writing it out, sometimes
   with a heavy pen; but when complete, it will read like one great poem,
   magnificent in its plan, and perfect in all its details. At the present
   hour there may be much in the condition of our country to cause anxiety
   or even to create alarm. And it is not hard to point certainly to many
   things that seem to augur no good. But there always were evil prophets.
   There always have been times and crises when dark portents favoured
   unwelcome predictions. But thus far the fury of every tempest has been
   mitigated; a sweet calm has followed each perilous swell of the ocean,
   and the good old ship has kept afloat England's flag--we fondly
   believe:--

   "The flag that's braved a thousand years,

   The battle and the breeze,"

   will not be run down yet. We thank God that the history of our
   deliverances supplies us with fair omens of an ever-gracious
   Providence. Let us comfort ourselves with the belief that there is a
   future of peace and prosperity within her borders and of influence for
   good among the nations of the world for Britain and British Christians.
   Then let each man brace up his sinews for the fight, and struggle for
   the right Bright days are assuredly in store for those who lift the
   standard and unfurl the flag of righteousness and truth. "At evening
   time it shall be light." Even now it is "one day" which is known to the
   Lord.

   As our time is brief, I mean to confine your attention to one clause of
   the text, "At evening time it shall be light." It seems to be a rule in
   God's dispensations that his light should break upon men gradually; and
   when it appears about to suffer an eclipse it will brighten up and
   shine with extraordinary lustre. "At evening time it shall be light."
   Of this mode of God's procedure we will take five illustrations.

   I. LET REVELATION SUPPLY US WITH THE FIRST.

   When God first revealed himself to the sons of men, he did not come to
   them in a blazing chariot of fire, manifesting all his glorious
   attributes. The sun in the Tropics, we are told, rises on a sudden. The
   inhabitants of those regions know none of our delightful twilight at
   dawn or evening, but the curtain rises and falls abruptly. This is not
   the way in which God has revealed himself to us by degrees, softly,
   slowly, he lifts the veil. Thus has God been pleased to make himself
   known. He took in his hand a flaming, torch when the world was dark.
   Without a single ray of comfort, and he lit up the first star that ever
   shone over the wild waste of the world's wilderness. That star was the
   promise that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head. In
   the light of that promise our first parents and their immediate
   descendants were cheered in their daily toil. Seth and Enoch walked
   with no other light that we know of but that. There is no record of any
   promise beside, which they had received from the Lord. By-and-bye, as
   years revolved, God lit up another star, and then another and another,
   till at last Holy Scripture became like our sky at midnight-studded all
   over with greater and lesser luminaries, all brightly manifesting the
   glory of God.

   Still it was night. Though there was a little light, there was a
   prevalence of darkness. All through the Jewish dispensation, the sun
   did not shine. There was only cold, but beautous in its season, silver
   moonlight. Heavenly truths were reflected in shadows; the substance was
   not visible. It was an economy of cloud and smoke, of type and symbol,
   but not of light and day of life, and immortality. For all the light
   that "o'er the dark her silver mantle threw," the saints of those times
   were glad and grateful; but how much more cause for joy and gratitude
   have we on whom the golden sun has shone! Star after star had been lit
   up in the heavens by the inspiration of Moses, and Samuel, and David,
   and all the prophets, till dark and deep the night began to fall, till
   sable clouds gathered dense with direful auguries. and at length a wild
   tempest was heard thundering in the sky. Isaiah had completed the long
   roll of his prophecy; Jeremiah had uttered all his lamentations. The
   eagle wing of Ezekiel soared no longer. Daniel had recorded his visions
   and entered into rest. Zechariah and Haggai had fulfilled their
   mission, and at last Malachi, foreseeing the day that should burn as an
   oven, and beyond it the day when the Sun of righteousness should arise
   with healing in his wings, closed that volume of testimony. That was
   midnight. The stare seemed to be dying out, like as withered fig-leaves
   fall from the tree. There was no open vision; the Word of God was
   scarce; there was a famine of the bread of life in those days. And what
   then? Why, you all know. At evening time it was light. Be who had long
   been promised suddenly came into his temple, a light to lighten the
   Gentiles, and to be the glory of his people Israel. The world's darkest
   hour had come, when there was born in Bethlehem, of the house of David,
   Jesus, the Kin, of the Jews, and the Saviour of men. Then the day
   dawned, and the day-spring from on high visited us, precisely at that
   darkest hour, when men said, "God has forsaken the world, and left it
   to pine away in everlasting gloom". Let that serve for a first
   illustration of light at evening time, notable as a fact, and worthy to
   be recollected. This, too, is precisely the way in which God acts:--

   II. IN THE CONVERSION OF INDIVIDUALS.

   God's laws on a great scale are always the same as his laws on little
   scale. A pretty little rhyme, that many of you are familiar with,
   endorses this statement.

   "The very law that moulds a tear,

   And bids it trickle from its source

   That law preserves the world a sphere,

   And guides the planets in their course."

   The same law which controls a planet affects a grain of dust. As God
   caused revelation to arise gradually, and, growing clearer and clearer,
   to become clearest when it seemed about to expire, so in the experience
   of each individual, the dawn precedes the day. When the light of divine
   grace first visits a man, it shines with feeble beam. Man by nature is,
   like a house shut up, the windows of which are all boarded over. Grace
   does not open every window jet once and bid the sun stream in upon weak
   eyes accustomed to darkness. It rather takes down a part of a shutter
   at a time, removes some obstruction, and so lets in, through chinks, a
   little light, that one may be able to bear it by degrees. The window of
   man's soul is so thickly encrusted with dirt, so thoroughly begrimed,
   that no light at all can penetrate it, till one layer is taken off, and
   a little yellow light is seen; and then another is removed, and then
   another, still admitting more light, and clearer. Was it not so with
   you who are now walking in the light of God's countenance, Did not your
   light come to you by little and little? Your experience, I know,
   confirms my statement, and as the light came, and you discovered your
   sin, and began to see the suitability of Christ to meet your case, you
   hoped that all was going on well. Then peradventure, on a sudden, the
   light seemed altogether to depart. You were cast into the thick
   darkness into the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and you said, "Oh! now
   my lamp is put out for ever! I am cast out from God's presence! I am
   doomed beyond the hope of mercy! I shall be lost for ever and ever!"
   Well now, Christian, ask yourself what came of this? When you were thus
   broken, sore broken in the place of dragons, and your soul suffered the
   wreck of all its carnal confidence , what then? At that evening time
   the light shone clearer with you than it had ever before. When darkness
   veiled your mind, you looked to Christ, and were lightened with the
   true light. Despairing of yourself, you cast yourself into the arms of
   Christ, and you had that peace of God which passeth all understanding,
   and still keeps your heart and mind through Jesus Christ.

   May be I am addressing some who have been for a long while the subjects
   of such humbling influences, breaking them down. You had hoped things
   were going pretty fairly with you, and you trusted that at the last you
   would come out into clear sunshine. But oh! how disappointed you feel!
   You never felt so wicked, never knew that you were so desperately
   rebellious. Your heart is hard and stubborn; you feel as if there was a
   mutiny in your breast. "Surely," you say, "such an one as I am never
   can be saved; it is a hopeless case." Oh! my brother, very hopeful to
   our view is that which appears so hopeless to you.

   "Tis perfect poverty alone

   That sets the soul at large;

   While we can call one mite our own,

   We have no full discharge."

   Are you emptied of all merit, goodness, and hope in yourselves? Then
   your redemption draweth nigh. When you are cleared out and turned
   upside down, then eternal mercy greets you. Trust Christ. If you cannot
   swim, give yourselves up to the stream, and you shall float. If you
   cannot stand, give yourselves up to him, and he will bear you as on
   eagles' wings. Give up yourself. There, let it die; it is the worst
   enemy you ever had. Though you relied upon it, it has been a delusion
   and a snare to you. Now, therefore, throw the whole weight and burden
   of your life of sin and folly upon Jesus' Christ, the Sin-bearer, and
   this shall be the time of your deliverance, so the darkest hour you
   ever knew shall give place to the brightest you have ever experienced.
   You shall go your way rejoicing, with a joy unspeakable and full of
   glory. A third illustration may be found in:--

   III. THE DELIVERANCES WHICH A COVENANT GOD WORKS FOR AN AFFLICTED
   PEOPLE

   The same rule which we have already observed will hold good here--at
   evening time it shall be light. No child of God can be very long
   without trouble of some kind or other, for sure it is that the road to
   heaven will always be rough. Some visionaries have been talking of
   making a railroad to the city. With this view, they would fill up the
   Slough of Despond, run a tramway right through the middle of it, and
   construct a tunnel through the hill Difficulty. I would not advise any
   of you to be shareholders in the company, for it will never answer. It
   will bring thousands to the river of Death, and swamp them there, but
   at the gates of the Celestial City not a passenger will ever arrive by
   that route. There is a pilgrimage, and a weary pilgrimage too, which
   must be taken before you can obtain entrance into those gates. Still,
   in all their trials, God's people always find it true that at evening
   time it shall be light. Are you suffering from temporal troubles. You
   cannot expect to be without these. They are hard to bear. This,
   however, should cheer you, that God is as much engaged to succour and
   support you in your temporal, as he is in your spiritual interests.
   Beloved, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Not a sparrow
   falls on the ground without your Father knowing it. Well, now, taking
   quite a material view of the question, you are of more value than many
   sparrows. You may be very poor, yet be very, very dear to your Father
   in heaven. Your poverty may reduce you to the utmost pinch, but that
   will be the time of your sweetest relief. The widow woman at the gates
   of Zarepta could hardly have been more wretched than when she had gone
   out to gather a few sticks--she says two--enough, I suppose, to cook
   the handful of meal and the few drops of oil, with which to make the
   last morsel for herself and for her son. Ay, poor soul! At that very
   moment the prophet of God came in--not while there was much meal or
   much oil, but just as they were all spent. He came to tell her that the
   barrel of meal should not waste, nor the cruse of oil fail, till the
   Lord sent rain, and famine ceased in the land. God's people in Egypt
   were not brought out until the rigour of their bondage had become too
   bitter to bear. When it was intolerable, the Lord redeemed them with a
   strong arm and a high hand. You may, my dear hearer, be so tried that
   you think nobody ever had such a trial. Well, then, your faith may look
   out for such a deliverance as nobody else ever experienced. If you have
   an excess of grief, you shall have the more abundant relief. If you
   have been alone in sorrow, you shall, by-and-bye, have a joy
   unspeakable, with which no stranger can intermeddle. You shall lead the
   song of praise, as chief musicians, whose wailings were most bitter in
   the abodes of woe. Do cast your burden on God. Let me beseech those of
   you who love him, not to be shy of him. Disclose to him your temporal
   griefs. For you, young people, you remember I have just prayed that you
   might early in life learn to cast your burden upon God. Your trials and
   troubles, while you are at home under your father's roof, are not so
   heavy as those that will come when you begin to shift for yourselves.
   Still, you may think them heavier, because your older friends make
   light of them. Well, while you yet remain at the home of your
   childhood, acquire the habit of carrying your daily troubles and griefs
   to God. Whisper them into your Heavenly Father's ear, and he will help
   you. And why should you men of business try to weather the storm
   without your God? 'Tis well to have industry, shrewdness, and what is
   called self-reliance--a disposition to meet difficulties with
   determination, not with despondency:--

   "To take arms against a sea of troubles,

   And by opposing end them."

   Still, the only safe, the only happy course for merchant or tradesman
   is to commit his way unto God, with a simple, child-like faith, taking
   counsel at the Scriptures, and seeking guidance in prayer. You will
   find it to be a blessed way of passing through the ordinary routine of
   daily anxieties, and the extraordinary pressure of occasional alarms
   and panics, if you can but realise your sacred privileges as disciples
   of Christ in the midst of all your secular duties.

   Or are our trials of a spiritual character? Here full often our trials
   abound, and here, too, we may expect that at evening time it shall be
   light. Perhaps some of you pursue the road to heaven with very few
   soul-conflicts. Certainly there are some who do not often get through a
   week without being troubled on every side-fighting without, and fears
   within. Ah! brethren, when some of you tell me of your doubts and
   fears, I can well sympathise with you, if I cannot succour you. Is
   there anywhere a soul more vexed with doubts, and fears, and
   soul-conflicts than mine? I know not one. With heights of joy in
   serving my Master, I am happily familiar, but into very depths of
   despair-such an inward sinking as I cannot describe-I have likewise
   sunk. A more frequent, or a more fearful wretchedness of heart than I
   have suffered it is not likely any of you ever felt. Yet do I know that
   my Redeemer liveth, that the battle is sure, that the victory is safe.
   If my testimony be worth aught, I have always found that when I am most
   distressed about circumstances that I cannot control, when my hope
   seems to flicker where it ought to flare, when the worthlessness and
   wretchedness of my nature obscure the evident of any goodness and
   virtue imparted to me or wrought in me, just then it is that a sweet
   spring of cool consolation bubbles up to quench my thirst, and a sweet
   voice greets my ear, "It is I; be not afraid". My witness is for the
   Master, that, though he may leave us for a little, it is not for long.
   "For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercy have I
   gathered thee; in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment,
   but with everlasting mercy will I have pity upon thee, saith the Lord,
   thy Redeemer. "Oh! believer, stay yourself upon God when you have
   nothing else to stay upon. Do not rely upon appearances; above all, do
   not listen to the suggestions of a murmuring, hardened spirit; do not
   credit the insinuations of the infernal fiend who, when he finds you
   downhearted, be it from sickness of body or anxiety of mind, is sure
   then to whisper some disparaging thoughts of God. What though the
   suggestion strikes your heart that the Lord has forsaken you, that your
   sins cannot be forgiven, that you will fall by the hand of the enemy,
   hurl it back. You know whence it came. Depend upon it, though heaven
   and earth go to wreck, God's promise will stand. Should hell break
   loose, and demons innumerable invade this earth, they shall not go one
   inch beyond their tether. The chain that God has cast about them shall
   restrain them. Not an heir of heaven shall be left to the clutch of the
   destroyer. Nay, his head shall not lose a hair without divine
   permission. You shall come out of the furnace with not a smell of fire
   upon you. And being so eminently preserved, in such imminent peril,
   your salvation shall constrain you to bless God on earth, and bless him
   to all eternity, with the deepest self-humiliation and the highest
   strains of gratitude and adoration. So, then, both in our temporal and
   spiritual concerns, at evening time, when the worst has come to the
   worst, it shall be light. When the tide has ebbed out the farthest, it
   will begin to flow in. When the winter has advanced to the shortest
   day, we shall then begin to return to spring. Be assured that it is so,
   it has been so, and it shall be so. To the very end of your days you
   may look for light at evening time. And now may I not appeal for a
   fourth illustration of the same truth to some of our friends who have
   come to:--

   IV. THE EVENING TIME OF HUMAN LIFE?

   This is often a delightful time, when the shadows are drawn out, and
   the air is still, and there is a season of preparation for the last
   undressing, and of anticipation for the appearing before the King in
   his beauty. I envy some of our brethren, the more advanced saints.
   Although old age brings its infirmities and its sorrows, yet they have
   found that brings with it the mellow joys of a matured experience, and
   a near prospect of the coming glory so near, so very near to their
   actual realisation. John Bunyan's picture of the Land Beulah was no
   dream, though he calls it so. Some of our aged brethren and sisters
   have come to a place of very peaceful repose, where they do hear the
   songs of angels from the other side of the stream, and the bundles of
   myrrh from the mountains of Bethen they bear in their bosoms. I know
   you find, my dear friends, that at evening time it is light to you,
   very light. You were called by grace when you were young. Bright was
   your day-dawn; a precious dew from the Lord fell upon you in the
   morning. You have borne the burden and heat of the day. You feel like a
   child that has grown tired. You are ready to say, "Let us go to sleep,
   mother; let us go to sleep." But meanwhile, before you close your eyes
   you are conscious of such divine refreshment, of such love and such joy
   shed abroad in your hearts, that you find the last stage of the journey
   to be blessed indeed, waiting and watching for the trumpet-call that
   shall bid you come up higher. Your light is brighter now than ever it
   was before. When you come at length to depart, though it will be
   "evening time" in very truth, it will be "light." You have watched the
   sun go down sometimes. How glorious he is at his setting! He looks
   twice as large as he did when he was high up in the sky, and if the
   clouds gather round him, how he tints them all with glory! Is there
   anything in all the world so magnificent as the setting sun, when all
   the colours of heaven seem poured out upon earth's sky? It does not
   fill you with gloom, for it is so radiant with glory. Such, now, shall
   your dying bed be. To those who watch you, you shall be an object of
   mare sacred interest than ever you were before. If there be some pains
   that distress you, and some temptations that harass you, they shall be
   but the clouds which your Master's grace and your Saviour's presence
   shall gild with splendour. Oh! how light, how very light, it has been
   at evening time with some of our beloved friends! We have envied them
   as we have beheld the brightness gleaming from their brows in their
   last expiring moments. Oh! their songs! You cannot sing like them. Oh!
   their notes of ecstasy! You cannot understand the bliss unspeakable, as
   though the spray of the waves of heaven dashed into their faces, as
   though the light of the unclouded land had begun to stream upon their
   visage, and they were transfigured upon their Tabor before they passed
   into their rest!

   Never fear dying, beloved. Dying is the last, but the least, matter
   that a Christian has to be anxious about. Fear living-that is a hard
   battle to fight; a stern discipline to endure; a rough voyage to
   undergo. You may well invoke God's omnipotence to your aid. But to die,
   that is to end the strife, to finish your course, to enter the calm
   heaven. Your Captain, your Leader, your Pilot is with you. One moment,
   and it is over: "A gentle wafting to immortal life." It is the
   lingering pulse of life that makes the pains and groans. Death ends
   them all. What a light, oh! what a transparent light it must be when
   the spirit immediately passes through the veil into the glory-land! In
   vain the fancy strives to paint the vision of angels and of disembodied
   spirits, and, above all, the brightness of the glory of Christ the Lamb
   in the midst of the throne! Oh! the joy of that first bowing before the
   Mercy-seat! Oh! the rapture of that first casting the crown at his feet
   who loved us and redeemed us! Oh! the transport of that first folding
   in Immanuel's bosom, that first kiss with the kisses of his mouth, face
   to face! Do you not long for it? May you not say, "drop rapidly, ye
   sands of time! Fly round, ye axles of the running years, and let his
   chariot come, or let our soul soon pass, and leave her mortal frame
   behind, to be for ever with the Lord!" Yes, "at evening time is shall
   be light." Turning now from these personal reflections, we seek our
   last illustration in the mysterious unfolding of destiny, for it is our
   firm belief that:--

   V. IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AT LARGE this saying shall be verified,
   and it shall come to pass that "at evening time it shall be light."

   Darkness has prevailed for a long time, nor does the prospect grow much
   brighter at present. The noble enterprise of our great missionary
   societies is not altogether unrequited. The prayers and efforts of a
   long succession of godly men are not to be accounted vain and
   fruitless, but we commonly feel more cause to lament than to exult. How
   little is the world lit up with the light of God yet! Are there more
   saved souls in the world now than there were a hundred years after
   Christ's death? I do not know that there are. A greater surface is
   covered with the profession of Christianity now, but at that time the
   light was bright where it did shine. I am afraid to say what I think of
   the gloom that is hanging in thick folds of cloud and scud, over the
   nations of the earth. Still the oracle cheers my heart, "At evening
   time it shall be light." Some men prophesy that it will not be so. Long
   ages of delay make them grow impatient. This impatience provokes
   questioning. Those questions invariably tend to unbelief. But who shall
   make void the promises of God? Are not nations to be born in a day?
   Will the wild Arab never bow before the King of Zion? Shall not
   Ethiopia stretch out her arms to God? As children of the day, doth it
   not behove us to walk in the light of the Lord? Divine testimony has
   more weight with us than the conjectures of benighted men! Christ has
   bought this world, and he will have it in possession from the river
   even to the ends of the earth. He has redeemed it, and he will claim it
   for his own. You may rest assured that whatever is contained in the
   scroll of prophecy shall be fulfilled according to the determinate
   counsel and foreknowledge of God. Notwithstanding any difficulties you
   may have in interpreting the seals or the trumpets of the Apocalypse,
   You have no room to doubt that Jesus Christ will be acknowledged King
   of Kings and Lord of Lords over this whole world, and that in every
   corner and nook of it his name will be famous. To him every knee shall
   bow, and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord, to the glory of
   God the Father. Do not be troubled by seers or soothsayers. Rest
   patiently. "Of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I
   write unto you, for ye yourselves know perfectly that the day of the
   Lord so cometh as a thief in the night." As for you, your business is
   to work for the spreading of his kingdom, to be continually scattering
   the light you have, and praying for more, to be waiting upon God for
   more of the tongue of fire, for more of the baptism of the Eternal
   Spirit, for more vital quickening power. When the whole Church shall be
   wakened up to a spirit of earnestness and enterprise, the conversion of
   this world will be speedily accomplished; the idols will then be cast
   to the moles and the bats; anti-Christ shall sink like a millstone in
   the flood, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh
   shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

   Talking but the other day upon missionary affairs with one who
   understands them well, he said, "Sir, we have enough missionaries in
   India now, of all sorts, for the evangelisation of India, if no more
   were sent out, provided that they were the right men." Oh! God, call,
   qualify, send for the right men; baptize them with the Holy Ghost and
   with fire; and make them fit instruments to do, to dare, to die, but
   withal to conquer. Bethink you, brethren, how, when Christ began with
   twelve men, he shook the earth, and now that Christians are numbered by
   tens of thousands, do ye tell me that the glory of God is not to be
   revealed, and the conquest of the world is not to be completed? I am
   afraid the Church is getting downhearted. She holds her banner low; she
   marches to the fight with bated breath and tremulous spirit. She will
   never win thus with craven heart. Oh! that she had more faith in her
   God! Then would she be "clear as the moon, fair as the sun, and
   terrible as an army with banners." If she would expect great things,
   she would see great things. Nations would be born in a day if we
   believed it and myriads would flock, like doves, to their windows if we
   did but look for it, work for it, and bless God for such a measure of
   encouragement as we have. "At evening time it shall be light." Accept
   this as a prophecy. Believe it on the highest warranty. Hope for it
   with the liveliest anticipation. So may ye live to see it. And unto God
   shall be the praise, world without end. Amen.

   *"Reference is made here to a circumstance which caused the English
   public some passing anxiety; but a few days sufficed to disperse the
   cloud, and in a few months it was obliterated from people's memory."

                                Coming to Christ

   A Sermon

   (No. 3509)

   Published on Thursday, April 27th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [17]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's-day Evening, June 17th, 1868.

   "To whom coming."--1 Peter 2:4.

   IN THESE three words you have, first of all, a blessed person
   mentioned, under the pronoun "whom"--"To whom coming." In the way of
   salvation we come alone to Jesus Christ. All comings to baptism,
   comings to confirmation, comings to sacrament are all null and void
   unless we come to Jesus Christ. That which saves the soul is not coming
   to a human priest, nor even attending the assemblies of God's saints;
   it is coming to Jesus Christ, the great exalted Saviour, once slain,
   but now enthroned in glory. You must get to him, or else you have
   virtually nothing upon which your soul can rely. "To whom coming."
   Peter speaks of all the saints as coming to Jesus, coming to him as
   unto a living stone, and being built upon him, and no other foundation
   can any man lay than that which is laid, and if any man say that coming
   anywhere but to Christ can bring salvation, he hath denied the faith
   and utterly departed from it. The coming mentioned in the text is a
   word which is sometimes explained in Scripture by hearing, at other
   times by trusting or believing, and quite as frequently by looking. "To
   whom coming." Coming to Christ does not mean coming with any natural
   motion of the body, for he is in heaven, and we cannot climb up to the
   place where he is; but it is a mental coming, a spiritual coming; it
   is, in one word, a trusting in and upon him. He who believes Jesus
   Christ to be God, and to be the appointed atonement for sin, and relies
   upon him as such, has come to him, and it is this coming which saves
   the soul. Whoever the wide world over has relied upon Jesus Christ, and
   is still relying upon him for the pardon of his iniquities, and for his
   complete salvation, is saved.

   Notice one thing more in these three words, that the participle is in
   the present. "To whom coming," not "To whom having come," though I
   trust many of us have come, but the way of salvation is not to come to
   Christ and then forget it, but to continue coming, to be always coming.
   It is the very spirit of the believer to be always relying upon Christ,
   as much after a life of holiness as when he first commenced that life;
   as much when he has been blessed with much spiritual nearness of access
   to God, and a holy, heavenly frame of mind; as much then, I say, as
   when, a poor trembling penitent, he said, "God, be merciful to me a
   sinner." To Christ we are to be, always coming; upon him always
   relying, to his precious blood always looking.

   So I shall take the text, then, this evening thus:--These three words
   describe our first salvation, describe the life of the Christian, and
   then describe his departure, for what even is that but to be still
   coming to Christ, to be in his embrace for ever? First, then, these
   three words describe, and very accurately too:--

   I. THE FIRST SALVATION OF THE BELIEVER.

   It is coming to Christ. I shall not try to speak the experience of many
   present; I know if it were necessary you could rise and give your "Yea,
   yes" to it. In describing the work of grace at the first, I may say
   that it was indeed a very simple thing for us to come to Christ, but
   simple as it was, some of us were very long in finding it out. The
   simplest thing in all the world is just to look to Jesus and live, to
   drink of the life-giving stream, and find our thirst for ever assuaged.
   But though it is so plain that he who runs may read, and a man needs
   scarce any wit to comprehend the gospel, yet we went hither and
   thither, and searched for years before we discovered the simplicity
   which is in Christ Jesus. Most of us were like Penelope, who spun by
   day, and then unwound her work at night. It was even so we did. We
   thought we were getting up a little. We had some evidence. We said,
   "Yes, we are in a better state; are shall yet be saved." But ere long
   the night of sorrow came in. We had a sight of our own sinfulness, and
   what we had spun, I say, by day, we unwound again quite as quickly by
   night. Well, there are some of you much in the same way now. You are
   like a foolish builder who should build a wall, and then should begin
   to knock down all the stones at once. You build, and then pull down.
   Or, like the gardener who, having put into the ground his seeds and
   planted his flowers, is not satisfied with them, and thinks he will
   have something else, and so tries again. Ah! the methods and the shifts
   we will be at to try and save ourselves, while, after all, Christ has
   done it all. We will do anything rather than be saved by Christ's
   charity. We do not like to bow our necks to take the mercy of God, as
   poor undeserving sinners. Some will attend their church or their chapel
   with wonderful regularity, and think that that will ease their
   conscience, and when they get no ease of conscience from that, then
   they will! try sacraments, and when no salvation comes from them, then
   there will be good works, Popish ceremonies, and I know not what
   besides. All sorts of doings, good, bad, and indifferent, men will take
   to, if they may but have a finger in their own salvation, while all the
   while the blessed Saviour stands by, ready to save them altogether if
   they will but be quiet and take the salvation he has wrought. All
   attempts to save ourselves by our own works are but a base bargaining
   with God for eternal life, but he will never give eternal life at a
   price, nor sell it, for all that man could bring, though in each hand
   he should hold a star; he will give it freely to those who want it. He
   will dispense it without money and without price to all who come and
   ask for it, and, hungering and thirsting, are ready to receive it as
   his free gift, but:--

   "Perish the virtue, as it ought, abhorred,

   And the fool with it, who insults his Lord,"

   by bringing in anything that he can do as a Around of dependence, and
   putting that in the place of the blood and righteousness of the Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   I said, dear friends, that it was very simple, and indeed it is so, a
   very simple thing to trust Jesus and be saved, but it cost some of us
   many a day to find it out. Shall I just mention some of the ways in
   which persons are, long before they find it out. Some ask, "What is the
   best way to act faith? What is the best way to get this precious
   believing that I hear so much spoken of?" Now the question reminds me
   of a madman who, standing at a table which is well spread, says to a
   person standing there, "Tell me what is the best way to eat. What is
   the philosophy of eating?" "Why," the man replies, "I cannot be long
   about that; I need not write a long treatise on it: the best way I know
   of is to eat." And when people say, "What is the best way to get
   faith?" I say, "Believe." "But what is the best way to believe?" Why,
   believe. I can tell you nothing else. Some may say to you, "Pray for
   faith." Well, but how can you pray without faith? Or if they tell you
   to read, or do, or feel, in order to get faith, that is a roundabout
   way. I find not such exhortations as these put down as the gospel, but
   our Master, when he went to heaven, bade us go into all the world and
   preach the gospel to every creature; and what was that gospel to me?
   His own words are, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved,"
   and we cannot say anything clearer than that. "Believe"--that is,
   trust--"and be baptized," and these two things are put before you as
   Christ's ordained way of salvation. Now you want to philosophise, do
   you? Well, but why should a hungry man philosophies about the bread
   that it before him? Eat, sir, and philosophise afterwards. Believe in
   Jesus Christ, and when you get the joy and peace which faith in him
   will be sure to bring, then philosophize as you will.

   But some are asking the question, "How shall I make myself fit to be
   saved?" That is similar to, a man who, being very black and filthy,
   coming home from a coal mine or from a forge, says, seeing the bath
   before him: "How shall I make myself fit to be"? You tell him at once
   that there cannot be any fitness for washing, except filthiness, which
   is the reverse of a fitness. So there can be no fitness for believing
   in Christ, except sinfulness, which is, indeed, the reverse of fitness.
   If you are hungry, you are fit to eat; if you are thirsty, you are fit
   to drink; if you are naked, you are fitted to receive the garments
   which charity is giving to those who need them; if you are a sinner,
   you are fitted for Christ, and Christ for you; if you are guilty, you
   are fitted to be pardoned; if you are lost, you are fitted to be saved.
   This, is all the fitness Christ requireth, and cast every other thought
   of fitness far hence; yea, cast it to the winds. If thou be needy,
   Christ is ready to enrich thee. If thou wilt come and confess thine
   offences before God, the gracious Saviour is willing to pardon thee
   just as thou art. There is no other fitness wanted.

   But then, if you have answered that, some will begin to say, "Yes, but
   the way of salvation is coming to Christ and I am afraid I do not come
   in the right way." Dear, dear, how unwise we are in the matter of
   salvation! We are much more foolish than little children are in common,
   everyday life. A mother says to her little child, "Come here, my dear,
   and I will give you this apple." Now I will tell you what the first
   thought of the child is about; it is about the apple; and the second
   thought off the child is about its mother; and the very last thought he
   has is about the way of coming. His mother told him to come, and he
   does not say, "Well, but I do not know whether I shall come right." He
   totters along as best he can, and that does not seem to occupy his
   thoughts at all. But when you say to a sinner, "Come to Christ, and you
   shall have eternal life," he thinks about nothing but his coming. He
   will not think about eternal life, nor yet about Jesus Christ, to whom
   he is bidden to come, but only about coming, when he need not think of
   that at all, but just do it--do what Jesus bids him--simply trust him."
   "What kind of coming is that," says John Bunyan, "which saves a soul?"
   and he answers, "Any coming in all the world if it does but come to
   Jesus." Some come running; at the very first sermon they hear they
   believe in him. Some come slowly; they are many years before they can
   trust him. Some come creeping; scarcely able to come, they have to be
   helped by others, but as long as they do but come, he has said, "Him
   that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out." You may have came in the
   most awkward way in all the world, as that man did who was let down by
   ropes through the ceiling into the place where Jesus was, but Christ
   rejects no coming sinner, and you need not be looking to your coming,
   but looking to Christ. Look to him as God--he can save you; as the
   bleeding, dying Son of Man--he is willing to save you, and flat before
   his cross, with all your guilt upon you, cast yourself, and believe
   that he will save you. Trust him to do it, and he must save you, for
   that is his own word, and from it he cannot depart. Oh! cease, then,
   that care about the calling, and look to the Saviour.

   We have met with others who have said, "I Well, I understand that, that
   if I trust in Christ, I shall be saved, but--but--but--I do not
   understand that passage in the Revelation: I cannot make out that great
   difficulty in Ezekiel; I am a great deal troubled about predestination
   and free will, and I cannot believe that I shall be saved until I
   comprehend all this." Now, my dear friend, you are altogether on the
   wrong tack. When I was going from Cook's Haven to Heligoland to the
   North of Germany, I noticed when we were out at sea, far away from the
   sight of land, innumerable swarms of butterflies. I wondered whatever
   they could do there, and when I was at Heligoland I noticed that almost
   every wave that came up washed ashore large quantities of poor dead,
   drowned butterflies. Now do you know those butterflies were just like
   you? You want to go out on to the great sea of predestination, free
   will, and I do not know what. Now there is nothing for you there, ant
   you have no more business there than the butterfly has out at sea. It
   will drown you. How much better for you just to come and fly to this
   Rose of Sharon--that is the thing for you. This Lily of the
   Valley--come and light here. There is something here for you, but out
   in that dread-sounding deep, without a bottom or a shore, you will be
   lost, seeking after the knowledge of difficulties, which God has hidden
   from man, and trying to pry into the thick darkness where God conceals
   truth which it were better not to reveal. Come you to Jesus. If you
   must have the knots untied, try to untie them after you get saved, but
   now your first business is with Jesus; your first business is coming
   unto him; for if you do not, your ruin is certain, and your destruction
   will be irretrievable. But I must not enlarge. Coming to Christ is very
   simple, yet how long it takes men to find it out!

   Again, we, bear our witness to-night, that nothing but coming to Christ
   ever did give us any peace. In my own case I was distracted, tossed
   with tempest, and not comforted for some years, and I never could
   believe my sin forgiven or have any peace by day or night until I
   simply trusted Jesus, and from that time my peace has been like a
   river. I have rejoiced in the certainty of pardon, and sung with
   triumph in the Lord my God, and many of you are constantly doing the
   same, but until you looked to Christ, you had not any peace. You
   searched, and searched, and searched, but your search was fruitless
   until you looked into the five wounds of the expiring Saviour, and
   there you found life from the dead.

   And once more, when we did come to Christ, we came very tremblingly,
   but he did not cast us out. We thought he never died for us, that he
   could not wash our sins away. We conceived that we were not of his
   elect; we dreamed that our prayers could only echo upon a brazen sky,
   and never bring us an answer. But still we came to Christ, because we
   dared not stop away. We were like a timid dove that is hunted by a
   hawk, and is afraid. We feared we should be destroyed, but he did not
   say to us, "You came to me tremblingly, and I will reject you." Nay,
   but into the bosom of his love he received us, and blotted out our
   sins. When we came to Jesus, we did not come bringing anything, but we
   came to him for everything. We came strictly empty-handed, and we got
   all we wanted in Christ. There is a piece of iron, and if it were to
   say, "Where am I to get the power from to cling to the loadstone?" the
   loadstone would say, "Let me get near you, and I will supply you with
   that." So we sometimes think, "How can I believe? How can I hope? How
   can I follow Christ?" Ay, but let Christ get near us, and he finds us
   with all that. We do not come to Christ to bring our repentance, but to
   get repentance. We do not come to him with a broken heart, but for a
   broken heart. We do not so much even come to him with faith, as come to
   him for faith.

   "True belief and true repentance,

   Every grace that brings us nigh;

   Without money,

   Come to Jesus Christ, and buy."

   This is the first way of salvation--simply trusting and looking up to
   Christ for everything. But, then, we did trust. There is a difference
   between knowing about trust and trusting. By God's Holy Spirit, we were
   not left merely to talk about faith, nor to think about it, but we did
   believe. If the Government were to announce that there would be ten
   thousand acres of land in New Zealand given to a settler, I can imagine
   two men believing it. One believes it and forgets it; the other
   believes it and takes his passage to go out and get the land. Now the
   first kind of faith saves nobody; but the second faith, the practical
   faith, is that which, for the sake of seeking Christ, gives up the sins
   of this life, the pleasures of it--I mean the wicked pleasures of
   it--gives up all confidence in everything else, and casts itself into
   the arms of the Saviour. There is the sea of divine love; he shall be
   saved who plunges boldly into it, and casts himself upon its waves,
   hoping to be upborne. Oh! my hearer, hast thou done this? If so, thou
   art certainly a saved one. If thou hast not, oh! may grace enable thee
   to do it ere yet that setting sun has hidden himself beneath the
   horizon. Hast thou known this before, that a simple trust in Christ
   will save thee? This is the one message of this inspired Volume. This
   is the gospel according to Paul, the one gospel which we preach
   continually. Try it, and if it save thee not, we will be bondsmen for
   God for thee. But it must save thee, for God is true, and cannot fail,
   and he has declared, "He that believeth on him is not condemned, but he
   that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed
   on the Son of God."

   Thus I have tried to explain as clearly as I can that coming to Jesus
   is the first business of salvation. Now, secondly, and with brevity.
   This is:--

   II. A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE ENTIRE CHRISTIAN LIFE.

   The Christian is always coming to Christ. He does not look upon faith
   as a matter of twenty years ago, and done with, but he comes today and
   he will come to-morrow. He will come to Jesus Christ afresh to-night
   before he goes to bed. We come to Jesus daily, for Christ is like the
   well outside the cottager's house. The man lets down the bucket and
   gets the cooling draught, but he goes again to-morrow, and he will have
   to go again at night if he is to leave a fresh supply. He must
   constantly go to the same place. Fishes do not live in the water they
   were in yesterday; they must be in it to-day. Men do not breathe the
   air which they breathed a week ago; they must have fresh air into the
   lungs moment by moment. Nobody thinks that he can be fed upon the fact
   that he did have a good meal six weeks ago; he has to eat continually.
   So "the just shall live by faith." We come to Jesus just as we came at
   first, and we say to him:--

   "Nothing in my hands I bring,

   Simply to thy cross I cling;

   Naked come to thee for dress,

   Helpless, look to thee for grace;

   Foul, I to the fountain fly,

   Wash me, Saviour, or I die."

   This is the daily and hourly life of the Christian.

   But while we thus come daily, we come more boldly than we used to do.
   At first we came like cringing slaves; now we came as emancipated men.
   At first we came as strangers. Now we come as brethren. We still come
   to the cross, but it is not so much to find pardon for past sins, for
   these are forgiven, as to find fresh comfort from looking up to him who
   wrought out perfect righteousness for us.

   We come, also, to Jesus Christ, more closely than we used to do. I
   hope, brethren and sisters, you can say that you are not at such a
   distance from Christ now as you once were. We ought to be always
   getting nearer to him. The old preachers used to illustrate nearness to
   Christ by the planets. They said there were Jupiter and Saturn far
   away, with very little light and very little heat from the sun, and
   then they have their satellites, their rings, their moons, and their
   belts to make for that. Just so they said, with some Christians. They
   get worldly comforts--their moons, and their belts--but they have not
   got much of their Master; they have got enough to save them, but oh!
   such little light. But, said they, when you get to Mercury, there is a
   planet without moons. Why, the sun is its moon, and, therefore, what
   does it want with moons when it has the full blaze of the sun's light
   and heat continually pouring upon it? And what a nimble planet it is;
   how it spins along in its orbit, because it is near the sun! Oh! to be
   like that--not to be far away from Jesus Christ, even with all the
   comforts of this life, but to be near him, filled with life and sacred
   activity through the abundance of fellowship and communion with him. It
   is still coming, but it is coming after a nearer sort.

   And I may say, too, that it is coming of a dearer sort, for there is
   more love in our coming now than there used to be. We did come at
   first, not so much loving Christ, as venturing to trust him, thinking
   him, perhaps, to be a hard Master; but now we know him to be the best
   of friends, the dearest of husbands. We come to his bosom, and we lean
   our heads upon it. We come in our private devotion; we tell him all our
   troubles; we unburden our hearts, and get his love shed abroad in our
   hearts in return, and we go away with a joy that makes our heart to
   leap within us and to bound like a young roe over the mountain-tops.
   Oh! happy is that man who gets right into the wounds of Jesus, and,
   with Thomas, cries, "My Lord and my God!" This is no, fanaticism, but a
   thing of sober, sound experience with some of us. We can rejoice in
   him, having no confidence in the flesh. It is still coming but it is
   coming after a dearer fashion.

   Yet, mark you, it is coming still to the same person, coming still as
   poor humble ones to Christ. I have often told you, my dear brethren and
   sisters, that when you get a little above the ground, if it is only an
   inch, you get too high. When you begin to think that surely you are a
   saint, and that you have some good thing to trust to, that rotten stuff
   must all be pulled to pieces. Believe me, God will not let his people
   wear a rag of their own spinning; they must be clothed with Christ's
   righteousness from head to foot. The old heathen said he wrapped
   himself up in his integrity, but I should think he did not know what
   holes there were in it, or else he would have looked for something
   better. But we wrap ourselves in the righteousness of Christ, and there
   is not a cherub before the throne that wears a vestment so right royal
   as the poor sinner does when he wears the righteousness of Jesus
   Christ. Oh! child of God, always live upon your Lord. Hang upon him, as
   the pitcher hangs upon the nail. Lean on your Beloved; his arm will
   never weary of you. Stay yourselves upon him; wash in the precious
   fountain always; wear his righteousness continually; and be glad in the
   Lord, and your gladness need never fail while you simply and wholly
   lean upon him. And now, not to detain you longer, I come to the last
   point, upon which we will only say a word or two. The text is:--

   III. A VERY CORRECT DESCRIPTION OF OUR DEPARTURE.

   "To whom coming." We shall soon, very soon, quit this mortal frame. I
   hope you have learned to think of that without any kind of shudder. Can
   you not sing:--

   "Ah! I shall soon be dying,

   Time swiftly glides away;

   But on my Lord relying

   I hail the happy day."

   What is there that we should wait here for? Those who have the most of
   this world's cods have found it paltry stuff. It perishes in the using.
   There is a satiety about it; it cannot satisfy the great heart of an
   immortal man. It is well for us that there is to be an end of this
   life, and especially for us to whom that end is glowing with
   immortality. Well, the hour of death will be to us a coming to Christ,
   a coming to sit upon his throne. Did you ever think of that? "To him
   that overcometh will I give to sit upon my throne." Lord, Lord, we
   would be well content to, sit at thy feet. 'Twere all the heaven we
   would ask if we might but creep behind the door, or stand and be manual
   servants, or sit, like Mordecai, in the king's court.' No; but it must
   not be. We must sit on his throne, and reign with him for ever and
   ever. This is what death will bring you--a glorious participation in
   the royalties of your ascended Lord.

   What is the next thing? "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast
   given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory." So that
   we, are to be going to Christ ere long to behold his glory, and what a
   sight that will be! Have you ever thought of that too? What must it be
   to behold his glory? Some of my brethren think that when they get to
   heaven they shall like to behold some of the works of God in nature and
   so on. I must confess myself more satisfied with the idea that I shall
   behold his glory, the glory of the Crucified, for it seems to me that
   no kind of heaven but that comes up to the description of the Apostle
   when he saith, "Eye hath not seen, nor hath ear heard, neither hath it
   entered into the heart of man to conceive the things which God hath
   prepared for them that love him." But to see the stars, has entered
   into the heart of man, and to behold the works of God in nature, has
   been conceived of; but the joys we speak of are so spiritual that the
   Apostle says, "He has revealed them unto us by his Spirit," and this is
   what he has revealed, "That they may behold my glory." St. Augustine
   used to say there were two sights he would like to have seen--Rome in
   her splendour, and Paul preaching--the last the better sight of the
   two. But there is a third sight for which one might give up all, give
   up seeing Naples, or seeing anything, if we might but see the King his
   beauty. Why, even the distant glimpse which we catch of him through a
   glass or a telescope darkly ravishes the soul. Dr. Hawker was once
   waited upon by a friend, who asked him to go and see a naval review. He
   said, "No, thank you; I do not want to go." "You are a loyal man,
   doctor, and you would like to see the defences of your country." "Thank
   you, I do not wish to go." "But I have got a ticket for you, and you
   must go." "No," he said, "thank you," and after he had been pressed
   hard he said, "You have pressed me till I am ashamed, and now I must
   tell you--mine eyes have seen the King in his beauty, and the land
   which is very far off, and I have not any taste now for all the pomps
   that this world could possibly show." And if such a distant sight of
   Jesus can do this, what must it be to behold his glory with what the
   old Scotch divines used to call "a face-to-face view"; when the veil is
   taken down, when the clouds are blown away, and you see him face to
   face? Oh! long-expected day begin, when we shall be to him coming to
   dwell with him.

   Once more only. Recollect we shall come to Christ not only to behold
   his glory, but to share in it. We shall be like him, for we shall see
   him as he is. Whatever Christ shall be, his people shall be, in
   happiness, riches, and honour, and together they shall take their full
   share. The Church, his bride, shall sit on the same throne with him,
   and of all the splendours of that eternal triumph she will have her
   half, for Christ is no niggard to his imperial spouse, but she whom he
   chose before the world began, and bought with blood, and wrapped in his
   righteousness, and espoused to himself for ever, shall be a full
   partaker of all the gifts that he poses world without end. And this
   shall be, and this shall be, and this shall be for ever; for ever you
   shall be with Christ, for ever coming to him. When the miser's wealth
   has melted; when the honours of the conqueror have been blown away or
   consumed like chaff in the furnace; when sun and moon grow dim with
   age, and the hoary pillars of this earth begin to rock and reel with
   stern decay; when the angel shall have put one foot on the sea and the
   other on the land, and shall have sworn by him that liveth that time
   shall be no more; when the ocean shall be licked up with tongues of
   fire, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth and
   all the works that are therein shall be burnt up--then, then shall you
   be for ever with the Lord, eternally resting, eternally feasting,
   eternally magnifying him; being filled with all his fulness to the
   utmost capacity of your enlarged being, world without end.

   So God grant it to us, that we may come to Christ now, that we may
   continue to come to Christ, that we may come to Christ then, lest
   rejecting him to-night we should be rejecting him for ever; lest
   refusing to trust him, we should be driven from his presence to abide
   in misery for ever! May we come now, for Christ's sake.

                           The Fainting Soul Revived

   A Sermon

   (No. 3510)

   Published on Thursday, May 4th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [18]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord."--Jonah 2:7.

   WHEN man was first made, there was no fear of his forgetting God for it
   was his highest privilege and delight to have communion with his Maker.
   "The Lord God walked in the garden in the cool of the day," and Adam
   was privileged to hold fellowship with God, closer, perhaps, than even
   the angels had in heaven. But the spell of that sacred harmony was
   rudely broken by man's disobedience and his dreadful fall. Ever since
   our first parent tasted of the forbidden fruit, which brought death
   into our world, and all its train of woes, his mortal race has been
   naturally prone to forget God. The evil propensities of flesh and blood
   have made it impossible to persuade man to remember his Creator. The
   complaint of God against the Jews is true as an indictment against the
   whole human family. "Hear, O heaven, and give ear. O earth: I have
   nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me;
   the ox knoweth its owner, and the ass its master's crib, but Israel
   doth not know, my people doth not consider." Man is foolish; he flies
   from the highest good. Man is wicked; he turns his back upon supreme
   holiness. Man is worldly: he forgets the kingdom of God and the world
   to come. Man is wilful; he follows his own vain imaginations, and, with
   head-strong rebellion, opposes himself to his God, that he may pursue
   his own wayward course, and gratify his wanton passions.

   To convince a man of his error, to arrest him in his evil pursuits, to
   reclaim him to the paths of righteousness--this is seldom accomplished
   without dire trouble and deep affliction. Some men, it is true, are
   brought to God by gentle means; they are drawn by soft but mighty
   bonds; still, a much larger class of persons remains, upon whom these
   silken cords would exert no influence. They must not be handled softly,
   but must be dealt with heavily. The picklock will never open their
   hearts; there must be the crowbar, and even the battering ram, to give
   a furious cannonade. Some hearts can never be captured for God and for
   truth except by storm. Sword in hand, God's law must scale the
   ramparts. With thundering report, God's Word must dash down the walls
   of their confidence, and make breach after breach in the bastions of
   their pride, and even then they will fight it out, and never yield,
   until, driven to an awful extremity, they see that they must either
   yield at once, or else be lost for ever. It is with such persons that I
   now particularly want to deal. There are those who have forgotten God
   after having once known him, and they are not likely to be brought back
   without great trouble; and there are others who never did know God, and
   they never will enquire after him, unless they are driven to their
   wits' end by calamity, as when a great famine in the land where he
   dwelt compelled the prodigal for very lack of bread to seek his
   Father's house. So I have first to remonstrate:--

   I. WITH THE BACKSLIDER.

   Let me, however, before I go into the matter with you, describe a
   little more minutely the individuals I wish to address. There is no
   need to call out your names; it will suffice if we portray your
   character and describe your conduct. There are some of you who used to
   be members of Christian churches years ago, but you have gradually
   declined, and so reckless has your career at length become, that it is
   a wonder that you have not utterly perished in your sin. You seemed to
   run well on the outset, and for a time you held on in the way; but
   where are you now? Well, you happen at this present to be in God's
   house, and I do trust that God's own hour has come, when he will meet
   you and bring you back. What we have to say of Jonah, I do entreat you
   to apply to yourselves; if the cap seems to fit you, put it on and wear
   it, even though it should be a fool's cap: wear it till you are ashamed
   of yourselves, and are led to confess your folly before the God who is
   able to remove it, and to make you wise unto salvation.

   Observe, dear friends, that though Jonah remembered the Lord, it was
   not till he got into the whale's belly, nor even then till his soul
   fainted within him. He did not remember the Lord all the time he was
   going down to Joppa to find a ship, nor yet when he got on board that
   ship. His Master had said to him, Jonah, go to Nineveh," but Jonah was
   a strong-willed, head-strong fellow. Though a true servant of God, and
   a prophet, yet he fled from the presence of the Lord. To Nineveh, he
   resolved within himself, he would not go. He could foresee no honour to
   himself out of the journey, no increase of his own reputation, no
   deference that would come to him amongst those proud Assyrians, so, in
   direct defiance of the divine command, he set off to Joppa, to take a
   ship and to flee from God's presence. Into the ship he got, paid the
   fare, and went sallying down the sea to go to Tarshish; but all this
   while he never thought of God. Not unlikely in this assembly there may
   be a woman who used to be a member of a Christian church, but she
   married an ungodly man; after that there was no going to the house of
   God, much less anything like keeping up her church membership. The shop
   was kept open on Sunday, or there was a pleasure party to be
   entertained at home, or an excursion taken into the country. All this
   seemed very pleasant. The disquietude of conscience she might feel at
   first wore off as habit made it familiar, until, year after year, this
   woman, who once seemed to be a true servant of Christ, lives in
   carelessness and indifference, not to say profanity, with hardly any
   thoughts of God. Perhaps she has not quite given up prayer; she could
   not absolutely become an enemy of Christ, or entertain a dislike to his
   people. Still, God was forgotten. So long as the business prospered,
   the husband was in good health, and the world smiled, God was never
   thought of. Can I be mistaken in supposing that there is a man here who
   in his youth was a loud talker, a vehement professor of religion, and a
   companion of those that fear the Lord? But after a time there seemed to
   be a way of getting money rather faster than the ordinary methods of
   honest labour or simple merchandise; so he entered into, a speculation,
   which soon ate out the vitals of his piety. His new projects involved
   new companions; in their fellowship he stifled his old convictions,
   and, as he would not play the hypocrite, he ceased to make any
   profession at all. Perhaps months have passed since he has been in a
   place of worship; even now he would rather be unrecognised, for he has
   only come here because a friend from the country asked him company to
   me the place and to hear the preacher. Ah! my dear sir, it is strange
   indeed, if you be a child of God, that you could have walked so
   contrary to God as you have. Yet so did Jonah. Do I, then, hold up his
   case before your eyes to comfort you? Nay; but let me hope that you
   will apply the bitter rebuke to your own soul, and be led to do as
   Jonah did. All the while the ship sailed smoothly over the sea, Jonah
   forgot his God. You could not have distinguished him from the veriest
   heathen on board. He was just as bad as they were. Yet was there a
   spark of fire among the embers, which God in due time fanned into a
   flame. Happy for you if this better part of his experience should tally
   with your own.

   Such, too, was Jonah's blank forgetfulness, that he does not appear to
   have thought upon his God all the while the storm raged, the billows
   rolled, and the ship was tossed with tempest. The poor heathen sailors
   were all on their knees crying for mercy, but Jonah was asleep in the
   vessel, till the superstitious captain himself was amazed at his
   apathy: "What meanest thou, O sleeper; carest thou not that we all
   perish?" He went down and upbraided him, and asked him how it was that
   he could sleep while the passengers and crew were all crying. "Arise,"
   said he, "and call upon thy God." He was stirred up to his danger and
   his duty, even by a heathen! Now maybe there are some here who have had
   a host of troubles. Is husband dead? Are you a lone woman with a family
   to provide for? Or are you a widower, looking on your children with
   pity, whom you once regarded with a homely pride? Possibly you may have
   another form of trial. Your business has gone to the bad; you expected
   to have realised large profits by it, but you encountered loss upon
   loss, till your little capital has been scattered. Still, all this
   while you have not thought about God. Mayhap that child after child has
   been taken from you, and yet you have not remembered God. Is it really
   so, that the Lord loves you, and, because he loves you, therefore
   chastens you? Mark my word, you will continue to suffer loss upon loss,
   till you have lost all you have and all you count dear, and you will be
   brought to death's door yourself, but he will save you at last. If you
   ever were his, he never will let you sink into hell; but, oh! it will
   be hard work for you to get to heaven. You will be saved, but it will
   be so as by fire. You will be saved as by the skin of your
   teeth--scarcely saved, and the way in which you are saved will be a
   most terrible one to you. Oh! friend, I wish you would turn while God
   is smiting you gently, for know of a certainty if rods will not do, he
   will come to scourges, and if the scourge will not do, he will take the
   knife, and if the knife will not do, he will take the sword, and you
   shall have to feel it, for, as sure as God is God, he will never lose
   his child, and he will cut that child, as it were, into pieces, but he
   will save his soul. He will undermine your constitution by disease, and
   make you toss upon the bed of anguish, but he will bring you back. Oh!
   that you had grace to come back by gentler means before these terrible
   actions are tried!

   So, then, Jonah did not think of God all this time. Now at length the
   vessel begins to creak, and seems as if she must go to pieces. Then
   they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah. He is about to be thrown
   into the sea. At that moment a pair of huge jaws open wide, shut again,
   and swallow him up. "Where am I now?" says Jonah, as he is taken down
   deep by the motions of this monstrous fish, till the weeds come into
   the fish and wrap about his head, and his life is only preserved by a
   miracle. Then, oh! then Jonah thinks upon his God. "When my soul
   fainted within me." Now why did his soul faint within him? Was it not
   because he thought, "Now I am in a hopeless case; I shall never come
   out of this; it is a wonder I am not drowned; it is a marvel I was not
   snapped in pieces by those huge jaws; what a hopeless case I am in! I
   will but linger a little while, then perish I must in this horrible
   prison of a whale's belly." I dare say he thought that never was man in
   such a plight before; never a person that was alive inside a fish; and
   how comfortless he must have felt with nothing but the cold deep round
   him. Instead of garments, weeds were wrapped about his head. How his
   heart throbbed, and his head ached, with no cheer, no light, no
   friendly voice, no succour, no help; faraway from dry land, out on the
   boundless deep, without a comrade to sympathise with his strange
   plight.

   Now when a child of God goes astray, it is not at all unusual for God
   to bring him into just such a state as that, a condition in which he
   cannot help himself; forlorn and friendless, with no one that can
   relieve or minister to him. This dreary thought will meanwhile ever
   haunt his mind, "I brought it all upon myself!" Hast thou not procured
   this unto thyself? Like a woman who has left her husband's house,
   deserted her home, and betrayed her kind and tender protector, what
   fruit can she expect to reap of her wickedness? When she is ready to
   starve, when the wind blows through her tattered raiment, when her face
   is swollen with weeping, and her soul is full of anguish, she has only
   herself to upbraid, as she cries, "I have brought this upon myself;
   would God I had never left my cheerful homestead, however humble the
   lodgings might have been; would God I had never deserted the husband
   who loved me, and spread his aegis over me, however roughly he
   sometimes spake! Oh! that I had been more scrupulously obedient, and
   less prone to discontent!" The afterthought of sin--I think they call
   it remorse. Thus it was that Jonah thought upon his God, when the shame
   of his transgressions overwhelmed him.

   Oh! how merciful our God is to allow us to think about him, and turn to
   him when in so pitiable a plight! "Yes," said a tradesman once to a
   customer for whose favours he felt little cause to be grateful, "you
   come to me, I know why; you have been to every other shop in the town
   for the article you require, and you could not obtain it; and now you
   come back to me whom you had no good cause ever to leave, I shall not
   serve you." This is not how the Lord speaks to us. He does not resent
   our ingratitude. "My child, my poor child," says he, "though you have
   gone and spent your substance; though you have been feeding swine:
   though you are all black, and foul and filthy, yet you are my dear
   child still, and my heart yearns towards you." Without a word of
   rebuke, or even a taunting look, so soon as ever a poor sinner comes
   back to the Father's house, the Father's arms are round about his neck,
   and the kiss of pardon is pressed on his cheek. "I remember thee well,"
   says he; "I have blotted out thy sins like a cloud, and like a thick
   cloud thine iniquities." Now if there be a backslider here--and I know
   there are several--I can only hope that God will bring you into Jonah's
   peril. You shall have no pity from me if he does; I will rather be
   thankful to God that he has brought you there, because I shall know
   then that he has some designs of love towards you. But when you get
   into the regions of despair, do as Jonah did--think upon your God.
   What, do any of you objects? Do you imagine that to think about God
   would make you worse? Well, think that you were once his child, and
   think again that he has found you out, and knows where you are. Jonah
   felt that God knew where he was, because he had sent the fish. God
   knows your whereabouts, my good woman; he knows what quarters you are
   now in, my fellow-sinner. Remember, too, that you are yet alive! what a
   wonder it is that you are still permitted to hear the voice which says,
   "Return, return; oh! backslider, return." God is immutable; he cannot
   change; his covenant is steadfast; he will not alter it. If he has
   loved you once, he loves you now. If I bought you, I will have you.
   Come back to him, then; he is your husband still. Return! return! he is
   your Father still--return! return! But, oh! my hearer, perhaps you have
   no pretensions to be a child of his! Perhaps you may have played the
   hypocrite and made a profession in your own strength. You turned back
   from the company of those who fear the Lord, because you never were
   truly converted. If it be so, let the mercy, which God shows to
   sinners, embolden you to cry to him. And may he break you to pieces now
   with the hammer of his Word. So may he save you, and so shall his
   praise be exceedingly great in your salvation.

   Though I have tried thus to reach the backslider, it is likely enough
   that I have missed my mark, honest as my intention has been. Oh! it
   seems so dreadful that any of you should perish in your sins, who know
   the way of hope! Some of you were candled on the knees of piety. There
   are those now in heaven who look down upon you, and could they weep,
   you might feel their tears dropping on your brow. You know very well
   that time was when the hope of a better world yielded you some kind of
   comfort and joy. You do not think, at any rate, that you were feigning
   piety then, but you did account yourself, a sinner. By the compassion
   of the Most High, by the love of God, I pray you stop! Do not drink the
   cup of devils after having drank the cup of the Lord, and give not that
   soul to damnation which once seemed to bid fair for salvation. Eternal
   life is too rich a prize to trifle with. May the Spirit of God do what
   I cannot. May he send home these things to the persons for whom they
   are intended.

   And now we have, in the second place, to deal with the careless, the
   thoughtless, the profligate--with:--

   II. THOSE WHO NEVER WERE AWAKENED--mora1 or immoral in the world's
   reckoning. Jonah did not remember God till his soul fainted within him;
   and the reckless sinner, as a rule, never does remember God till under
   the stress of law, or the distress of pain and penalty; his soul is
   ready to faint within him. Now I hope some of you will be brought to
   feel this faintness.

   What kind of faintness do persons who are under the saved discipline of
   the Spirit of God generally feel?

   There is faintness of horror at their present condition. I can imagine
   a person lying down on the edge of a cliff and falling asleep. On
   suddenly waking up, having moved during his sleep, he finds himself
   within an inch of the precipice, and looks down and sees, far beneath
   him, the jagged rocks and the boiling sea. How his nerves would quiver
   as he realized his position and his jeopardy! Many a sinner has thus
   opened his eyes to discern his terrible hazard. He has suddenly waked
   up to find that he is on the brink of eternal wrath, standing where an
   angry God is waving a dreadful sword, and certain to plunge it into his
   heart before long. Every unconverted person here is poising over the
   mouth of hell upon a single plank, and that plank is rotten; he is
   hanging over the jaws of perdition by one rope, and the strands of that
   rope are snapping every moment. If a man does but apprehend this and
   feels it, I do not wonder that he faints.

   Faintness, moreover, arises from a dread of horrors yet to come. Who
   can conceive the heart-sinking of those poor passengers on board that
   vessel which so lately foundered in the open sea, at the prospect of
   being swallowed up alive, and sinking they knew not whither! It would
   be no easy thing, one would think, to keep from fainting at a time when
   such a doom was imminent. So when God awakens the soul by the noise of
   the tempest, it looks out and sees the ocean of divine wrath about to
   engulf it. The cries of lost spirits appal it, and it says to itself,
   "I shall soon mingle with those shrieks; my voice will aid the wailings
   of their dolorous company ore long; I shall be driven from his presence
   with a fiery sword at my heels before many hours are over." Then the
   soul faints with alarm at the thought of judgment to come.

   Faint, too, is the soul of the sinner through a sense of weakness. "I
   cannot do anything to avert the catastrophe" seems to be the leading
   idea of a person when he has fainted. Over the awakened sinner there
   comes this sense of weakness. When a sinner does not know himself, he
   thinks that being saved is the easiest thing in the world. He supposes
   that to come to Christ to get peace is a matter that can be done just
   as readily as one snaps his fingers. But when God begins to deal with
   him, he says. "I would believe, but I cannot"; and he cries out, "Oh!
   God, I find that faith is as impossible to me as keeping thy law,
   except thou help me!" Once he thought he could reform himself, and
   become as holy as an angel; but now he can do nothing, and he cries out
   for very faintness, "Oh! God, what a poor, helpless, shiftless creature
   I am!"

   And then there will sometimes come over him faintness of such a kind as
   I must call horrible. Well do I remember when I was in that state! I
   thought I would give up prayer, because it seemed of no use to pray,
   and yet I could not help praying; I must pray, and yet I felt that I
   did not pray. I thought I would not go to hear the gospel any more;
   there was nothing in it for me, and yet there was a fascination about
   the preaching of the gospel that made me go and hear it. I heard that
   Christ was very gracious to sinners but I could not believe that he
   would be gracious to me. Little did it matter whether I heard a promise
   or a threatening. I liked the threatening best. Threatenings appeared
   to me to be just what I deserved, and they provoked some kind of
   emotion in my breast. But when I heard a promise I shuddered with a
   gloomy feeling that it was of no use to me; I felt condemned already.
   The pains of hell got hold upon me, so tortured was my soul with the
   forebodings of an endless doom. I heard, the other day, of a young
   minister becoming an infidel, and I prayed for him. What, think you,
   was the burden of my petition? I prayed that God would make him feel
   the weight of his hand; for I cannot imagine that a man who has once
   felt the weight of God's hand can ever afterwards doubt his being, his
   sovereignty, or his power. Believe me, brethren, there is such an
   unutterable anguish, as a man could not long endure without becoming
   absolutely insane, which God makes some people feel in order to crush
   their love of sin, to purge them of their self-righteousness, and bring
   them to a sense of their dependence on himself. Some men can never be
   brought in any other way. I may be addressing the patients I am
   describing. I sincerely hope I am. You are feeling God's hand. The
   whole weight of it rests upon you, and under it you are crushed, as a
   moth is crushed beneath one's finger. Now I have a message from God for
   you. When Jonah was in your case he remembered his God. Tell me, what
   sayest thou, poor heart--what sayest thou to remembering thy God?

   The case I am going to describe is not exactly that of John Newton, but
   it is from his experience that I gather my picture. There is a young
   man with a very good father, a holy father. As the young man grows up
   he does not like his trade: he cannot bear it, no he says to his
   father, "While I succumb to your government I mean to have my own way;
   other people enjoy themselves, and so will I; and as I cannot do it
   under your roof. I will follow my fancy elsewhere." He goes to sea.
   When he is at sea he discovers that all is not quite to his taste; the
   work he has to do is very different from what he had been accustomed
   to; still, he doesn't flinch. At the first port he reaches he gives
   loose to his passions. "Ah!" says he, "this is a jolly life! This is
   far better than being at home with my father, and being kept tied to my
   mother's apron-strings all my days. I say a merry life is the thing to
   suit me, sir." He goes on board again, and wherever the vessel puts in,
   each port becomes an outlet for his vices. He is a rare boy to swear
   and drink, and when he comes back to England he has no words too bitter
   to utter against religion in general, and against his father's scruples
   of conscience in particular. It so happens that one day there comes on
   a dreadful storm. He has to take a long spell at the pumps, and when
   that is over he must begin to pump again, for the ship is ready to
   founder, and every man must keep hard at it hour after hour. There is a
   driving wind and a heavy tempest. At 1ast they are told that nothing
   can save them; there are breakers ahead, and the vessel will be on
   shore! He lashes himself to the mast and floats about all night, and
   the next day, and the next, with faint hope of life. He has some
   twitches of conscience now; he cannot help thinking of his father and
   mother. However, he is not going to be broken down by a trifle. He has
   a hard heart, and he will not give way yet. He is crashed on shore, and
   finds himself among a barbarous people. He is taken care of by the
   barbarians; they give him food; albeit his meal is scant, and he is
   presently set to work as a slave. His master proves harsh to him, and
   his master's wife especially cruel. He gets but little to eat, and he
   is often beaten. Still, he bears up, and hopes for better days. But,
   half-starved and hard worked, his bodily health and his mental energy
   are reduced to a low degree. No marvel that fever overtakes him. Who
   has he to nurse him? What friend to care for him? The people treat him
   as a dog, and take no notice of him. He can neither stir nor move. In
   vain he pines for a drop of water in the dead of the night; he feels
   that he must die of thirst. He lifts his voice, but there is nobody to
   hear him. To his piteous appeal there is no answer. Then it is he
   thinks, "Oh! God, if I might but get back to my father!" Then it is,
   when he is at the last extremity, that he thinks of home.

   Now what did happen in the case of John Newton will happen, and has
   happened, in the case of many a sinner. He never would come back to
   God, but at last he felt that it was no use trying anywhere else. He
   was driven to utter desperation. In this dilemma his heart said, "Oh!
   that I might find the Lord." Hark, now: I will tell you a tale. A lot
   of sailors were going to sea. When about to start, the owner said,
   "There! I have bought a lifeboat; put it on board." They reply, "No,
   never! We don't believe in lifeboats; they are new-fangled things. We
   do not understand them, and we shall never use one." "Put it on board,
   and let it bide there," says the captain. "Well, captain," says the
   boatswain, "a tom fool of a boat--isn't it? I cannot think what the
   owner meant by putting such a thing as this on board." Old tars, as
   they walk along the deck say to themselves, "Ah! I never saw such a
   thing in all my life as that! Think of old Ben Bolt taking a lifeboat
   with him! Don't believe in such gimcracks!" Presently a stiff breeze
   springs up, it comes to a gale--a hurricane--a perfect tornado! Now let
   down the lifeboat, captain. "No, no, no; nonsense!" Let down the
   lifeboat! No; the other boats are got out, but they are stove in, one
   after another, and capsized. They bring out another; she cannot ride
   out the storm. There she goes, right up on the crest of the waves and
   she has gone over, bottom uppermost. It is all over with them! "What
   shall we do, captain?" "Try the lifeboat, boatswain." Just so; when
   every spar is gone, when every other boat is washed overboard, and when
   the ship is going down, they will take to the lifeboat. So be it. The
   Lord wash all your boats overboard. May it please God to wreck your
   vessel; may he shiver every timber, and make you take to the lifeboat.
   I fear me some of you will never take counsel till you reach the
   crisis. May there come, then, such a storm that you will be driven to
   take to Christ. That done there is no storm you need ever fear. That
   done, let the loudest tempest roar, you are safe; you have Christ in
   the vessel with you. Two or three more words, and I have done. God has
   been pleased to give his dear Son, his only-begotten Son, to die a most
   dreadful death, not for righteous ones, but for sinners. Jesus Christ
   came into the world to seek and to save that which was lost. If you are
   a sinner, you are the sort of person Christ came to save. If you are a
   lost one, you are the sort of man that Jesus Christ came to seek. Let
   your present sorrow comfort you, because it is an indication that you
   are the kind of person that Christ will bless. Let your despair deliver
   you from despair, for when you despair there is hope for you. When you
   can do nothing, God will do everything. When you are empty of your own
   conceits, there is room for Christ to enter your heart. When you are
   stripped, Christ's garments are provided for you. When you are hungry,
   the bread that cometh down from heaven is provided for you. When you
   are thirsty, the water of life is yours. Let this broken-heartedness,
   this terror, this alarm, this faintness, this weakness of yours, only
   lead you to say, "I am such as Christ invited to himself. I will go to
   him, and if I perish, I will perish only there"; and if you trust
   Jesus, you shall never perish, neither shall any pluck you out of his
   hand. May you trust him here and now. Amen.

                               The Battle of Life

   A Sermon

   (No. 3511)

   Published on Thursday, May 11th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [19]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?"--1 Cor. 9:7.

   THIS question occurs in the course of an argument. The Apostle was
   proving that the minister who gives all his time to the preaching of
   the Word is entitled to a maintenance from those people amongst whom he
   labours. He gives divers illustrations, amongst them this--that the
   soldier who devotes himself to the service of his country is not
   expected to find his own equipment and his own rations, but he is
   provided for by his country. And so should it be, he teaches us, in the
   Church of God. The minister set apart to labour wholly in spiritual
   things should have temporal supplied found him. That isle topic,
   however, on which it would be superfluous for me to enlarge. Your
   convictions are so sound, and your practice so consistent, that you do
   not need to be exhorted, much less to be expostulated with on that
   matter.

   But the same question may be asked when we have other morals to point.
   Is it ever expected that men who go on a warfare should pay their own
   charges? There is a warfare in which all of us are engaged. What is
   life but a great battle, lasting from our earliest days until we
   sheathe sword in death? This battle we hope to win, and yet if we
   succeed, it will be a distinct and definite response to the challenge
   before us, "Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges?" We may be
   quite sure that if ever we attempt the warfare of life at our own
   expense we shall soon find ourselves failing, and it will end in a
   miserable defeat. Going at once to the subject, we have here:--

   I. AN INSPIRIRING METAPHOR.

   When life is represented as a warfare, some peaceful minds may feel a
   little alarmed at the pictures; yet there are other minds with enough
   of gallantry in their constitutions to feel their blood pulsing the
   stronger at the thought that life is to be one continued contest. I do
   but borrow a reflection from the secular press when I say that it were
   ill for us if the love of peace, fostered among us as a nation, should
   degenerate into a fear of danger, a reluctance to bear hardships, or an
   indifference to the accomplishment of exploits. Craven spirits we may
   expect always to find, who conjure up gloomy anticipations, and to
   forbade horrible disasters. The untrodden path and the unaccustomed
   climate are dreadful bugbears. But is this the instinct of an
   Englishman? How else should he contemplate difficulties but as problems
   to be solved? capital out of which fame or fortune is to be won? And as
   for the British soldier, is he to be looked upon as a hot-house plant,
   who shrinks from exposure? Far rather would I respect him as a
   representative individual, the type of his race, always ready for any
   emergency. In the days of the old Gallic wars, when we had to fight
   with Napoleon in Egypt, there were just as many knotty points and
   critical situations to be grappled with; and certainly at headquarters
   the War Department was not more efficiently managed than it is now. Yet
   British soldiers pressed forward then to the conflict nor did they pant
   for fortune, what they did seek was a career, with some opportunity of
   distinguishing themselves. Moreover, those who stayed at home scanned
   the despatches with eager interest, and full often lamented that they
   had not the chance given them of going forth to the fight. Well may the
   patriot ask, Has Anglo-Saxon courage all fled? if at every call to
   fresh deeds of heroism we listen to the crowing of those whose nature
   it is to look black, and utter dark portents. Our children's children
   may read how the haughty insolence of Theodore of Abyssinia was
   humbled, but I hope they will never hear the screeching of the ravens
   who warned us of the mountain fastnesses in which he was lodged. The
   Ashantee war is behind us now, and I suppose those who were once afraid
   of its perils are now amazed at its prowess. Yes, and that is how I
   would have Christians feel with regard to spiritual conflicts.
   Difficulties! well, they are things to be deciphered. Dangers! they are
   things to be met and encountered. Impossibilities! they are to be
   scouted as a nightmare, a delirious dream. The Christian wakes to find
   impossibility impossible. With a history behind him and a destiny
   before him, he can say, "The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth." Things that
   are impossible with man are possible with God. I like my text all the
   better, because it implies a hostile engagement, and speaks of warfare.
   For me the battlefield has no charms. With host encountering host, and
   carnage left behind, I have no sympathy, but spiritually my soul seems
   enamoured of the idea; I buckle on my armour at the very thought that
   life is to be a conflict and a strife, in which it behaves me to get
   the mastery.

   Do I not address many young men just commencing life? If you have
   thought of life at all I hope you have thought that it is wise to begin
   the battle of life early. We have all so little time to live, and the
   first years of life are so evidently the best years we shall ever have,
   that it is a pity to waste them. Oh! how much more some of us might
   have done if we had begun betimes! Had the very flush of our boyhood
   been consecrated and the strength of our youth spent in our Master's
   service, what work we might have accomplished! Now, young men, as a
   comrade a little farther on the road than you, I take you to the brow
   of the hill for a moment, and point out to you the pathway we have to
   pursue, and as I point it out I tell you that you will have to fight
   along every inch of the road, if you are at the end to win the crown
   which I hope your ambition pants after. Are you ready for the conflict?
   Then let us talk awhile about it, for as we shall always have to be on
   the alert, it is well for us to study the map, and to acquaint
   ourselves with the tactics we must practice.

   Be sure, then, my friend, that if you and, I are ever to be conquerors
   at the last, we shall have to, fight with that trinity of enemies--the
   world, the flesh, and the devil. There is the world. Do you resolve to
   do the right and to love the true, depend upon it you will get no
   assistance from this world. Of its maxims, nine out of ten are false,
   and the other one selfish; and even that which is selfish has a lie at
   the bottom of it. As for its customs--well, live where you may, the
   customs of the world are not such as a citizen of heaven can endorse.
   Go into what company you please, and you will find that there is much
   of the prevailing habit that is no friend to grace, and no friend to
   virtue. In the upper circles, with much presence, there is little
   reality; there is a lack of sound honesty. Amongst the lower classes,
   go where you will, if you firmly resolve to be a Christian, to follow
   closely the footsteps of your Lord, you will have to breast the
   current. The most of men are going, down the hill. You will be like the
   solitary traveller when you are threading your way upwards. Do you
   enlist for Christ to-night? Then know that you enlist against the whole
   world. You will henceforth be an alien to your mother's children, and a
   stranger to your own household, unless happily that household Should
   have been converted too. Young man, the young men in the shop will be
   against you. Alas, for the wickedness of the young men of London! Young
   woman, you will find in the workroom, aye perhaps you will find even in
   your father's house, influences at work to impede, if not to thrust you
   back. Man of business, when you meet others on exchange, if perchance
   the conversation should turn upon religion, you will find it far from
   profitable, and far from genial. You will be like a speckled bird, and
   all the birds round about you will be against you. As a marked man,
   your motives will be mistrusted, your character impugned, your piety
   burlesqued. If you resolve to win the grown of immortality, you will
   only do it as by the skin of your teeth. It matters not where you are
   cast, this is sure to be your lot, unless, as here and there is the
   case, you may be a timid and shielded one, too weak for conflict and,
   therefore, God keeps you in retirement. And yet as for the world, I
   think we could easily overcome that were it not for a worse enemy.

   Soldier of Christ, you have to struggle with yourself. My own
   experience is a daily struggle with myself. I wish I could find in me
   something friendly to grace, but hitherto I have searched my nature
   through, and have found everything in rebellion against God. At one
   time there comes the torpor of sloth, when one ought to be active every
   moment, having so much to do for God, and for the souls of men, and so
   little time to do it in. At another time there comes the quickness of
   passion. When we would be calm and cool, and play the Christian,
   bearing with patience, there come the unadvised word and the rash
   expression. Anon, we are troubled with conceit, the devilish whisper--I
   can call it no less--"How well thou hast done! How well host thou
   played thy part!" This pride is the arch-enemy of our souls. Then will
   come distrust foul and faithless, suggesting that God does not regard
   the affairs of men, and will not interpose on our behalf. Fresh forms
   of evil are generated in our own breasts, and this chameleon heart of
   ours, which never seems of one colour but for a single moment, which is
   this and that by turns, and nothing long, challenges us on all
   occasions, and against it we shall have perpetually to struggle. Unless
   we deny ourselves and lay violent hands upon the impulses of our
   nature, are shall never come to the place where the crowns are
   distributed to the conquerors.

   And then another foe comes up, though not the closest, the strongest of
   the three--the devil! If you have ever stood foot to foot with him, as
   some of us have, you will remember well that blandly day, for even he
   who beats Apollyon concludes the battle wounded in his own hand and in
   his own foot. Oh! that stern enemy! He knows how to attack us in our
   sore points. He discerns our weaknesses and he is at no loss for
   cunning devices. He understands how one moment to fawn upon us and
   flatter us, and how the next moment to cast his fiery darts, telling us
   that we are castaways, and shall never see the face of God with
   acceptance. He can quote Scripture for his purpose. He can hurl
   threatenings at the heads of the saints, which were only meant for
   sinners, and he can tear promises out of the saints' hands, and cast
   them in the mire, just when they are ready to feed upon them as fair
   fruits of Paradise. Believe me, it is no small thing to have had to
   fight with Apollyon, the Prince of Hell. Seest thou then, young
   soldier, what is before thee? There is a triple host of foes, and thou
   must overcome them all, or else there shall never be given to thee the
   white stone, and the crown of everlasting life.

   Think not that this is an engagement to be quickly terminated. Unlike
   the laconic despatch of the ancient Roman, "Veni, vidi, vici," I came,
   saw, and conquered, this is a continuous fight. Wouldest thou fight thy
   way to heaven, not to-day, nor to-morrow; wilt thou win it with a
   deadly skirmish or a brilliant dash like a knight at a tournament, thou
   canst not come back a conqueror. In sober truth, every man and every
   woman who enlists for Christ will have to wrestle till their bones
   shall sleep in the tomb. There shall be no pause nor cessation for thee
   from this day until the laurel is upon thy brow. If thou art defeated
   one day, thou must overcome the next; if a conqueror to-day, thou must
   fight to-morrow. Like the old knights who, slept in their armour, you
   must be prepared for reprisals--always watchful, always expecting
   temptation, and ready to resist it; never saying, "It is enough," for
   he who saith, "It is finished," until he breathes his last has not yet
   truly begun. We must have our swords drawn, even to the very last. I
   have sometimes thought that could we enter heaven by one sharp, quick,
   terrible encounter, such as the martyrs faced at the stake we might
   endure it heroically; but day after day of protracted martyrdom, and
   year after year of the wear and tear of pilgrimage and soldier-life is
   the more bitter trial of patience. I do but tell you in order that you
   may be convinced that it is not in our power to fight this warfare at
   our own charge; that if we have to endure in our own strength and with
   our own resources, it is most certain that disaster will befall us, and
   defeat will humble us. To fight, and fight on, is our vocation. But if
   thus you fight, you may hope to conquer, for others have done so before
   you. On the summit of the palace see you not those robed in white, who
   walk in light, with faces bright, and sparkling o'er with joy? Can you
   not hear their song? They have overcome, and they tell you:--

   "To him that overcometh

   A crown of life shall be;

   He with his Lord and Master

   Shall reign eternally."

   They have overcome; then why should not you, Jesus Christ, who is bone
   of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, has passed through the sternest
   part of the battle, and he has overcome--a type and representative of
   all those who are cross-bearers, and who shall overcome as he has done.

   Do I see some young man, eager, earnest, all of a glow, ready for the
   crown? Let me remind thee that thou mayest be defeated. Though it is
   well for thee to begin life with a resolute determination to fight
   through the battle, still I would have thee remember that thou mayest
   be led captive by thy foe. There is a most instructive little book,
   issued by the Religious Tract Society, called The Mirage of life, which
   I think all young men should read. It gives historical pictures of the
   different ways in which men have sought to be great, wherein the result
   of the greatness attained has proved to be in mirage, mocking the man,
   as the mirage in the desert mocks the traveller when it promises him
   water, and he finds none. That book contains the history of such men as
   Beckford, a man worth £200,000 a year, who spent the former part of his
   life in building Fonthill Abbey, with an enormous tower, enriching the
   place with all the treasures that he could rather from every country;
   making the grounds so splendid that crowned heads longed to look
   within, but, it is said, were refused; and at the end of his life you
   find him almost penniless--the house upon which he had spent all his
   time and money a dilapidated ruin, the tower fallen to the ground, and
   the name of Beckford forgotten. You have a sketch of William Pitt, the
   heaven-born minister. One of the greatest of statesmen, who could make
   war or peace at his will, and after years of the most brilliant success
   he dies with a broken heart through grief. The high ambition of men of
   art such as Haydon, is introduced to your notice. This great painter,
   after blazing with wondrous fame in his art, took away his life because
   he found himself a disappointed and forgotten man. As I read a series
   of such cases, each one seemed sadder than the other, and it was enough
   to make a man sit down and weep to think that our mortal race should be
   doomed to follow such phantoms, and to be mocked by such delusions. As
   I read them all I could not help feeling how necessary it was to say to
   young men, especially just as they are beginning life, and to young
   women too--aye, and the lesson is profitable for all of us--Take care
   how ye run in the race, lest after running, till ye think ye have won
   the prize, ye find that in truth ye have lost it. We must take care how
   we live, for this is the only lifetime we shall have in which to settle
   the life that lasts for ever. Make bankruptcy in your secular business;
   why, you can start again; but once make bankruptcy in soul affairs, and
   there is no second life in which to start your career afresh. Are you a
   defeated soldier of life? Ah! then, you can never begin again, or turn
   the defeat into a victory. If you go down to your grave a captive of
   sin, the iron bands will be about you for ever. There is no retrieving
   your position. The priceless boon of freedom is beyond your reach. You
   may lament, you cannot attain it. See then, our life is a battle; we
   must constantly fight; haply we may win, or haply we may be defeated. I
   now proceed to mark a second point with:--

   II. A KINDLY HINT.

   Like a cool breath fanning our cheeks when too hot with ambition, this
   enquiry greets us, "Who goeth a warfare at any time at his own
   charges?" So, then, charges there will be in this life-battle. It is
   not to be won without pain and cost. Let us just glance at some of
   these charges. You will soon see how they mount up. If any man shall
   get up to heaven what a demand for courage he will have to meet! How
   many enemies he must face! How much ridicule he must endure! How
   frequently must he be misrepresented and maligned! How often must he be
   discreet enough to be silent, and anon, bold enough to speak and avow
   his convictions and his purpose!

   If a man shall get to heaven, what a charge of patience he will be at!
   How he must bear and forbear! How he must put up with one sharp
   difficulty and another, making light of fatigue and fasting, restless
   days and sleepless nights; in fiery temptation unflinching, amidst cold
   contempt unabashed.

   If any man will get to heaven, what an amount of perseverance he will
   require to hold on and to hold out! What hours of prayer, what
   wrestling with God for a blessing, what striving with himself to
   overcome sinful propensities! What a charge of watchfulness he will be
   at! How he must guard the avenues of his being! How he must track his
   actions to the springs of motives, and keep his thoughts pure from
   guile! There can be little ease and not much slumber for a man who
   would get the eternal crown. What fresh supplies of zeal he will need;
   for we shall not drift into heaven without a conflict or a care. We
   must cut, and hack and hew with intense energy, for the Saviour says,
   "The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by
   storm." What strength he will require, for he has to deal with potent
   foes! And oh! what a charge of wisdom he will be put to the expense of,
   for he has to stand against the craftiness of evil creatures, and to
   overcome one who is wiser than the ancients, even Satan, the
   arch-tempter.

   It is possible that the difficulties of an expedition may be intensely
   aggravated by a lack of knowledge as to the country to be invaded.
   Under such circumstances it is hard to anticipate the contingencies
   that may arise. In the battle of life this is the rub. Who knows what
   lies next before him? How can we forestal the surprises that may await
   us? "Boast not thyself of to-morrow, for thou knowest not what a day
   may bring forth." If I were aware of the temptations that would befall
   me a year hence, I think I could guard myself against them, but I do
   not even know what pinch or peril may befall me before the hour has
   passed. You cannot tell the provocations that to-night may occur before
   you close your eyes in slumber. You may have a trial or a temptation
   such as never crossed your path before. Hence I beseech you to consider
   the greatness of the charge of this warfare. You have to pass through
   an experience which no man before you has proved. All the path of life
   is new to you, unmapped, untrodden, unanticipated. Yet all you lack of
   clear statistics is made up for in dire prognostics. No doubt the
   climate is baneful, and will subject you to fever or ague. Our British
   soldiers, rank and file, must press forward though they are landed on a
   blazing beach, across which they have, to march; nor will it ever do
   for them to be dismayed by steep mountains, dismal swamps, or savage
   tribes. Bent on victory, they brave the incidents of the campaign
   before they sight the adversaries they attack, while their heads and
   hearts ace full of honour, promotion, stars, stripes, and Victoria
   crosses. But in our eventful battle of life the checks and bars to
   progress, the dangers and temptations that we shall all have to meet
   with in our natural constitution and our secular calling, the
   unnavigable currents and the impassable barriers that thwart us before
   we grapple with the main enterprise to enter heaven, are more than I
   can describe in one sermon. No marvel to me that Mr. Pliable should
   say, as he turned back, "You may have the, brave country yourselves for
   me." The Slough of Despond, as a first part, put him into a dudgeon and
   he said, "I do not like it; I will have no more of it."

   Apart from divine strength, Pliable was a wise man, wise in his
   generation, to shrink from the adventure, for it is a hard journey to
   the skies. They spake the truth who said that there were giants, to
   fight with, dragons to be slain, mountains to be crossed, and black
   rivers to be forded. It is so, and I pray you count the cost. There is
   no "royal road" to heaven, except that the King's highway leads there.
   There is no easy road skilfully levelled or scientifically macadamised.
   The labour is too exhaustive, the obstructions are too numerous, the
   difficulties are too serious, unless God himself come to our help. I
   wittingly put these dilemmas before you that I may constrain you to
   say, "Who can go this warfare at his own Charges?" And now, in the
   third place, let us look at our text as:--

   III. A GRACIOUS REMINDER.

   Does any man at any time go a warfare at his own charge? I trow not.
   Young man! I have told you of difficulties and of dangers. I trust your
   bold spirit taught by God, has thereby been fired to greater ardour.
   Now I have somewhat to say unto thee which has cheered me, and cheered
   thy sires before me, and made them strong, even in their weakness. It
   is this. You see you cannot go this warfare in your own strength. Is
   not that clear to you? Then, I pray you, do not try it. Do not for a
   moment contemplate it. If you do, you will rue it. Your fall will be
   your first warning; the second time it will warn you more bitterly; if
   you continue in your own strength, you will, perhaps, have a warning
   too late. But you may rely on God to help you. The text implies it. If,
   by faith, you yield yourself to Christ, whoever you may be, with a
   desire and intent to live henceforth as a follower of Jesus, God will
   help you, and that right early. Though a warfare is before you, you are
   not to go at your own charges. Shall I tell you how God will help you?
   Certainly you may reckon upon his watchful Providence. You little know
   how easy the Almighty can make a path which otherwise would haven
   difficult and dangerous. Follow God's leading, and you shall never lack
   for his comfort. I have lived long enough to see many people carve for
   themselves very eagerly, and cut their fingers very severely. I have
   seen others who albeit they were great losers for a time by doing
   right, have had to bless God year after year for the abundant
   recompense they received afterwards. No man shall be a loser in the
   long run by loving and serving God. If thou be willing and obedient,
   trusting thyself with Christ, thou shalt find those awful wheels of
   Providence revolve for thy welfare. The beasts of the field shall be in
   league with thee, and the stones of the field shall be at peace with
   thee. All things shall work together for good to them that love God.
   Now I am not pretending that piety will procure wealth, or that if you
   espouse Christ's cause you shall grow rich. I should not wonder if you
   did. You are none the less likely to prosper in business for being a
   Christian. I am not going to, predict that you shall be without
   sickness, much less without temptation, for "whom the Lord loveth he
   chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth", but sure I am
   of this, that if you put your trust in God and do right, no temporal
   circumstances shall ever happen to you which shall not be for your
   eternal good. This is forestalling much more than any transient
   benefit. In the short space you are to live here you may reckon upon
   the gigantic wheels of Providence as your helpers. The angels or God
   shall be swift to defend you. Your eyes shall not see them, but your
   heart shall wax confident. You shall perceive that by some means you
   have been rescued from a place of drought and led into a fruitful land.

   More than this; as you go this warfare, looking to God to bear your
   charges, you shall have the Lord Jesus Christ to help you. Promise not
   yourself that you will be able to maintain henceforth a perfect life.
   Sin will harass you. Old corruptions, even when they are driven out
   from the throne (for sin shall not reign over you), will yet struggle
   at the foot thereof. But Jesus Christ will be your helper. He will be
   always present to revive you with his precious blood, to sprinkle your
   hearts from an evil conscience, to wash your bodies with pure water.
   Have you never admired that picture of Christ, with the basin and the
   towel washing his disciples' feet? This is what he will ever do for you
   at every eventide when you have defiled yourself through inadvertence
   or infirmity. Look into the face of the Crucified. Perhaps you have
   sometimes wished that he were now visible, and in body accessible to
   you. That sympathizing One who has suffered so much for you! You have
   said, "Oh! that I might go and tell him my griefs, and get his help!"
   He is alive. He is here. He is not far from any one that seeketh him.
   Whosoever trusteth shall surely find Christ to be his very present help
   in time of trouble. Believe this, and thou shalt prove it true.

   And he that is a soldier of the cross shall have the divine power Of
   God the Blessed Spirit to help him. I have sometimes thought, when some
   strong passion has been raging within my soul--How can I ever overcome
   it? The will was good, but the flesh was weak. But as soon as the
   Spirit of God has moved on me the flesh has given way. The Holy Ghost
   can give the man that is prone to idleness such an intense apprehension
   of the value of time that he shall be more industrious than the
   naturally active man. I believe that if any of you who are subject to a
   bad temper will lay this besetting sin before God in prayer, and ask
   the Holy Spirit's help, you shall not only be able to curb it, but you
   will acquire a sweeter and gentler spirit than some of those whose
   temperament is naturally even, with no propensity to fitful change or
   sudden storm. Do not tell me that there is anything in human nature too
   obdurate for the Lord to overcome, for there is not. Whatever may be
   your temptation, you need not account it an effectual hindrance to your
   being a Christian. What though it be beyond your own power to grapple
   with it! When the Eternal arm comes to the rescue; when the right hand
   of Jehovah is made bare; when the Holy Spirit puts forth his
   irresistible power, he can smite through the loins of our kingly sins,
   and cut the Rahabs and dragons of our iniquities in pieces. Rest thou
   in the might of Jehovah, the God of Israel. He that brake Egypt in
   pieces with his plagues can vanquish our sins with his judgments or
   with his grace, and he can bring the new nature, like the children of
   Israel, up out of bondage into joyous liberty. Go thou to the blood,
   and thou shalt conquer sin. Go to the Eternal Spirit, and thy worst
   corruptions shall be overthrown. "Who goeth a warfare any time at his
   own charges?" As the soldier draws from his paymaster, so let every
   Christian draw from his God and Saviour. Conduct your warfare trusting
   in the blessed God. My last words shall be to those who are beginning
   the great battle of life. Let me urge upon them these:--

   IV. CAUTIONS AND COUNSELS.

   Behold the wisdom of diffidence. I heard some time ago of a minister
   preaching on the dignity of self-reliance; and I thought to myself,
   Surely that is the dignity of a fool! The dignity of self-reliance!
   Taken in a certain sense, there is some kind of truth about it; or at
   least the folly of asking counsel of your neighbour in every strait is
   sufficiently obvious. But he that relies on his own wits will soon
   pander to expediency and grovel in the mire. His actions will admit of
   no better defense than excuses and apologies. Nay, sirs; "but let him
   that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." A better subject,
   and one that no preacher need be ashamed of if the Master should come
   ere the sermon be done, is the dignity of reliance upon God, and the
   wisdom of diffidence of oneself. Begin life, young man, by finding out
   that the capital you thought you had, is much less than it looked
   before you counted it. Begin life, young man, by understanding that all
   in your nature that glitters is not gold, and that your strength is
   perfect weakness. Begin by being emptied, and you will soon be filled.
   Blessed are the poor in spirit." Begin by being poor. If you begin with
   lowliness, you will not need to be humiliated.

   "He that is down need fear no fall,

   He that is low no pride;

   He that is humble ever shall

   Have God to be his guide."

   He will win the battle who knows how to begin on the low ground and to
   fight uphill by divine strength. Learn the wisdom, not of
   self-reliance, but of self-diffidence, for he that trusteth in his own
   heart is a fool.

   Be thoroughly alive to the importance of prayer. If all our charges in
   the life-war are to be paid us by the Paymaster, let us go to the
   treasury. Amongst the strangest of human sins is a distaste for prayer.
   I open my eyes with wonder at myself whenever I find my own self slow
   to pray! Why, if your children want anything of you, they are not slow
   to speak. They need not be exhorted to ask for this or that; they speak
   at once. And here is the soul-enriching exercise of prayer. Is it not
   strange that you and I should be slack in it? Did you ever stand in a
   market and see the people coming in from the country with their goods?
   How diligent they are in their business; how eager to take home as much
   money as they can! How their eyes glitter; how sharp they are! But here
   is heaven's market; God's wares are given away to them that will ask
   for them. Yet we seem indifferent, as though we did not care to be
   enriched; we even leave the mercy-seat of God unvisited! Oh! young
   people, do understand the value of prayer; and you aged people, do
   continue in prayer and supplication; for if we are to win this battle
   of our life, it can only be by taking in our charge-bill to the great
   Paymaster, and asking him to discharge the charges of this war.

   Consider, too, the necessity of holiness. If, in my life's warfare, I
   am entirely dependent upon God, let me not grieve him. Let me seek so
   to walk with him that I may expect to have him with me. Oh! let our
   consecration be unreserved and complete.

   And in all these we must prove the power of faith. If we have never
   begun to trust in Jesus, let us begin now. Oh! may the Eternal Spirit
   breathe faith into our souls. The beginning of true spiritual life is
   here--trusting what Christ has wrought for us, relying upon his
   sufferings on our behalf. The continuation of spiritual life is
   here--trusting still in what Christ has done and is doing. The
   consummation of spiritual life on earth is still the same--trusting
   still, trusting ever; always repairing to Christ for the supply of all
   our needs; going to him with our blots to have them removed, with our
   failings to have them forgiven, with our wants and requirements to have
   them provided for, with our good works and our prayers to have them
   rendered acceptable, and with ourselves that we may still be preserved
   in him.

   Sharpen your swords, soldiers of the cross, and be ready for the fray,
   but as ye march to the battle let it be with heads bowed down in
   adoration before him, who alone can cover your heads in the day of
   battle; and when you lift up those heads in the front of the foe, let
   this be your song, "The Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; the
   Lord has become my salvation!" And when the fight waxes hot, if your
   head grow weary, think of "him who endured such contradiction of
   sinners against himself," and still fight on until you win the day, and
   then as the fight draws to a close, and your sun is going down, and you
   can count your scars, and are ready to enter into your rest, be this
   your prayer "I have gone astray like a lost sheep, but seek thy
   servant, for I do not forget thy commandments." And be this your last
   word on earth, "Into thy hand I commit my spirit, for thou best
   redeemed me, O Lord God of my salvation"; so shall this be your eternal
   song in heaven above, "Unto him that hath loved us, and washed us from
   our sins in his own blood, to him be glory for ever and ever. Amen."

                                Are You Mocked?

   A Sermon

   (No. 3512)

   Published on Thursday, May 18th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [20]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   ON Lord's-day Evening, September 17th, 1871.

   "Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his
   refuge."--Psalm 14:6.

   GOD'S Word divides the whole human race into two portions. There is the
   seed of the serpent, and the seed of the woman--the children of God,
   and the children of the devil--those who are by nature still what they
   always were, and those who have been begotten again unto a lively hope
   by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. There are many
   distinctions among men, but they are not much more than surface-deep.
   This one distinction, however, goes right through, and it is very deep.
   I may say that between the two classes, the saved and the unsaved,
   there is a great gulf fixed. There is as wide a difference between the
   righteous and the wicked as there is between the living and the dead.
   The Psalmist, David, in this particular Psalm calls one class of men
   fools, and another class the poor. You will observe that he begins by
   describing the fool, by which he does not mean one particular man. but
   the whole race as it is by nature--the whole of that portion of the
   human race that remains unregenerate. In our text he describes another
   class as the poor, in which he comprehends all the saved, all the
   godly, all the righteous, of whom our Redeemer hath said, "Blessed are
   the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Now from the
   very first, between the two seeds there has always been an enmity--an
   enmity which has never been mitigated, and never will. It displays
   itself in various ways, but it is always there. In some ages the enmity
   has burst forth into open persecution--Herod has sought the young child
   to destroy it; Haman has sought to destroy the whole generation of
   Israel; stakes have been erected, and the faithful have been burnt;
   racks and inhuman engines of cruelty have been fashioned by the art of
   man, through the malice of his heart, to exterminate, if it were
   possible, the children of the living God. For there is war--perpetually
   war to the knife--war ever between the two generations. At this
   particular time the warfare is not less bitter; but the restraints of
   Providence do not allow it to display itself as it once did, and it now
   generally takes the form of cruel mockings so that our text is as
   applicable to the present race as it was in David's time, "Ye have
   shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge." The
   fool bath made a mock of the righteous man, called the poor man; and
   this has been the subject of his mockery, that the godly man has been
   fool enough as he calls him, to put his trust in God, and to make this
   the main point and purpose of his life. There may be some here who have
   done this; all of us do it to some extent until we are new-born. We
   ridicule, if not with the tongue, yet in our heart, those who have made
   God their refuge, for when we begin to value the people of God, it is a
   sign of some degree of grace in us: "We know that we have passed from
   death unto life, because we love the brethren"; but until we come into
   that state of grace there is a hatred or contempt, more or less
   developed, against those who are resting in the living God.

   Now I shall at this time first of all speak of those who are mocked;
   secondly, of the mockers; and thirdly, of how those who are mocked
   might to behave towards those who try to put them to shame. First,
   then, let us take the subject--the object--of the mockery of carnal
   minds.

   I. WHO ARE MOCKED.

   Here we have three points: "Ye have shamed the poor," that is, the
   persons; "the counsel of the poor," that is the reasons of their faith;
   then their faith itself, "because the Lord is his refuge."

   To begin, it is very common for ungodly men to pour contempt upon God's
   people, the poor; and oftentimes they will do it by the use of these
   words. It so happens that many of God's people are poor in pocket, and
   how often do hear the observation, "Oh! these Methodists, these
   Presbyterians, these Baptists, they are a set of poor people,
   mechanics, and servant-girls and so on," and how often is that uttered
   with a sneer upon the lips! Well now, that is a fine thing to make fun
   of, isn't it, for, after all, what is there to be ashamed of in honest
   poverty? I will stand here and say that if I could stand to-morrow
   morning in Cheapside, and pick out a dozen poor men, and then if I were
   to pick out a dozen middle-class men, and then if I were to pick out a
   dozen rich men, I believe, as to character, they would be very much of
   a muchness. You shall go, if you will, and pick out at random twelve
   good princes, and see if you could do it; but I will pick you out
   twelve working men that shall be honest, and upright, and chaste--which
   great men are not always. The poor are no worse than the rich, and have
   no more right to be despised. And if it were true that all who fear God
   were poor, it might, perhaps, be rather to their credit than to their
   dishonour, for, at any rate, nobody would be able to say that their
   Dockets were lined with the result of fraud. If they were poor, they
   would, at any rate, be free from many of the accusations that might be
   brought against rich men. I care no more for one class than another,
   especially when I preach the gospel--you are all alike to me, one as
   the other--but this I will say, that of all jests and all sneers that
   is one of the most ridiculous and mean against godly people, because
   they are poor.

   But the sneer then takes another form. It is not that they are poor in
   pocket, so much as that they are very poor in education. "Ah!" say
   they, "these people--well, what do they know? They are not
   philosophical; they are not amongst those who cultivate the higher
   walks of literature; they are mostly plain, simple-minded people, and,
   therefore, they believe their Bibles." Well, I don't believe that.
   Amongst Christian people there are many men of as high an education as
   among any class. The mind of Newton found root in Scripture, and
   discovered depths which it could not fathom. But even if you say that,
   what of it? If these men have the wisdom which cometh from above, they
   have something that will last when the wisdom which is merely of this
   earth will have perished. Go, take the skull of the wise man in your
   hand, and look at it. Is it not as brown, is it not as ghastly a sight
   as the skul1 of the peasant? And what matters it to him, now that he
   lies among the clods of the valley, that once he spent his nights, with
   the lamp, poring into ancient tomes, or walked with his staff to heaven
   to measure the distance of the stars, or bored into the depths of the
   earth? It in all one to him, and if he is a lost soul, ah! who would
   not give the preference to the man that was learned in the kingdom of
   heaven beyond the man that was only learned in the things of earth? I
   see no great reason for jest on the subject therefore. And the sneer
   is, to say the least, ungenerous; for if the ungodly be so much the
   wiser, let them show their wisdom by not sneering at those who do not
   happen to possess their gifts, but who possess what is much more
   precious.

   And then it will take another shape--this shaming of the poor because
   of their poverty. Whey will say, "Ah! but they are poor in spirit; they
   have not good ideas of themselves. Hear them--they are always
   confessing sinfulness and weakness, and they appear to go through the
   world without self-reliance, relying upon some unseen power, and always
   distrusting themselves, and they do not seem to have the pluck that the
   ungodly have. Why, we, we who know not God can drink, and they will
   stop where we can go. And we can let out an oath, but they are afraid.
   And there is many a song that we can sing that these fastidious folks
   would not dare to hear, and there is many an amusement which we can
   enjoy which they, poor creatures, are obliged to deny themselves." Ah!
   well, well, if they choose to be miserable, I do not know that you
   could do better than pity them. It would be a pity to be angry with
   them for not enjoying what you enjoy. Don't, therefore, sneer. But,
   after all, sir, you know very well that there is more manliness in
   refusing to sin than there is in sinning; that there is more pluck in
   saying, "No, I cannot," than there is in being led by the devil, first
   into one sin, and then into another. And these men of the world that
   have this high spirit, and are so bold and brave--what is it better
   than the high spirit of a lunatic, who dares to put his hand in the
   fire? I dare not do that which would dishonour God. I am thankful to be
   such a coward that I dare not venture it. But you shall not say that we
   are cowardly. Lived there ever a more earnest Christian than Havelock?
   Were there ever better soldiers than his Highlanders, who learned to
   bow the knee before Jehovah? But, O sirs, they could fight; they were
   men brave enough in the day of battle, though they could not be brave
   in the way in which the ungodly are. Talk to us Christians about want
   of courage! Do you ever wish to see the Ironsides again in England,
   with old Oliver Cromwell at their head? We hate war, but still we quote
   these instances to show that a man can bow before God like .a sneaking
   Presbyterian, as you call him, and yet rise up and drive the Cavaliers,
   like chaff before the wind. It is not true that we are poor in spirit
   in the sense that is often attached to us. We have as much of courage
   of the right kind as the ungodly have. But, sir, we can afford to bear
   your jest. We are afraid to be damned; we are afraid to take a leap
   into the dark future, with wrath upon our heads; we do tremble before
   the living god, though we will tremble nowhere else. We count it no dim
   honour to fear him who is a consuming fire. But this is commonly the
   cry, "They're a poor set; they're a poor set of milksops." "Ye have
   shamed the counsel of the poor."

   But now the next point--a very common jest--is the reasons that
   Christian men give for being Christians. You notice the text says, "the
   counsel of the poor," for the Christian, when he becomes a believer in
   Christ, takes counsel about it. He does not believe his Bible because
   his grandmother did; he does not accept the Word of God because some
   priest has told him it is true; he takes counsel, and considers. This
   counsel, however, is generally sneered at, as though there were no
   reasonableness in it; therefore, let me just state it.

   The Christian has taken counsel with his own weakness. He says, "I
   cannot trust myself; I am very apt to go wrong; therefore, will I put
   myself into the great Father's hands, and pray him to lead and guide
   me. I will not go to my business in the morning until I have asked for
   his protection, nor will I close the day without asking still that I
   may be under his care." His reason is because he feels himself to be a
   weak and fallible creature, and he wants protection. That looks to me
   to be very reasonable, but to some it seems to be the theme for
   laughter.

   The Christian has next taken counsel with his observations. He has
   looked about in the world, and he could not see that ungodly men derive
   pleasure from their sins. He hears them shouting loudly enough
   sometimes, but he knows who hath woe, and who hath redness of the
   eyes?"they that tarry long at the wine," men of drink; "they that go to
   seek mixed wine." He has seen the ungodly in their quieter moments, and
   observed how unsatisfactory all their best things are, and, upon the
   whole, he considers that what the world offers to its devotees is not
   worth his seeking for. Moreover, the Christian man has sometimes seen
   the sinner die, and' having seen him die, he has discovered that there
   is nothing in the principles of ungodliness to give a man comfort in
   his dying hour. Some of us have heard language from ungodly men in
   their deaths that we would hardly like to repeat, the very memory of
   which makes our blood chill. I remember once being at the bedside of a
   man who alternately cursed and asked me to pray. I could not pray as I
   would desire. I did what I could, and thee he would tell me it was no
   good; his, sins would never be forgiven him; and then he would turn
   again to blasphemy. It was a dread sight. I never saw--and I have seen
   many ungodly people did never saw one die of whom I could say, "Let me
   die the death of this sinner, and let my last end be like his"; nor do
   I think such sights are ever or anywhere to be seen. The Christian man,
   therefore, having taken counsel of that, looks for something better
   that may be his stay in the time of trouble, and be his comfort in the
   time of his departure out of this life. That looks to me to be good
   reasoning. I think it is, and yet there are some who sneer at it.

   The Christian man has also taken counsel with the Bible. Believing it
   to be God's Word, he feels that one word of God is worth a ton weight
   of human reason. He would sooner have a drachm of revelation than have
   all the weight of authority that could be brought to bear upon his
   mind. And assuredly, if God be true, he is not incorrect in his
   judgment.

   Moreover, the Christian man has taken counsel with his own conscience,
   and he finds that when he walks near to God, he is most happy. He
   discovers that, in keeping God's commandments, there is great reward,
   and though he does not expect to be saved by his works, yet he finds
   himself most sustained when he walks most carefully and jealously
   before the world, and when most near to his heavenly Father. Taking
   such counsel as this, and finding it so much to his own inward
   advantage, I cannot blame him that he still puts his trust where he
   does.

   Moreover, the Christian man takes counsel with his own experience.
   There are some of us who are as sure that God hears our prayers as we
   are sure that twice two make four. It is to us not a conjecture, no,
   nor even a belief, but a matter of fact. We are habitually in the
   custom of going to God and asking for what we want, and receiving it at
   his hands; and it is no use anybody telling us that prayer is useless.
   We find it constantly useful. It is of no avail for people to say these
   are happy coincidences. They are very strange indeed--strange
   coincidences when they occur again and again, and again, and God
   continually hears our prayers. The witness that the Christian has to
   the truth of his religion does not lie in the books of the learned. He
   is thankful for them, but his chief witness lies here--in his own
   heart, in his own inward experience. Now we always say that you must
   speak as You find. The Christian has found God faithful to him, has
   found him support him in the time of trial, has found him answer his
   prayers in the hour of distress; and this is the counsel that he has
   taken for himself, and he, therefore, for these reasons relies upon
   God. Well, sneer as some may, I think we will do with our trust in God,
   my brethren, as the natives of a certain American State are said to
   have done when they, instead of making a law-book, agreed that the
   State should be governed by the laws of God, until they had time to
   make better--we will continue to put our trust in God until somebody
   shall show us something better; we will still pray, and get answered;
   we will still bear our troubles before God, and get rid of them; we
   will still rely upon Christ and find comfort until somebody shall bring
   us something better, and it won't be just yet; and, until then, sneers
   and laughter shall not much affect us.

   And now, once more, the great point at which the ungodly mostly aim
   their scoffs is the actual faith of the believer. He has made God to be
   his refuge. And what, what do they say, Why, "It's all canting talk." I
   do not particularly know what that means, but if ever Christian men are
   accused of being cants, they can make the retort by saying that the
   canting is quite as much on one side as the other, for of all cants the
   cant against cant is the worst cant that ever was canted. But surely if
   a man shall speak the truth in other things, and you know he does, it
   is not fair to say he does not speak the truth when he says he puts his
   trust in God. The man is not insincere.

   "Oh!" but they will say, "it is ridiculous--a man trusting in God."
   Yes, but you do not think it ridiculous to trust in yourselves. Many of
   you don't think it ridiculous to trust in some public man. Half of the
   world is trusting in its riches, and is there anything ridiculous in
   leaning upon that arm that bears the earth's huge pillars up? If so,
   ridicule on. To trust weakness seems to you to be sense. I say to trust
   Qmnipotence is infinitely superior wisdom, and we will continue to
   trust in God, for to us it seems to be no absurdity.

   "But," they will say, "what does your God do for you? Some of you
   Christian people are very poor; some of you very sick--very much in
   trouble." Mark you, our God never said we should not be, but, on the
   contrary, told us it should be so. What he does for us is this--in six
   troubles he is with us, and in the seventh he does not forsake us. He
   never made us a promise that we should be rich; he never made us a
   promise of constant help; on the contrary, it is written, "In the world
   ye shall have tribulation." But our God does this for us, that we look
   upon those troubles as being so much fire that shall purge our silver:
   so much of the winnowing fan that shall drive away the chaff and leave
   the corn clean. We glory in tribulation and rejoice in the afflictions
   which God has laid upon us. Still, that will always be a point of jest.
   But there is one remark I will make before I leave this. I should like
   any man who doubts the reality of faith in God to do go down to
   Bristol, and go to Kingsdown and see the orphan-houses there, which Mr.
   George Muller has built. Now there they stand--substantial brick and
   mortar, and inside there are 2,500 boys and girls. They eat a good
   deal, want a good deal of clothing, and so on. And how comes the money?
   All the world knows, and no man can gainsay it, that it comes in answer
   to prayer, and as the result of Mr. Muller's faith--that, that faith
   has often been tried, but has never failed. What God has done for Mr.
   Muller, he has done for scores of us after our own way, and in our own
   walk, and we glorify his name. Though that stands as a palpable
   witness, we are not less able to say than Mr. Muller, there is a God
   that heareth prayer, and whoever may jest at faith, we continue in it
   still, and glory in it, and rejoice. Now this is what is the matter of
   jest for the mockers. But my time flies, so I must now speak a few
   words only upon:--

   II. WHO ARE THE MOCKERS?

   Our text says they are fools. Well, that is my opinion; but it does not
   signify what my opinion may be. The point that does signify, however,
   is that it is God's opinion of every man who is not a believer or
   trusting in his God. In plain English, every such man is a fool. That
   is God's opinion of him--God that cannot err--who is never too severe,
   but who speaks the literal truth--that he is a fool. Let me add, it
   will be that man's opinion of himself one day. If he shall ever be
   converted--oh! that he may!--he will think himself a fool to have been
   so long an unbeliever; and if not, when the truth of Scripture shall be
   proved, and he shall be cast into hell, then will he see his folly, and
   own himself to be what God said before he was, namely, a fool. O sir,
   do not run the risk. There was an observation made by a countryman that
   is well worth quoting, when he said to the unbeliever. "I have two
   strings to my bow; you have not. Now," said he, "suppose there is no
   God, I am as well off as you are; but suppose there is, where are you?"
   So can we say, "Suppose, after all, our religion should be a delusion.
   It has made us very happy up till now; but as for you--suppose it
   should be true? Ah! where are you then, who have despised it and have
   turned away from God?" May each man who does not believe in his God
   know how foolish he is. Now as I gave you the reasons for the poor
   man's faith, let me give you the reasons why the unbeliever usually is
   an unbeliever. It is principally because he knows not God; and none of
   us like to trust a person we don't know. He knows nothing of the Most
   High, has never communed with him, nor even seen him in his works; and,
   therefore, he cannot trust him. The unbeliever will also say that he
   cannot trust God because he cannot see him, as if everything that is
   real must, therefore, be the object of sight as if there were not
   forces in nature about which no doubts can be entertained that are far
   beyond the ken of sight. They will also say that they cannot trust God
   because they cannot understand him. If we could understand God, he
   would not be God, for it is a part of the nature of God that he should
   be infinitely greater than any created mind. I have heard of a man who
   went into a smith's smithy one day, and he began complaining of the wet
   weather. "Why," said he, "smith, you talk about Providence! There is
   too much wet by half. If there were any Providence, it would manage
   things a great deal better. There is the wheat nearly all spoilt, and
   the barley is going. I tell you," says he, "there is no Providence;
   things don't go right." The smith took no notice of his observations,
   but after a while walked across the smithy, and took down an
   odd-looking tool which he used in his craft, and said to him, "Do you
   know what that is used for?" "No," said he, I don't." "Look at it; look
   at it, and find out." He did look, and then he said he did not know.
   The smith put up that tool, and took down another, an ugly-looking
   tool, and says he, "Do you know what I use that for?" "No," says the
   man, "I cannot conceive what you do with that." You can't! Look at it,
   and see; perhaps you will find out." He looked at the thing, and then
   he said, "No, I really do not know what is the use you put that to."
   The smith put it up, and then walked leisurely back and said, "You are
   a great dunce. You do not know the use of my tools, and I am only a
   smith; and you set up to judge of the use of God's tools, and say what
   is right and what is wrong. You don't even know about a smithy, and
   yet, you pretend to know about the whole world. It is a most
   unreasonable reason not to believe in God because I cannot understand
   him. The reason at the bottom is this--the ungodly man does not trust
   God, because he is God's enemy. He knows there is a quarrel between the
   two. He has broken the law, he has become an enemy to his Maker; and
   how shall a man trust his enemy? Besides, he knows that God won't do
   what he would like God to do. He would like God to give him good health
   to go on in sin; he would like him to make him happy in his lusts; he
   would like him to let him live a sinner and die a saint; he would like
   him to shape the world so that man might take his sinful pleasure and
   live as he liked, and yet, after all, receive the wages of a righteous
   life; and as God won't do that--won't bring himself down to the
   sinner's taste--therefore, the sinner says, "I cannot trust God," and
   then he turns round and laughs at the man who can, just to quiet his
   own conscience and keep the little sense there is within him from
   rebelling against him.

   Now I spoke of the Christian's faith; just let me speak of the
   unbeliever's faith. It takes much more faith to be an unbeliever than
   to be a believer. I am sure the philosophies of the present age which
   are currently set forth would require a deal more credulity than I am
   the master of. I can believe Scripture readily, and without violence to
   my soul, but I could not accept the theory even of the development of
   our race, which is so much cried up nowadays, nor a great many other
   theories. They seem to me to require a far greater sweep of credulity
   than anything that is written in the Word of God. To the ungodly man
   this seems reasonable. "It is reasonable to trust a great man, and to
   hope that he will be the maker of you; it is reasonable to trust your
   own reason--to believe you can steer your own course; it is reasonable
   to be a self-made man, self-reliant; it is reasonable to look after the
   main change; it is reasonable to get all the money you can; it is
   reasonable to put your confidence in it (of course, it has not any
   wings, and won't fly away); it is a reasonable and discreet thing to
   live in this world as if you were to live for ever in it, and never
   think of another world at all." To a great many it seems to be
   philosophy to get as far away from God as ever you possibly can, and
   then you will get to be a wise man that the creature is wisest when it
   forgets its creator. That is the world's creed, and I can only say that
   if they scoff at our creed, we can fairly enough scoff at theirs. Trust
   in yourselves! Why, you are fools to think of such a thing. Trust in
   your wealth! Have you not seen rich men disappear? How about a few
   years ago when--we must remember it well, and remember it
   sorrowfully--how a panic comes, and down go the towers of the great,
   and those who seemed to be rich burst like bubbles And oh! the joys of
   earth! How soon are they scattered, how speedily do they disappear!
   What are they, after all, but a will o' the wisp? If it be a wise thing
   to live in this world, and never think of dying, God grant that I may
   be a fool. If it be a wise thing to think all about this poor body, and
   never about my immortal soul, may I never know such wisdom. If it be a
   wise thing to go into the future as a leap in the dark, believing
   nothing, and only by that means kept from fear, may I never know such
   philosophy. Truly it seems to me to be wisdom that I, a creature who
   certainly did not make myself, should think of my Creator; that I, a
   sinner, should accept that blessed way of salvation, which is laid
   before me in the Word of God; that I, weak and unable to steer my own
   course, should put my hand into the great Father's hand and say, "Lead
   me, guide me by thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory." This
   may be jested at and sneered at, but it can bear a sneer and will
   outlive the mocker. Now, lastly:--

   III. HOW OUGHT THOSE WHO ARE MOCKED BEHAVE towards those that at mock
   at them? Well, the first thing is, never yield an inch. You young men
   in the great firms of London, you working men that work in the
   factories--you are sneered at. Let them sneer. If they can sneer you
   out of your religion, you have not got any worth having. Remember you
   can be laughed into hell, but you can never be laughed out of it. A man
   may by ridicule give up what religion he thought he had, but if he cast
   away his soul, his companions who caused his loss cannot help him in
   the day of his travail, and anguish, and bitterness, before the throne
   of the Most High. Why be ashamed? "They called me a saint." I remember
   once a person calling me a saint in the street. All I thought was, "I
   wish he could prove it." Once a man, passing me in the street, said,
   "There is John Bunyan." I think I felt six inches taller at the least.
   I was delighted to be called by such a name as that. "Oh! but they will
   point at you." Cannot you bear to be pointed at? "But they will chaff
   you." Chaff--let them chaff you. Can that hurt a man that is a man? If
   you are a molluscous creature that has no backbone, you may be afraid
   of jokes, and jeers, and jests; but if God has made you upright, stand
   upright and be a man. Moreover, there is one thing you should always do
   when you are ashamed--pray. The next verse in the Psalm is, "Oh! that
   God would turn the captivity of Zion." The best refuge for a believer
   in times of persecution is his secret resort to God. Let him to on his
   kneed and say, "My Lord, I have been counted worthy to be spoken ill of
   for thy name's sake. Help me to bear it. Now is my time of trial.
   Strengthen me to bear this reproach. Grant that it may be no heavy
   burden to me, but may I rather rejoice in it for thy name's sake." God
   will help you, beloved.

   Then next to that, pray always, most for those who treat you worst.
   Make them the constant subjects of your prayer.

   And then I would say, in your actions prove the sincerity of your
   prayers by extra kindness towards those who are unkind to you. Heap
   coals of fire upon their head. That is an expression not always
   explained. When the crucible is to be brought to a great heat, and the
   metal to be thoroughly melted, it is not enough for the coals all
   around it to glow. The silversmith that is desiring to melt it
   thoroughly will heap them so that the metal shall be all surrounded by
   flames. Do so, I pray you, with any of your enemies; heap kindnesses
   upon them. A Christian woman had often prayed for a very ungodly and
   unkind husband, but her prayers were not heard. However she did this,
   she treated him more kindly than she had ever done before. If there was
   any little thing that she could think of that would please his palate,
   if she had to deny herself, that would be on the table. She kept the
   house scrupulously comfortable, and did all she could. And one day
   someone said to her, "How is it that you, with such a husband can act
   so towards him?" "Well," she said, "I hope I shall win his soul yet,
   but if not"--and then the tears came in her eyes--all the happiness he
   will have will be in this life, and so I will let him have all I can
   possibly give him, since he has no happiness in the life to come." Do
   that with the ungodly. Lay yourself out to oblige and serve them. Let
   it be known of you that the best way to get a good turn out of you is
   to do you a bad turn. "Oh!" says one, "it is too hard. Tread on a worm,
   and it will turn." And is a worm to be an example to a Christian?
   Christ Jesus, art thou not better for an exemplar than a poor worm that
   creeps into the earth? What did our Saviour do but pray for his
   murderers? The blood they shed redeemed them that shed it. We have
   heard the old story of the sandal-wood tree that perfumes the axe that
   cuts it. Do you so, O Christian! Perfume with your love the axe that
   wounds you. Be like the anvil that never strikes the hammer again, but
   yet the anvil wears out many hammers by its indomitable patience. Be
   patient, be courteous, be kind--in a word, Christ-like; and how know
   you that these very persons who hate you most to-day will not love you
   well to-morrow, and come together with you to the communion table, and
   together rejoice in our blessed Saviour?

   Now if I have seemed to preach too harshly to-night, it is not so in my
   heart. Oh! how I wish you all, everyone without exception, knew what a
   blessed life the Christian life is! I would, not lie for God himself,
   but I speak the truth to you. I never knew what perfect peace was until
   I looked to Christ upon the cross, and rested my soul on him. I have
   had trials, and have suffered bitter pains, but I have always found
   consolation when I have turned my eyes to my bleeding Saviour, and have
   given myself up again to the great Father's hands. He is a blessed
   Lord. I serve a good Master. Trust him, give your hearts up to him, and
   if you have spoken against his people, or rebelled against his love, he
   is willing to receive you. He has no hard word to say to returning
   ones. Come to him; come and welcome. Come just now, and the Lord
   receive you, for his mercy's sake. Amen.

                           Christ's Marvellous Giving

   A Sermon

   (No. 3513)

   Published on Thursday, May 25th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [21]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   ON Lord's-day Evening, November 25th, 1866.

   "Who gave himself for us."--Titus 2:14.

   WE have once more, you see, the old subject. We still have to tell the
   story of the love of God towards man in the person of his only begotten
   Son, Jesus Christ. When you come to your table you find a variety
   there. Sometimes there is one dish upon it, and sometimes another; but
   you are never at all surprised to find the bread there every time, and,
   perhaps, we might add that there would be a deficiency if there were
   not salt there every time too. So there are certain truths which cannot
   be repeated too often, and especially is this true of this
   master-truth, that "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto
   himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them." Why, this is the
   bread of life; "God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten
   Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life." This is the salt upon the table, and must never be
   forgotten, This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
   "that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, even the
   chief."

   Now we shall take the text, and use it thus: first of all we shall ask
   it some questions; then we shall surround it with a setting of facts;
   and when we have done that, we will endeavour to press out of it its
   very soul as we draw certain inferences from it. First then:--

   I. WE WILL PUT THE TEXT INTO THE WITNESS-BOX, AND ASK IT A FEW
   QUESTIONS.

   There are only five words in the text, and we will be content to let it
   go with four questions. "Who gave himself for us" The first question we
   ask the text is, Who is this that is spoken of? and the text gives the
   answer. It is "the great God and our Saviour, Jesus Christ, who gave
   himself for us." We had offended God; the dignity of divine justice
   demanded that offenses against so good and just a law as that which God
   had promulgated should not be allowed to go unpunished. But the
   attribute of justice is not the only one in the heart of God. God is
   love, and is, therefore, full Of mercy. Yet, nevertheless, he never
   permits one quality of his Godhead to triumph over another. He could
   not be too merciful, and so become unjust; he would not permit mercy to
   put justice to an eclipse. The difficulty was solved thus: God himself
   stooped from his loftiness and veiled his glory in a garb of our
   inferior clay. The Word--that same Word without whom was not anything
   made that was made--became flesh, and dwelt amongst us; and his
   apostles, his friends, and his enemies, beheld him--the seed of the
   woman, but yet the Son of God, very God of very God, in all the majesty
   of deity, and yet man of the substance of his mother in all the
   weakness of our humanity, sin being the only thing which separated us
   from him, he being without sin, and we being full of it. It is, then,
   God, who "gave himself for us"; it is, then, man, who gave himself for
   us. It is Jesus Christ, co-equal and co-eternal with the Father, who
   thought it not robbery to be equal with God; who made himself of no
   reputation, and took upon himself the form of a servant, and was made
   in the likeness of sinful flesh, and, being found in fashion as a man,
   humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
   cross. It is Christ Jesus, the man, the God, "who gave himself for us."
   Now I hope we shall not make any mistakes here, for mistakes here will
   be fatal. We may be thought uncharitable for saying it, but we should
   be dishonest if we did not say it, that it is essential to be right
   here.

   "Ye cannot be right in the rest

   Unless ye think rightly of him."

   You dishonour Christ if you do not believe in his deity. He will have
   nothing to do with you unless you accept him as being God as well as
   man. You must receive him as being, without any diminution, completely
   and wholly divine, and you must accept him as being your brother, as
   being a man just as you are. This, this is the person, and, relying
   upon him, we shall find salvation; but, rejecting his deity, he will
   say to us, "You know me not, and I never knew you!"

   The text has answered the question "Who?" and now, putting it in the
   witness-box again, we ask it another question--"What? What did he do?"
   The answer is, "He gave himself for us." It was a gift. Christ's
   offering of himself for us was voluntary; he did it of his own will. He
   did not die because we merited that, he should love us to the death; on
   the contrary, we merited that he should hate us; we deserved that he
   should cast us from his presence obnoxious things, for we were full of
   sin. We were the wicked keepers of the vineyard, who devoured for our
   own profit the fruit which belonged to the King's Son, and he is that
   King's Son, whom we slew, with wicked hands ousting him out of the
   vineyard. But he died for us who were his enemies. Remember the words
   of Scripture, "Scarcely for a righteous man will one die; peradventure,
   for a good, a generous man, one might even dare to die; but God
   commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners,
   Christ died for the ungodly." He gave himself. We cannot purchase the
   love of God. This highest expression of divine love, the gift of his
   own Son, was, in the nature of things, unpurchaseable. What could we
   have offered that God should come into this world, and be found in
   fashion as a man, and should die? Why, the works of all the angels in
   heaven put together could not have deserved one pang from Christ. If
   for ever the angels had continued their ceaseless songs, and if all men
   had remained faithful, and could have heaped up their pile of merit to
   add to that of the angels, and if all the creatures that ever were, or
   ever shall be, could each bring in their golden hemp of merit--yet
   could they ever deserve you cross? Could they deserve that the Son of
   God should hang bleeding and dying there? Impossible! It must by a
   gift, for it was utterly unpurchaseable; though all worlds were coined
   and minted, yet could they not have purchased a tear from the Redeemer;
   they were not worth it. It must be grace; it cannot be merit; he gave
   himself.

   And the gift is so thoroughly a gift that no prep of any kind was
   brought to bear upon the Saviour. There was no necessity that he should
   die, except the necessity of his loving us. Ah! friends, we might have
   been blotted out of existence, and I do not know that there would have
   been any lack in God's universe if the whole race of man had
   disappeared. That universe is too wide and great to miss such chirping
   grasshoppers as we are. When one star is blotted out it may make a
   little difference to our midnight sky, but to an eye that sees
   immensity it can make no change. Know ye not that this little solar
   system, which we think so vast, and those distant fixed stars, and yon
   mighty masses of nebulae, if such they be, and yonder streaming comet,
   with its stupendous walk of grandeur--all these are only like a little
   corner in the field of God's great works? He taketh them all up as
   nothing, and considereth them mighty as they be, and beyond all human
   conception great--to be but the small dust of the balance which does
   not turn the scale; and if they were all gone to-morrow there would be
   no more loss than as if a few grains of dust were thrown to the
   summer's wind. But God himself must stoop, rather than we should die.
   Oh! what magnificence of love! And the more so because there was no
   need for it. In the course of nature God would have been as holy and as
   heavenly without us as he is with us, and the pomp of yonder skies
   would have been as illustrious had we been dashed into the flames of
   hell as it will be now. God hath gained nought, except the
   manifestation of a love beyond an angel's dream; a grace, the heights,
   and depths, and lengths, and breadths of which surpass all knowledge of
   all creatures. God only knows the love of God which is manifested in
   Jesus Christ. He gave himself. We will leave this point now, when it is
   fully understood that Christ's dying to save sinners, and giving
   himself for the ungodly, was a pure act of gratuitous mercy. There was
   nothing to compel God to give his Son, and nothing to lead the Son to
   die, except the simple might of his love to men. He would not see us
   die. He had a Father's love to us. He seemed to stand over our fallen
   race, as David stood over Absalom, and we were as bad as Absalom; and
   there he fled, and said, "My son, my son! Would God I had died for
   thee, my son, my son!" But he did more than this, for he did die for
   us. and all for love of Us who were his enemies!

   "So strange, so boundless was the love,

   Which pitied dying man;

   The Father sent his equal Son

   To give them life again."

   'Twas all of love and of grace!

   The third question is, "What did he give?" "Who gave himself for us,"
   and here lies the glory of the text, that he gave not merely the crowns
   and royalties of heaven, though it was much to leave these, to come and
   don the humble garb of a carpenter's son; not the songs of seraphs, not
   the shouts of cherubim: 'twas something to leave them to come and dwell
   amongst the groans and tears of this poor fallen world; not the
   grandeur of his Father's court, though it was much to leave that to
   come and live with wild beasts, and men more wild than they, to fast
   his forty days and then to die in ignomy and shame upon the tree. No;
   there is little said about all this. He gave all this, it is true, but
   he gave himself. Mark, brethren, what a richness there is here! It is
   not that he gave his righteousness, though that has become our dress.
   It is not even that he gave his blood, though that is the fount in
   which we wash. It is that he gave himself--his Godhead and manhood both
   combined. All that that word "Christ" means he came to us and for us.
   He gave himself. Oh! that we could dive and plunge into--this
   unfathomed sea--himself! Omnipotence, Omniscience, Infinity--himself.
   He gave himself--purity, love, kindness, meekness, gentleness--that
   wonderful compound of all perfections, to make up one
   perfection-himself. You do not come to Christ's house and say, "He
   gives me this house, his church, to dwell in." You do not come to his
   table and merely say, "He gives me this table to feast at," but you go
   farther, and you take him by faith into your arms, and you say, "Who
   loved me, and gave himself for me." Oh! that you could get hold of that
   sweet word--himself! It is the love of a husband to his wife, who not
   only gives her all that she can wish, daily food and raiment, and all
   the comforts that can nourish and cherish her, and make her life glad,
   but who gives himself to her. So does Jesus. The body and soul of
   Jesus, the deity of Jesus, and all that that means, he has been pleased
   to give to and for his people. "Who gave himself for us."

   There is another question which we shall ask the text, and that is,
   "For whom did Christ give himself?" Well, the text says, "For us."
   There be those who say that Christ has thus given himself for every man
   now living, or that ever did or shall live. We are not able to
   subscribe to the statement, though there is a truth in it, that in a
   certain sense he is "the Saviour of all men," but then it is added,
   "Specially of them that believe." At any rate, dear hearer, let me tell
   thee one thing that is certain. Whether atonement may be said to be
   particular or general, there are none who partake in its real efficacy
   but certain characters, and those characters are known by certain
   infallible signs. You must not say that he gave himself for you unless
   these signs are manifest in you, and the first sign is that of simple
   faith in the Lord Jesus. If thou believest in him, that shall be a
   proof to thee that he gave himself for thee. See, if he gave himself
   for all men alike, then he did equally for Judas and for Peter. Care
   you for such love as that? He died equally for those who were then in
   hell as for those who were then in heaven. Care you for such a doctrine
   as that? For my part, I desire to have a personal, peculiar, and
   special interest in the precious blood of Jesus; such an interest in it
   as shall lead me to his right hand, and enable me to say, "He hath
   washed me from my sins, in his blood." Now I think we have no right to
   conclude that we shall have any benefit from the death of Christ unless
   we trust him, and if we do trust him, that trust will produce the
   following things:--"Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us
   from all iniquity"--we shall hate sin; we shall fight against it; we
   shall be delivered from it? "and purify unto himself, a peculiar
   people, zealous of good works." I have no right. therefore, to conclude
   that I shall be a partaker of the precious blood of Jesus unless I
   become in my life "zealous of good works," My good works cannot save
   me, cannot even help to save me; but they are evidences of my being
   saved, and if I am not zealous for good works, I lack the evidence of
   salvation, and I have no right whatever to conclude that I shall
   receive one jot of benefit from Christ's sufferings upon the tree. Oh!
   my dear hearer, I would to God that thou couldest trust the Man, the
   God, who died on Calvary! I would that thou couldest trust him so that
   thou couldest say, "He will save me; he has saved me." The gratitude
   which you would feel towards him would inspire you with an invincible
   hatred against sin. You would begin to fight against every evil way;
   you would conform yourselves, by his grace, to his law and his Word,
   and you would become a new creature in him! May God grant that you may
   yet be able to say, "Who gave himself for me"! I have asked the text
   enough questions, and there I leave them. For a few minutes only I am
   now going to use the text another way, namely:--

   II. PUT THE TEXT INTO A SETTING OF FACTS.

   There was a day before all days when there was no day but the Ancient
   of Days; a time when there was no time, but when Eternity was all. Then
   God, in the eterna1 purpose, decreed to save his people. If we may
   speak so of things too mysterious for us to know them, and which we can
   only set forth after the manner of men, God had determined that his
   people should be saved, but he foresaw that they would sin. It was
   necessary, therefore. that the penalty due to their sins should be
   borne by someone. They could not be saved except a substitute were
   found who would bear the penalty of sin in their place and stead. Where
   was such a substitute to be found? No angel offered. There was no
   angel, for God dwelt alone, and even if there had then been angels,
   they could never have dared to offer to sustain the fearful weight of
   human guilt. But in that solemn council-chamber, when it was
   deliberated who should enter into bonds of suretyship to pay all the
   debts of the people of God, Christ came and gave himself a bondsman and
   a surety for all that was due--from them, or would be due from them, to
   the judgment-seat of God. In that day, then, he "gave himself for us."

   But Time began, and this round world had made, in the mind of God, a
   few revolutions. Men said the world was getting old, but to God it was
   but an infant. But the fulness of time was come, and suddenly, amidst
   the darkness of the night, there was heard sweeter singing than ere had
   come from mortal lips, "Glory to God in the highest; on earth peace;
   good will to men!" What lit up the sky with unwonted splendour and what
   had filled the air with chorales at the dead of night? See the Babe
   upon its mother's breast, there in Bethlehem's manger! "He gave himself
   for us." That same one who had given himself a surety has come down to
   earth to be a man, and to give himself for us. See him! For thirty
   years he toils on, amidst the drudgery of the carpenters shop! What is
   he doing? The law needed to be fulfilled, and he "gave himself for us,"
   and fulfilled the law. But now the time comes when he is thirty-two or
   thirty-three years of age, and the law demands that the penalty shall
   be paid. Do you see him going to meet Judas in the garden, with
   confident, but solemn step? He "gave himself for us." He could with a
   word have driven those soldiers into hell, but they bind him--he "gave
   himself for us." They take him before Pilate, and Herod and Caiaphas,
   and they mock at him, and jeer him, and pluck his cheeks, and
   flagellate his shoulders! How is it that he will smart at this rate?
   How is it that he bears so passively all the insults and indignities
   which they heap upon him? He gave himself for us. Our sins demanded
   smart; he bared his back and took the smart; he have himself for us.
   But do you see that dreadful procession going through the streets of
   Jerusalem, along the rough pavement of the Via Dolorosa? Do you see the
   weeping women as they mourn because of him? How is it that he is
   willing to be led a captive up to the hill of Calvary? Alas! they throw
   him on the around! They drive accursed iron through his hands and feet.
   They hoist him into the air! They dash the cross into its appointed
   place, and there he hangs, a naked spectacle of scorn and shame,
   derided of men, and mourned by angels. How is it that the Lord of
   glory, who made all worlds, and hung out the stars like lamps, should
   now be bleeding and dying there? He gave himself for us. Can you see
   the streaming fountains of the four wounds in his hands and feet' Can
   you trace his agony as it carves lines upon his brow and all down his
   emaciated frame? No you cannot see the griefs of his soul. No spirit
   can behold them. They were too terrible for you to know them. It seemed
   as though all hell were emptied into the bosom of the Son of God, and
   as though all the miseries of all the ages were made to meet upon him,
   till he bore:--

   "All that incarnate God, could bear,

   With strength enough, but none to spare."

   Now why is all this but that he gave himself for us till his head hung
   down in death, and his arms, in chill, cold death, hung down by his
   side, and they buried the lifeless Victor in the tomb of Joseph of
   Arimethea? He gave himself for us!

   What more now remaineth? He lives again; on the third day he cometh
   from the tomb, and even then he still gave himself for us! Oh! yes,
   beloved, he has gone up on high but he still gives himself for us, for
   up there he is constantly engaged in pleading the sinner's cause. Up
   yonder, amidst the glories of heaven, he has not forgotten us poor
   sinners who are here below, but he spreads his hands, and pleads before
   his Father's throne and wins for us unnumbered blessings, for he gave
   himself for us.

   And I have been thinking whether I might not use the text in another
   way. Christ's servants wanted a subject upon which to preach, and so he
   "gave himself for us," to be the constant topic of our ministry.
   Christ's servants wanted a sweet companion to be with them in their
   troubles, and he gave himself for us. Christ's people want comfort;
   they want spiritual food and drink, and so he gave himself for us--his
   flesh to be our meat, and his blood to be our spiritual drink. And we
   expect soon to go home to the land of the hereafter, to the realms of
   the blessed, and what is to be our heaven? Why, our heaven will be
   Christ himself, for he gave himself for Us. Oh! he is all that we want,
   all that we wish for! We cannot desire anything greater and better than
   to be with Christ, and to have Christ, to feed upon Christ, to lie in
   Christ's bosom, to know the kisses of his mouth, to look at the
   gleamings of his loving eyes, to hear his loving words, to feel him
   press us to his heart, and tell us that he has loved us from before the
   foundation of the world, and given himself for us.

   I think we have put the text now into a setting of certain facts; do
   not forget them, but let them be your joy! And now the last thing we
   have to do is to:--

   III. TURN THE TEXT TO PRACTICAL ACCOUNT BY DRAWING FROM IT A FEW
   INFERENCES.

   The first inference I draw is this--that be who gave himself for his
   people will cat deny them anything. This is a sweet encouragement to
   you who practice the art of prayer. You know how Paul puts it, "He that
   spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he
   not, with him, also freely give us all things?" Christ is all. If
   Christ gives himself to you, he will give you your bread and your
   water, and he will give you a house to dwell in. If he gives you
   himself, he will not let you starve on the road to heaven. Jesus Christ
   does not Give us himself and then deny us common things. Oh! child of
   God, go boldly to the throne of grace! Thou hast got the major; thou
   shalt certainly have the minor; thou hast the greater, thou canst not
   be denied the less.

   Now I draw another inference, namely, that if Christ has already given
   himself in so painful a way as I have described, since there is no need
   that he should suffer any more, we must believe that he is willing to
   give himself now unto the hearts of poor sinners. Beloved, for Christ
   to come to Bethlehem is a greater stoop than for him to come into your
   heart. Had Christ to die upon Calvary? That is all done, and he need
   not die again. Do you think that he who is willing to die is unwilling
   to apply the results of his passion? If a man leaps into the water to
   bring out a drowning child, after he has brought the child alive on
   shore, if he happens to have a piece of bread in his pocket, and the
   child needs it, do you think that he who rescued the child's life will
   deny that child so small a thing as a piece of bread? And come, dost
   thou think that Christ died on Calvary, and yet will not come into thy
   heart if thou seekest him? Dost thou believe that he who died for
   sinners will ever reject the prayer of a sinner? If thou believest that
   thou thinkest hardly of him, for his heart is very tender. He feels
   even a cry. You know how it is with your children; if they cry through
   pain, why, you would give anything for someone to come and heal them;
   and if you cry because your sin is painful, the great Physician will
   come and heal you. Ah! Jesus Christ is much more easily moved by our
   cries and tears than we are by the vies of our fellow-creatures. Come,
   poor sinner, come and put thy trust in my Master! Thou canst not think
   him hard-hearted. If he were, why did he die? Dost thou think him
   unkind? Then why did he bleed? Thou art inclined to think so hardly of
   him! Thou art making great cuts at his heart when thou thinkest him to
   be untender and ungenerous. "As I live, saith the Lord, I have no
   pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but rather that he would turn
   unto me and live." This is the voice of the God whom you look upon as
   so sternly just! Did Jesus Christ, the tender one, speak in even more
   plaintive tones, "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden,
   and I will give you rest"? You working men, you labouring men, Christ
   bids you come to him "all ye that labour." And you who are unhappy, you
   who know you have done wrong, and cannot sleep at nights because of it;
   you who are troubled about sin, and would fain go and hide your heads,
   and get:--

   "Anywhere, anywhere out of the world,"

   --your Father says to you one and all, "Run not from me, but come to
   me, my child!" Jesus, who died, says, "Flee not from me, but come to
   me, for I will accept you; I will receive you; I cast out none that
   come unto me. "Sinner, Jesus never did reject a coming soul yet, and he
   never will. Oh! try him! Try him! Now come, with thy sins about thee
   just as thou art, to the bleeding, dying Saviour, and he will say to
   thee, "I have blotted out thy sins; go and sin no more; I have forgiven
   thee." May God grant thee grace to put thy trust in him "who gave
   himself for us"!

   There are many other inferences which I might draw if I had time, but
   if this last one we have drawn be so applied to your hearts as to be
   carried out, it will be enough. Now do not you go and try to do good
   worlds in order to merit heaven. Do not go and try to pray yourselves
   into heaven by the efficacy of praying. Remember, he "gave himself for
   us." The old proverb is that "there is nothing freer than a gift," and
   surely this gift of God, this eternal life, must be free, and we must
   have it freely, or not at all. I sometimes see put up at some of our
   doctors that they receive "gratis patients." That is the sort of
   patients my Master receives. He receives none but those who come
   gratis. He never did receive anything yet, and he never will, except
   your love and your thanks after he has saved you. But you must come to
   him empty-handed; came just as you are, and he will receive you now,
   and you shall live to sing to the praise and the glory of his grace who
   has accepted you in the Beloved, and "who gave himself for us" God help
   you to do it. Amen.

                             A Prospect of Revival

   A Sermon

   (No. 3514)

   Published on Thursday, June 1st, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [22]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   "For the Lord shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places
   and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the
   garden of the Lord; joy and gladness shall be found therein,
   thanksgiving, and the voice of melody."--Isaiah 51:3.

   THE pedigree of God's chosen nation Israel may be traced back to one
   man and one woman--to Abraham and Sarah. Both of them were well
   stricken in years when the Lord called them, yet, in the fulfilment of
   his promise, he built up of their seed a great nation, which, for
   number, was comparable to the stars of heaven. Take heart, brethren;
   these things are written for our example and for our encouragement. His
   Church can never sink to so low an ebb that he cannot soon build her up
   again, nor in our own hearts can the work of grace ever decline so
   grievously that the same mighty power which once quickened cannot
   revive and restore us. Think of Abraham and Sarah, childless till they
   were old, then rejoicing in one son, who became their heir. Hence
   sprang the great multitude that peopled Palestine. With such a panorama
   unfolding before you, there is no excuse for despair; but you may find
   ten thousand reasons for confidence in God.

   With such preface the Lord proceeds to unfold to his people a series of
   delightful promises. As we have no time to spare, and no words to
   waste, we will plunge at once into the heart of the text, and observe,
   first, that you have before you:--

   I. HEAVENLY COMFORT PROMISED.

   This is a promise to God's Church. There are some who would have us
   always restrain Isaiah's prophecies to the Jews, as though this was
   their exclusive application. I have no objection to your so
   understanding them in their original and literal sense, nor have I any
   objection to our friends labouring for the Jews especially, as a class;
   far rather would I commend them. Only, I would have them recollect that
   no Scripture is of private interpretation that, in God's sight, neither
   Jews nor Gentiles are recognised under this dispensation of the gospel,
   for he has made both one in Christ Jesus. I, therefore, as a Christian
   minister, when I preach the gospel, know neither Jew nor Gentile, male
   nor female, bond nor free, but I simply know men as men, and go out
   into the world to "preach the gospel to every creature." It seems to me
   that this is the order in which God would have his Church carry out
   every evangelical enterprise, forgetting and ignoring all fleshly
   distinctions, understanding that now men are either sinners or saints.
   As to circumcision or uncircumcision, vast as its importance in the
   kingdom of Israel, it is of no account in the kingdom of God. The text,
   we believe, whatever may be its relation to the Jews as a people,
   belongs to the Church of God and the disciples of Christ; for "all
   things are yours." Zion was the stronghold of Jerusalem. Originally a
   fortress of the Jebusites, it was taken by a feat of arms by David and
   his valiant men. It became afterwards the residence of David, and
   there, too, was the residence of the Great King; for in it was built
   the temple which became the glory of all lands. Hence the Church of
   God--which has been captured by Christ from the world, which is the
   palace where he dwells, which is the temple where he is worshipped--is
   frequently called "Zion," and the Zion of this passage, I believe, we
   are warranted in interpreting as the Church of the living God.

   We are told here, then, that the Lord will comfort his Church. Let the
   object of this comfort, therefore, engage your attention. "The Lord
   will comfort Zion." Well he may, for she is his chosen. "The Lord hath
   chosen Zion." He would have those upon whom his choice is fixed be glad
   and happy. The elect of a great king have cause for thankfulness, but
   the chosen of the King of Kings should rejoice continually in the God
   that chose them. He would have his Church rejoice because he has not
   only chosen her, but he has cleansed her. Jesus has put away the sin of
   his people by his blood, and by his Spirit he is daily renewing the
   nature of his children. Sin is the cause of sorrow, and when sin is put
   away sorrow shall be put away too. The sanctified should be happy. The
   Lord will, therefore, comfort them, because he cleansed them. The
   Church of God is placed where God dwells:--

   "Where God doth dwell sure heaven is there;

   And singing there should be."

   What can ye conceive of weeping and lamenting in the house where
   Jehovah dwelleth? It was a rule with one of the old monarchs that no
   one should come into his presence sad. In all our afflictions we may
   draw near to the Lord, but his presence should dispel our sorrow and
   sighing; for the children of Zion should be joyful in their King. If
   the Lord dwelleth in the midst of his people, there ought to be
   shootings of joy. The presence of the King of Heaven is the heaven of
   their delight. Moreover, Zion enjoys her Monarchs love, and therefore,
   he would have her comforted. We know not how dear to the heart of
   Christ his Church is, but we do know this: that for his Church he left
   his Father's house and came down to earth, and was poor, that she,
   through his poverty, might be made rich. A man leaveth father and
   mother, and cleaveth to his wife, and they become one flesh; but what
   shall I say of the great mystery of this glorious Lover, who left his
   Father's house, and did cleave unto his Church, and became one flesh
   with her that he might lift her up and set her upon his own throne,
   that she might reign with him as the Bride, the Lamb's Wife? Well may,
   therefore, the Lord desire his Church to be happy. Eternal love has
   fixed itself upon her. Eternal purposes cluster around her. Eternal
   power is sworn to protect her. Eternal faithfulness has guaranteed
   eternal life to all her citizens. Why should she not be comforted? I do
   not wonder that the text says the Lord will comfort the people whom he
   has thus favoured.

   And the Lord himself is the Comforter. "The Lord will comfort Zion."
   Beloved, we make but sorry comforters for God's people unless Jehovah
   puts his own hand to the work. I have sometime tried to cheer up my
   brethren when they have been desponding, and I hope not without
   success; yet I have always felt that to relieve and refresh a
   desponding saint, I must fetch the remedies from my Master's pharmacy.
   So, doubtless, those of you who have ever sought to obey the command,
   "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people," must have found that it was not
   your word that could comfort Zion, nor your sympathy, but God's truth
   applied by God' Spirit, for this alone can comfort Zion. Oh! blessed
   promise! "The Lord will comfort Zion; he will comfort her waste
   places." He that made the heavens will become the Comforter of his
   people. The Holy Ghost, who brooded over chaos, and brought order out
   of confusion; the mighty Spirit who came down at Pentecost in tongues
   of fire, with a sound like a mighty rushing wind--that same blessed
   Spirit will come to the hearts of the members of his Church and comfort
   them. There are sorrows for which there is no solace within the reach
   of the creature; there is a ruin which it would baffle any mortal to
   retrieve. Happy for us that the Omnipotent comes to our aid. It is "he
   who telleth the number of the stars; calleth them all by their names";
   who also "healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds!"
   Where he is, rolling the stars along, filling heaven with wonder as he
   creates majestic orbs, and keeps them in their pathways, making the
   comet fling its gorgeous light across space and startle nations,
   holding the burning furnace of the sun in the hollow of his hand; yet
   he stoops down to minister to a desponding spirit, and to pour the oil
   and wine of heavenly comfort into a poor distracted heart! Yes, it is
   Zion that is to be comforted, but it is Jehovah himself who has
   promised to be her Comforter!

   And how does the Lord propose to comfort Zion? If you read the verse
   through, you will find it is by making her fertile. He will turn her
   barren deserts into fruitful gardens, and her unproductive wilderness
   into a blooming Eden. The true way to comfort the Church is to build
   her synagogues, restore the desolation of former times, to sow her
   fields, plant her vineyards, make her soil fruitful, call out the
   industry of her sons and daughters, and fill them with lively, ardent
   zeal. There is an everlasting consolation for the Church in those grand
   doctrines of grace revealed to us in covenant, such as election,
   particular redemption, effectual calling, final perseverance, and the
   faithfulness of God. Resting in his love, God forbid that we should
   ever keep back these grand truths; they are the wells of salvation from
   which we rejoice to draw the water of life. But there are other truths
   besides these and we could not make full proof of our ministry if we
   overlooked the rain, even the former and the latter rain, which God
   gives in due season, or withholds in his chastening anger. I have often
   remarked that those persons who are always crying after the comfort
   that is to be derived from the stability of God's purpose are strangely
   lacking in that present joy and jubilant song which revels in the
   goodness of the Lord, who clothes the pastures with flocks, and covers
   the valleys over with corn. I have also remarked that the best way to
   make a Christian man happy is to make him useful, ploughing the fields
   which God has watered, and gathering the fruits which he has ripened. A
   Christian Church never enjoys so much concord, love, and happiness as
   when every member is kept hard at work for God, every soul upon the
   stretch of anxiety to do good and communicate, every disciple a good
   soldier of the Cross, fighting the common enemy. Thus the Lord will
   comfort Zion, and he comforts her by turning her desert into a garden,
   and her wilderness into Eden.

   And oh! my brethren, how happy is the Church when all the members are
   active, all the trees bearing fruit; when sinners are converted, and
   daily added to the fellowship of the saved; when, instead of the thorn,
   there comes up the myrtle, and instead of the briar, there comes up the
   fir-tree; when God is turning hard hearts, that were, like rocks, into
   good soil, where the corn of the Kingdom may grow. There is no joy like
   it! If you can be happy in seeking your own good, without caring for
   the welfare of others, I pity you. If a minister can be content to go
   on preaching without converts or baptisms, the Lord have mercy upon his
   miserable soul! Can he be a minister of Christ who does not win souls?
   A man might as well be a huntsman and never take any prey; a fisherman,
   and always come home with empty nets; a husbandman, and never reap a
   harvest! I wonder at some people's complacency. When God never blesses
   them, they never fail to bless themselves. "Divine sovereignty
   withholds the increase," they say. But it really is their idleness that
   tends to poverty. The promise of God is to the diligent, not the
   indolent. Let Paul plant, and let Apollos water, God will give the
   increase. It may not come to-day, nor to-morrow, nor the next day, but
   come it must. The Word cannot return unto God void. It must prosper in
   the thing whereto he has sent it. Had God sent us on a listless,
   bootless errand, we might well complain, but he doth not so. Only let
   us preach Jesus Christ with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven, and
   we shall, doubtless, come again rejoicing, bringing our sheaves with
   us. Although when we went forth, we wept because of our inability and
   our want of confidence, yet this is the way in which God comforts us.

   The promise, you will observe, is given in words that contain an
   absolute pledge. He shall and he will are terms that admit of no
   equivocation. What an emphasis that man of God, the late Joseph Irons,
   used to lay on the words when he got hold of a "shall" and a "will"
   from, the mouth of the Lord! Though some people say we must not make
   too much of little words, I will venture to make as much as ever I can
   of these two potent monosyllables. "The Lord shall comfort Zion; the
   Lord will comfort all her waste places." How much better and brighter
   this reads than an "if," or a "but," or a "perhaps," or a
   "peradventure"! He shall comfort Zion. Oh! how those dear saints, the
   Covenanters, when they were hunted about, and fled into dens and caves,
   said, "Ah! but King Jesus will have his own; he shall comfort Zion!"
   And our Puritan forefathers, when priests threatened to harry them out
   of the land, could see with prophetic eye the time when the harlot
   church would yet be driven out, and the true, legitimate children of
   God would take her place; they could say, "The Lord shall comfort
   Zion," and they looked forward to happier halcyon days. No less did
   those glorious Albigenses and Waldenses, when they stained the snows of
   the Alps with their blood, feel confident that the Church of Rome would
   not gain the day, that God would yet return and avenge the blood of his
   martyred saints, and give the victory to his true people. And surely
   you and I may take comfort too. "The Lord shall comfort Zion; he will
   comfort her waste places." Brethren, there are brighter days to come.
   The day breaketh, and the shadows flee away! Our hope is in God. Never
   doubt the true progress of the Church. Believe that, notwithstanding
   every discouragement that checks our progress, the cause of God goes
   on; it must go on, and it shall go on, till King Jesus is universally
   acknowledged King of Kings and Lord of Lords. We have not to serve a
   master who cannot take care of his own. To your tents, ye Philistines,
   when the God of Israel comes to the battle! Where will ye be? Your
   ranks are broken; ye flee like thin clouds before a Biscay gale! When
   God comes forth he has but by his Spirit to blow upon his enemies, and
   they fly before him, like the chaff before the wind. The Lord shall and
   the Lord will; who, then, shall disannul it? Though foes may hoot and
   fiends may howl, he will keep his word; it shall come to pass, and he
   will get to himself renown in fulfilling his own good pleasure. Having
   thus enlarged upon the heavenly comfort promised, we proceed to notice
   the:--

   II. MOURNFUL CASES FAVOURED.

   "He will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden
   of the Lord. "Now are there not to be found in the visible Church
   persons whose character is here vividly depicted? I think there are
   three sorts of people in such a case, to all of whom I trust the
   blessing will come. There are those who once were fruitful, but are now
   comparable to wastes. If God should visit his Church, he will be
   pleased to comfort the waste places. Do I not address some who must
   needs recognise their own portrait? You used to be church members, and
   then you did seem to run well; what did hinder you? You were,
   apparently, brave soldiers once, but you deserted and went over to the
   enemy. Still, if you are the Lord's people, one of the signs of God's
   grace to his Church will be the recovery of backsliders. I remember one
   Monday afternoon, when we had been waiting upon the Lord in prayer ever
   since seven o'clock in the morning, that there came a most remarkable
   wave of prayer over the assembly. And then two backsliders got up and
   prayed, one after the other. According to their own account, they had
   been very bad fellows indeed, and had sorely transgressed against God;
   but there they were, broken-hearted and fairly broken down. It was a
   sight to make angels rejoice as their tears flowed. Certainly their
   sobs and cries touched the hearts of all of us who were assembled. I
   thought to myself, "Then God is blessing us, for when backsliders come
   back it is a proof that God has visited his people." You recollect when
   it was that Naomi returned to Israel with Ruth, her daughter-in-law.
   They never came back during the time of famine; they stopped in Moab
   then, but they came back when they heard that the Lord had visited his
   people in giving them bread. Even then Naomi said, "Call me not Naomi."
   She seemed to come back from her exile groaning and full of bitterness,
   and yet she came back because God was with his people. Backsliders,
   come back, come now, for God is with his Church, and he has promised to
   comfort her waste places. Oh! you who have forgotten your Lord,
   remember your first Husband! It was better with you then than now.
   Though you have gone astray, yet the Lord saith, "Return, thou
   backsliding Israel, for I am married unto you, saith the Lord." You may
   break the marriage bond with God, but he will not break it with you. He
   claims that he is married to you, and he bids you return to him. I hope
   that some backslider will be encouraged by this promise to return, with
   full purpose of heart, to the God of his salvation.

   Then a second department of the promise is, "He will make her
   wilderness like Eden." I take the wilderness here to be a place of
   scanty vegetation. The Oriental wildernesses are not altogether barren
   sand, but there is a feeble herbage which struggles for existence. We
   are told, you recollect, that "Moses kept his father's sheep in the
   wilderness." Oh! how many there are in the Church of God who are just
   like that! They are Christians, but sorry Christians they are. They do
   love the Lord Jesus Christ, but it is with a moonlight love, cold, very
   cold, and chill. They have light, but it is dim and hazy. If they do
   anything for Christ, their service is scanty; their contribution mean;
   their charity grudging. They bring him no sweet cane with money. They
   do not fill him with the fat of their sacrifices, but they make him to
   serve with their sins, and they weary him with their iniquities. Ah!
   dear friend, if thou art indeed a child of God, then there is this
   comfort for thee. We will make her wilderness like Eden. Even you who
   have borne so little for God shall yet be visited, and made fruitful
   when the Lord comforts his people.

   A third character is implied in the desert--the deserted places where
   no man dwells, where the traveller does not care to linger :How many
   professors of religion, how many who attend our chapels, answer to this
   description of the soil! They are like deserts. You not only never did
   bring forth fruit, but you never concerned yourself to do so. No man
   seems to care for you, and you appear to yourselves as though you were
   like the sand, which it would be a hopeless task to plough, for the
   gleaner would never fill his hand from the produce, much less the
   reaper his bosom with the sheaves. Ah! well, but God has a word for
   these desert souls. He will make her desert like the garden of the
   Lord. I pray--nay, I know--that during the gracious season which God
   has given us we shall see many a desert heart made to blossom like the
   rose. These be they whom the Lord will specially
   transform--backsliders, scanty Christians, and those who have often
   heard, but never yet proved the power of the gospel at all.

   Ask ye now, what does the Lord say he will do for them? He says (hear
   it and marvel!) that he will make the wilderness like Eden. You know
   what Eden was. It was the garden of the earth in the days of primeval
   purity. Fruit and flower, lofty tree, and lively vegetation abounded
   there in profuse luxuriance. I know not how its groves and shrubberies
   were tenanted by graceful creatures and lovely birds, but I can well
   imagine that every sense of man was regaled by its unfailing charms. No
   thorns or thistles cursed the soil, no sweating brow with arduous toll
   forced the crops from barren sods. The land laughed with plenty. The
   river, branching into many heads, watered the garden. God himself was
   pleased to water it with the mists, and to make the fruits grow, to
   swell in rich abundance, and early come to mature perfection. So the
   Lord says that when he visits his Church he will make these poor
   backsliders, these immature Christians, these nominal professors, like
   Eden. Oh! that the Lord would do it! Oh! that he would make them
   healthy, fruitful, prolific in fruitfulness, and spontaneously
   fruit-bearing, so that we should almost have need to say, "Hold, Lord!"
   just as Moses and Aaron did when the people brought in the offerings
   for the Tabernacle, until there were more than enough. Oh! that the
   Church of Christ may be enriched with all spiritual gifts, with all
   heavenly graces, with all that can minister to the welfare of the
   saints, to the advantage of the world, and to the glory of him who
   created and redeemed us! God grant it may be so!

   Moreover, as if to strengthen the volume of his grace and our hope, he
   says that he will make her desert like the garden of the Lord. He shall
   come to you and delight your heart and soul with his converse. If ever
   you should be an Eden, you shall be like to Paradise for a yet higher
   reason, because your fellowship shall be with the Father and with his
   Son, Jesus Christ. There shall be upon you the smell of a field that
   the Lord hath blessed. The Lord shall water his Church, shall water it
   every moment. He shall make fat our bones, and cause us to be as a
   watered garden, as a well of water whose waters fail not. Oh! some of
   you may well envy those happy days you once enjoyed! Would you like
   them back again? Then plead with God the promise of the text. You were
   once blessed with nearness to, and communion with, Christ. You once
   prayed with fervour, and your souls prospered. Go to God with this
   promise and say, "Lord, I am a desert; I am a wilderness; I am a waste
   place; but comfort thy Church, and let me partake of the consolation by
   making me fruitful in every good word, and work to thy glory!" The Lord
   will do it, for the promises of God shall certainly be fulfilled.

   Who but Jehovah himself can do this? I have already noted this. "He
   will make her wilderness like Eden." It is he only that can perform it.
   The minister cannot. The Church cannot, with all her efforts. Talk of
   getting up a revival! It were insufferable arrogance to make the
   attempt. It belongeth not to us to do this. Unto the Lord our God alone
   doth this belong. "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith
   the Lord." If he will but visit his Church, then we shall see the
   wilderness rejoice, but if not, we may plough, as is our duty, and we
   may work upon it, as is our calling, but there shall be no joy and no
   rejoicing. We conclude with the view of:--

   III. CERTAIN DESIRABLE RESULTS WHICH ARE PREDICTED.

   "Joy and gladness shall be found therein; thanksgiving and the voice of
   melody." You notice the doubles. The parallelism of Hebrew poetry,
   perhaps, necessitated them. Still. I am prone to remember how John
   Bunyan says that "all the flowers in God's garden bloom double." We are
   told of "manifold mercies," that is, mercies which are folded up one in
   another, so that you may unwrap them and find a fresh mercy enclosed in
   every fold. Here we have "joy and gladness, thanksgiving and the voice
   of melody." Just so; the Psalmist tells us of our soul being satisfied
   with "marrow and fatness"--two things. Elsewhere he speaks of
   "loving-kindness and tender mercy"--two things again. The Lord
   multiplies his grace. He is always slow to anger, but he is always
   lavish of his grace. See here, then, God will give his people an
   overflowing joy, an inexpressible joy, a sort of double joy, as though
   he would give them more joy than they could hold--joy and then
   gladness--, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.

   Oh! what a delightful thing must a, visitation from God be to his
   Church! Without God, all she can do is to groan. Nay, she will not
   always do that. She sometimes indulges a foolish conceit, and says, "I
   am rich and increased in goods, and have need of nothing." After that
   will Soon be heard the hooting of dragons and the cry of owls. Let God
   visit his Church, and there is sure to be thanksgiving and the voice of
   melody. It has been remarked that all revivals of true religion in
   ancient as well as modern times have been attended by revival of
   psalmody and song. The joy that makes the heart grateful, enlivens the
   spirits, and diffuses happiness, will seek and must find some tuneful
   strains. Not to speak of the Hebrew Psalter or of the Greek Hymnals, in
   Luther's day his translation of the Psalms and his chorales did more,
   perhaps, to make the Reformation popular than even his preaching, for
   the ploughman at his field-labour, and the housewife at the cradle,
   would sing one of Luther's Psalms; so, too, in our own country, in
   Wycliffe's day, fresh psalms and hymns were scattered all over the
   land. And you know how, in the last century, Wesley and Whitefield gave
   a new impetus to congregational singing. The hymns were printed on
   little fly-sheets after each sermon, and at length these units swelled
   into a volume. Collections and selections of hymns were published. So
   fond, indeed, were the Methodists of singing, that it became a taunt
   and a by-word to speak of them as canting Psalm-singers. But this is
   the mark of a revived church everywhere. New impetus is given to the
   service of song. When the Bridegroom is gone we may well mourn and
   fast, and hang our harps on the willows; it is when the Bridegroom
   cometh that joy and feasting seek the aid of vocal music, and the
   people of God break forth into thanksgiving with the voice of melody. I
   do fervently hope, beloved, that we shall have this thanksgiving, and
   this voice of melody in our midst for many a day to come! Would God
   that all the churches enjoyed it! Need I say that from all parts of the
   country there are, tokens of it now? We do not desire at any time a
   monopoly of blessing. May every Christian denomination and every
   Christian community be favoured with the dew of heaven, and have their
   roots watered by that river which is full of water. Oh! that all the
   Churches of Christ were fruitful! Instead of wishing any of them to be
   weak, I would say, with Moses, "Would God that all the Lord's people
   were prophets," and that the Lord would put his Spirit upon them! Oh!
   that Jesus might be extolled from the uttermost parts of the earth to
   the highest heavens! Brethren, let us ask God to fulfil this promise to
   the Church at large. Let us say to him, "Lord, comfort thy Zion! She
   has many waste places--comfort her! Thou knowest she has many barren
   spots--turn them into gardens of the Lord! Oh! let the heavenly rain
   descend, and the divine dew come from thee, that the wilderness and the
   solitary place may yet be glad!"

   But what shall I say to those of you who are not saved? If you want to
   become as these gardens of the Lord, it is only the grace of God which
   bringeth salvation that can work in you this mighty change. Look to the
   Lord. He it is who must do it. He hears prayer. A negro was once sent
   by his master on an errand that did not suit him; he did not want to
   go. So when he came to a river he turned back, and said, "Master, I
   came to a river; and I could not swim across it." "Well, but was there
   not a ferryboat?" "Yes, there was a ferry-boat, but the man was on the
   other side." "Well," said the master, "did you call to the ferry-man to
   come and take you across?" No; he did not think of doing that, for, as
   he did not wish to go over, he was glad to find an excuse. Now it is
   true, sinner, that you cannot save yourself, but there is One who can.
   There is a ferry-boat and there is a Ferry-man. Cry to him! Cry to him,
   "Master, across this river be pleased to take me; I cannot swim it, but
   thou canst bear me over it. Oh! do for me what I cannot do for myself.
   Make me to be accepted in the Beloved!" If you seek the Lord, he will
   be found of you. He never did set a soul a-seeking but what he meant to
   bless it. But if you will not seek, what should be said of you but that
   on your head should lie your own blood? I know many of you to be
   greatly impressed this week. I hope the impression will not be blown
   away, like smoke out of a chimney. May God make a deep work in your
   souls! Oh! some of you were easily impressed, but you quite as easily
   forgot the impression. You are like Ephraim's cake that was baked on
   one side; you do not get thoroughly cooked. You do not feel the power
   of the gospel permeating your whole nature in every part. You are like
   a cake not turned, and God accepts you not because of this. Oh! that
   there might be a thorough work of the Spirit in your souls, a work of
   grace that should bring you to Jesus to be rooted and built up in him
   and established in the faith, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
   Amen.

                              The Fruits of Grace

   A Sermon

   (No. 3515)

   Published on Thursday, June 8th, 1916.

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   At [23]the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington.

   On Lord's day Evening, January 21st, 1872.

   "In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language
   of Canaan, and swear to the Lord of hosts; one shall be called the city
   of destruction. In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the
   midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the
   Lord. And it all be for a sign and for a witness unto the Lord of hosts
   in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the
   oppressors, and he shall send them a Saviour, and a great one, and he
   shall deliver them. And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the
   Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and
   oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it. And
   the Lord shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall
   return even to the Lord, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall
   heal them. In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to
   Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into
   Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians. In that day
   shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even blessing in
   the midst of the land: whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying,
   Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the, work of my hands, and
   Israel mine inheritance."--Isaiah 19:18-25.

   THIS is a very remarkable prophecy. Attempts have been made to explain
   it, as if it were already fulfilled. I believe all such attempts to be
   utter failures. This promise stands on record to be, fulfilled at some
   future day In those bright days for which some of us are looking, when
   the knowledge of the Lord shall cover the earth, so the waters cover
   the sea, then shall this word to Egypt be verified; yea, and God shall
   be glorified both by Egypt and Assyria, as well as in the land of
   Israel. This ought to be an encouragement to carry on missionary
   operations with great vigour. Here is a distinct promise for Assyria
   and for Egypt. Let not the missionary be afraid, even if for thousands
   of years to come there should be little apparent success to the
   preaching of the gospel. If the Lord should tarry another six thousand
   years, ay, sixty thousand years--and he may--we are still to go on
   working, and still to go on labouring, looking for his coming, and
   expecting it, but not relaxing our efforts because he pleases to delay
   it, for the Lord has sworn that all flesh shall know his glory, and you
   may depend upon it, there is no spot of earth that shall be left to be
   Satan's dominion. It shall be conquered for Christ, and in truth he
   shall "see of the travail of his soul, and he shall be satisfied." It
   is most encouraging to find Egypt mentioned. You find it in one of the
   Psalms, "Princes shall come out of Egypt, and they shall come out of
   Ethiopia." Now this I believe to be the litera1 meaning of the passage.
   You must understand that the prophecy was given to the people of
   Israel, and it was given to them, as it were, to children that were
   using types and figures. It speaks in their language. Hence it speaks
   of altars, and pillars, and oblations, all of which are to be
   understood now in the spiritual sense. The Church of God has come to
   her manhood, in which she has done with material altars and material
   oblations, seeing that she has Christ to be her only altar, her only
   priest, and prayer and praise to be the spiritual oblation which she
   shall bring. I understand the prophecy to be, in brief, just this. In
   the latter day, Egypt will be converted, and Assyria too, and wonders
   of grace will be performed in that land, and the people of the land
   shall with delight worship the Most High.

   Having said this, I am now going to use the text for another purpose.
   Here is a wonderful display of the grace of God in this promise to
   Egypt. I see the very heart of God revealed. I see a display of what
   God will do, not to Egypt only, but to others also, and though we have
   much to say, we will try to open up, in as few particulars as we can
   make them, the display of grace which God gives among the sons of men.
   We begin thus:--

   I. THE GRACE OF GOD OFTEN COMES TO THE VERY WORST OF MEN.

   It is promised to Egypt. Now Egypt was the nation which was the type of
   God's enemies. It was over Egypt that he triumphed at the Red Sea, when
   Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord?" and we regard Egypt as always being
   typical of the enemies of God--the peculiar and chief enemies. Yet the
   grace of God is to come to Egypt. And so will it come often to the
   worst enemies that God has. Saul of Tarsus, foaming at the mouth with
   rage against the Christ of God, was met and conquered by eternal love,
   and his heart was renewed, and he was made an apostle. And oftentimes
   since then, electing love has chosen those that were most furious
   against Christ, and the power of the Holy Spirit has come upon them,
   and turned the lions into lambs, and made them lie down at the feet of
   the Saviour. Let us have hope for the worst of men, and let the worst
   of men have hope for themselves under the gospel of Jesus Christ. The
   Egyptians were a peculiarly debased people as to their idolatry. If you
   go into the British Museum you will still see the cats, the crocodiles,
   the scarlet ibis, which they were accustomed to worship. Besides that,
   it was one of the sarcasms of the Roman poets that the Egyptians
   worshipped gods which they grew in their own gardens. They had the
   sacred beetle, the sacred mouse, and I know not what. And yet, degraded
   as they were by idolatry, the grace of God was to come to them. And men
   may have gone far into superstition; they may have debased even their
   own intellect by what they have tried to believe, and forced themselves
   down into the very deeps of superstition, and yet, for all that, the
   grace of God can come to them and lift them up. And the Egyptian were
   degraded politically too, for we read in one passage of the prophets
   that Egypt shall be the basest of all nations; and yet, though the
   basest of nations in that respect, the grace of God shall coma to them.
   Oh! how wondrous is the sovereignty of God! The devil cannot dye a soul
   so scarlet in sin but what the blood of Christ can make it white as
   snow. Satan cannot drive a chosen sheep of Christ so far on the
   mountains of vanity, or into the deserts of sin, but what the great
   Shepherd of the sheep can find that sheep, and bring it back again.
   There is hope for the mart sunken. There is hope for those that grovel,
   and that sink in the mire The infinite compassion of God can reach
   them, and the eternal power of God can lift them up.

   But there is one singular note in the text, that one of the cities in
   that land of Egypt (if I read the text aright) that was to be saved was
   called the City of Destruction. It had come to be named by that name,
   and yet, think of that, God looked upon it with mercy. Now there are in
   villages, and there are in towns, and certainly there are in London,
   men that have become so notorious for every sort of vice and sin that
   they are only known as the devil's own servants; and if anybody in the
   place were to speak of them, it would be with no question about the
   horrible condition of their minds and the state of their character. And
   yet in how many cases has the Lord been pleased to make such beings,
   new men in Christ Jesus! I have some in my mind's eye now, who have
   been to me a source of unutterable joy, whose characters were known,
   and certainly not admired. They were the dread of all with whom they
   dwelt. I remember one whose fist had many a time laid low his
   adversary, and whose oaths, and cursings, and songs at midnight often
   made the village tremble when he was filled with drink. But what a
   humble child he became when at last the gospel brought him down! How
   changed and how quiet was his manner when Jesus Christ had renewed his
   soul--something like John Bunyan with his drink and his Sabbath
   breakings--but what a saint was he when bowed at his Saviour's feet, he
   found his sins forgiven! We must not say, "Our children are hopeful,
   and God will save them, but we cannot expect him to look upon the
   fallen and degraded." Ah! if, is Pharisaism that would make us speak
   so. The gospel has found some of its brightest jewels in the lowest
   haunts of vice. Bear it, bear it into the caves of darkness, where the
   blackness seems to be palpable, and to hang like the glooms of
   death--bear ye aloft the everlasting torch, which the divine Lord
   himself has kindled, and you shall discover by its light some precious
   blood--redeemed ones, who shall be to the praise of the glory of his
   grace. "One shall be called the City of Destruction, but thus saith the
   Lord, I have delivered it, I will save it, for my name's sake."

   Now this ought to be very encouraging to every hearer present, for
   where there is mercy proclaimed to the chief of sinners, there is
   encouragement to every form of sinner to come humbly to the heavenly
   Father, and plead the precious blood of Jesus, and obtain life and
   peace. God grant we may be led there for his name's sake! But now the
   second observation is that grace is displayed in our text from the fact
   that:--

   II. GOD'S GRACE SENDS A SAVIOUR.

   Note, too, that he adds this word, "A GREAT ONE, and he shall deliver
   them." Beloved friends, you know, all of you, what I have to say, but
   yet, though you know it, I know no story ever make score glad your
   spirit than the old, old story of the Saviour. He that has same to save
   us is Jesus, the Son of God; to save us from every stain of sin; to
   save us from our propensity to sin, from the power of our habits, and
   from the snares of Satan. He has come to save us from the death
   eternal, to save us from the wrath to come. God has sent us a Saviour.
   We could not have saved ourselves, but one has come who can. The text
   says that Saviour is a great one. Oh! I wanted a great Saviour. A
   little Saviour would not have answered my turn, for great sin wanted a
   great atonement, and my hard heart wanted great grace to soften it
   down. Now he that came to save us was God himself--Jesus--nothing less
   than God--counting it not robbery to be equal with God. He is great in
   his nature, for as God he is infinite--omnipotent. He is great also in
   what he has done. Look to him on the cross; it is the Son of God
   pouring out his life for sinners that they may live through his death.
   There most be great merit in such a sacrifice. I never dare believe in
   any limited merit in Christ. He who gave himself there upon the cross,
   being very God of very God, though certainly man--there can be no limit
   set to the value of the atonement which he made. Oh! beloved, it is a
   great Saviour that God gives. And now that he has risen from the dead,
   he stands before God to plead for us, and it is no little plea--no plea
   which might be put back or put off. With authority he pleads before his
   Father's throne, points to his own wounds, and the Father's heart
   always yields to the Son's intercession. You have a great Saviour, for
   he is a great pleader. And, besides that, all power is in his hands;
   the keys of death and hell are at his girdle, and the government shall
   be upon his shoulders, and his name shall be called Wonderful,
   Counsellor, the Mighty God. Oh! what a Saviour we have! Dare we doubt
   him? When we cast ourselves upon him, is there not an end to all our
   fears, for Jesus is mighty to save,

   And what a word that is in the text?"a Saviour and a great one, and he
   shall deliver them"! God did not send Christ at a haphazard. Jesus did
   not come here to save those who might perchance be saved--to make men
   salvable, but he will save all he came to save. Those on whom he fixed
   his eye of everlasting love, for whom the precious drops were
   shed--these he will, by the power of his arm, pluck from the jaws of
   the lion, because, with the blood of his heart he had redeemed them.
   "He shall deliver them." Oh! you that trust in Jesus, lay this word
   home. May the Spirit of God lay it home to you. He shall deliver them
   from all temptation, from all trial, from all affliction, from death
   itself. "He shall deliver them."

   Now put the two points together. We have mentioned that the grace of
   God comes to the greatest of sinners, and it brings to them a Saviour,
   and a great one, and I have laid open to you something of the heart of
   God in the greatness of his compassion. But we must pass on. Where the
   grace of God comes, it seems from the text that:--

   III. IT CHANGES MEN'S LANGUAGE.

   Turn to the 18th verse. "In that day shall five cities in the land of
   Egypt speak the language of Canaan"--the spiritual meaning of which is
   that the grace of God shall make men speak that holy and pure language
   which is the mark of a child of God. O dear hearer, if the grace of God
   ever meets with you, your friends will know it--every one--by your
   conversation. That man could not speak without an oath; there will be
   no oath now. When he did speak, it was in a proud, boastful, hectoring
   way about himself. Ah! you will hardly know him to be the same man; for
   he will speak so humbly and so gently, and when he comes to speak about
   himself he will have the tears in his eyes to think of what he used to
   be, and what the grace of God has done for him now. Then his language
   would be lascivious and unclean at times, but now he desires not even
   to hear of such things, much less to mention them; for it is a shame
   for a Christian to speak of the things which are done by many in
   secret. The grace of God soon rinses out a man's mouth. His wife knows
   it; his children know it; his workfolk know it; and though some of them
   will think him a fool to speak after the way in which he now does
   though he does not imitate the language of Christians, and is not a
   cant, yet there is something about his very brogue and talk that might
   make men say, "Thou also west with Jesus of Nazareth, for thy speech
   betrayeth thee." Oh! would not it be a mercy if God would change the
   speech of some in London! Even our boys in the streets sometimes talk
   in a way that is enough to make your blood chill. Foul words are very
   common in our streets and elsewhere. O sovereign grace, come and visit
   these, and they shall speak no longer the language of Babylon and the
   language of Belial, but they shall speak the language of Canaan, for
   God shall give them a pure language. When you hear men that once could
   curse begin to pray, when those who were given to blasphemies begin to
   pray, and when, instead of hearing the noise of strife in the
   working-man's house, you hear the song of praise, then is fulfilled the
   saying that is written, "In that day shall five cities speak the
   language of Canaan. and swear to the Lord of Hosts." But I must pass
   on. Where the grace of God comes:--

   IV. IT SETS MEN ON HOLY SERVICE.

   "There shall be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of
   :Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord. "When a man is
   in sin he worships himself, or he serves his pleasure and Satan; but
   when the grace of God comes, the man begins at once to serve God, and
   becomes God's servant. I am sure I know houses now that have an altar
   to God in them--the family altar--where you would not have thought such
   a thing could ever have been. I know some, too, that will this very day
   give of their substance to God, who two or three years ago would have
   scorned the act. They would have said it was a waste of money
   altogether to give anything to the cause of the Most High. There are
   some teaching at the Sabbath school, and spending the day of rest in,
   perhaps, the hardest toil of the week, and doing it very cheerfully
   too, who once would have laughed to scorn any proposal that they should
   have done any such thing. But the Lord, when he gets men's hearts, and
   washes away their sins, takes them into his service, and males those
   who were most ready to serve Satan become most willing to serve him. Is
   not this true--I appeal to many here present--is it not your delight
   now to do all you can for the Lord Jesus Christ? Perhaps, however,
   while you say "Yes," you also add, "But I do not do half as much as I
   should, nor as I ought. "You feel precisely as I also felt--and I must
   make the same confession as yourself. But, brothers and sisters, do not
   let it end in confession. Let us wake up and do more; for the love that
   saved us, the love that bought us at such a price, ought not to be
   recompensed so poorly as it has been. And let us pray for the grace of
   God, that we may ever have an altar in our own hearts, and be ourselves
   the sacrifice--that our whole life may be a life of consecration to the
   living God. Oh! that our common dress might be as priestly vestment,
   and our ordinary meals as sacraments, and ourselves as priests unto the
   living God; our whole life a psalm, and our whole being a hallelujah to
   the Most High! Where the grace of God comes with power, it makes the
   worst of men become the boss, and the lowest of the low become true
   servants of the living God. "Can it be?" says one; "can I ever be a
   servant of God" Ah! yes: hark to the song of heaven! "We have washed
   our robes"--then they needed washing--"and made them white in the blood
   of the Lamb, Glory be to him who hath made us kings and priests unto
   our God."

   The next display of divine grace in the text is to be seen in this,
   that where the grace of God comes:--

   V. IT TEACHES MEN TO PRAY.

   We read in the 20th verse, "They shall cry unto the Lord because of
   oppressors." This is a kind of prayer that only God can teach us. You
   can easily learn to say a form of prayer, or to read one from a book,
   but a prayer that can fairly be called a cry is the fruit of grace. The
   cry is the natural expression of distress. There is no hypocrisy in a
   cry. When one is sore sick and ready to die, and cries out in anguish,
   it is the genuine expression of an oppressed spirit. And God always
   teaches his children to pray such prayers an those. And oh! how sweetly
   will saved souls pray next to the songs of angels, I think the prayers
   of new converts are among the sweetest things that ever reach our ears.
   When we have been a long time professors, we are very apt to get into a
   sort of stilted mode of talking to God in prayer, and men that have
   more gifts than graces will spend the time in words, words, words. But
   oh! how has my heart leaped when I have heard a cry, such as "God, be
   merciful to me, a sinner!" when some soul, ready to burst with fear of
   the wrath to come, has cried out, "Jesus, Lord, have mercy upon me!" or
   when some heart that has just found Jesus has praised and magnified the
   exceeding mercy that has put away its sin. Christ can teach the
   blasphemer to pray; he can take the profane into his school, and teach
   them all to cry, and what all the clergy and ministry in the land could
   not do, namely, teach a man to pray one sincere prayer, God the Holy
   Ghost can do to the very offscouring and the scum of the universe, when
   once he comes to deal with them in the way of grace. Wonders of grace
   to God belong. He that teaches us to pray will teach us to praise him
   in heaven. The soul that lisps out its desires sincerely to God shall
   one day sing with cherubim and seraphim before the eternal throne. But
   I must hasten on. Where grace comes:--

   VI. IT INSTRUCTS MEN.

   We learn this from the next verse, "And the Lord shall be known in
   Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day." It is a very
   serious evil with many hearers that they are altogether ignorant of the
   things of God; but it is delightful to observe how sweetly the Holy
   Spirit can teach. I have spoken lately with some whom God has called by
   his grace during the past few weeks, and I have been surprised that,
   although they had never been Bible readers, nor received any religious
   instruction in their youth, when the grace of God showed them their
   sin, he did it thoroughly, and when he showed them the Saviour, he did
   it in a wondrous way, so that when they came to read the Bible it was
   not difficult to them to understand it, nor to lay hold upon it with
   delight, and some have become well instructed in the things of the
   kingdom in a very short time indeed. There is no teacher like the Holy
   Spirit! "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord," and when he
   teaches they are taught indeed. What boots it to a man to know all
   earthly knowledge if he knows not his God? But where grace comes, the
   man is no longer a stranger to the Lord; he knows the Father, the Son,
   the Spirit. He must know the Father, for he has become a child. He must
   know the Son, for he is his only confidence. He must know the Spirit,
   for it is the Spirit that dwelleth in him, and hath renewed him. Oh!
   that God would be pleaded to-night to take some fresh scholars into his
   school! Don't say, "I am poor and illiterate." What matters that? With
   the Lord to teach you, you will make an apt scholar. We can only teach
   your ears; he can teach your hearts. We can only write the copy in a
   book, but he can write it on the fleshy tablets of your souls. Never
   despair of being instructed in the things of heaven. The Lord can
   graciously instruct you, and if he leads you to-night to receive the
   Saviour--the great one--he will begin the divine teaching which will
   end in your being complete in Christ, and your entering into his glory.
   I want you to notice a little more. Where the grace of God comes into a
   man's heart:--

   VII. IT MAKES EVEN TROUBLE A BLESSING TO HIM

   Read the 22nd verse. "The Lord shall smite Egypt"--there is the
   trouble-"he shall smite"--there is the trouble again-"and heal
   it"--there is the mercy--"and they shall return even to the Lord, and
   he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them." An ungodly man
   when he is in trouble, has nothing whatever to sustain him, and no good
   comes out of the trouble. But get the heart renewed, and let the man
   receive the Saviour, and perhaps the greatest mercies he has are those
   which are blessings in disguise. I read a story the other day--an
   incident which happened to a City Missionary. He was preaching one
   night out in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and there was a man--an extremely
   aged man, who had lost his wife, and lived in a garret alone. He had
   scarcely a rag upon him and was nearly starved, and he was going out to
   commit suicide, but, moved by curiosity, he listened to the preaching
   of the gospel, and it saved his soul. It turned out that he had once
   been worth £100,000, and had been a distinguished merchant, but had
   lost his all in a foolish speculation, and had come down from the
   heights of riches to the lowest poverty, and at an extreme age he found
   Christ. The missionary found him friends who kept him with about enough
   to keep body and soul together--a humble crust in a very lowly,
   solitary room--but he used to say that now he had found the Lord; but
   he might never have found him if he had not lost all his wealth, and he
   looked upon it as the greatest blessing that had ever occurred to him,
   that he was brought to such beggary, that he was able and willing to
   stand in the street to listen to a sermon; for he said that in his
   riches he had despised the gospel, and had been altogether an atheist
   and an unbeliever but now, when brought to the lowest, Christ had found
   him, and he had more happiness with his cross than he had with his
   wealth. Oh! get the grace of God in your heart, and then broken limbs
   will be a bleeding. That long depression of trade that brought you oft
   low will appear a very different thing now. Your lot is very lowly now
   perhaps, and your toils severe, but God's grace will gild all these
   dark things in such a way that you shall even learn to glory in
   tribulation also, and bless the Lord that he did not leave you to be a
   stranger to him, but made you his child and, therefore, made you feel
   his rod for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not? Beloved,
   what a blessing it is to have the grace of God, seeing it turns adverse
   circumstances into true prosperity and makes our losses to be our
   lasting gains! One other reflection, and that is this concerning the
   grace of God:--

   VIII. IT CHANGES THE RELATIONS OF MEN ONE TO ANOTHER.

   Read the 23rd verse. "In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt
   to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian
   into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians." Now
   the Egyptians and the Assyrians were enemies to one another; they were
   always fighting. There was a bloody feud and war between them century
   after century; but when the grace of God shall visit them both, there
   shall be no more fighting; the Egyptian shall go and visit the
   Assyrian, and the Assyrian shall visit the Egyptian. Have you never met
   with a case? Two brothers were at enmity, and would not speak to each
   other. One of them was saved by grace, and he thought, "Oh! if my
   brother John might be converted!" He wanted to fall into his brother's
   arms and make it all up, and be friends again. Meanwhile, brother John
   had heard the gospel somewhere else, and his soul had been saved, and
   he goes to find out the other brother, and all are reconciled, and the
   families that had been at a distance are knit together in love. Oh! the
   gospel soon breaks down barriers. I won't give a penny for your
   religion if you are at enmity with anybody--if you can say of anyone of
   your kith and kin, "I will never speak to them again." Mind, in that
   day when you appear before God, how can you expect mercy? Well, now,
   genuine grace makes us forgive as we have been forgiven, and it
   establishes intercommunications between those who had long been enemies
   to one another. Should there happen to be in this place at this time
   any that have long been at variance, I believe that there is no way of
   establishing a lasting love between you like your both loving Jesus
   Christ. If you cannot meet anywhere else, you are sure to meet if you
   come to the cross. A common Saviour will hind you together. Bought with
   the same blood, and filled with tile same divine life, you will become
   members of the same mystical body; you cannot help loving each other.
   Oh! that God would put an end in the world to all wars between nations,
   as well as all strifes between individuals. It won't come about by
   trade, nor yet be politics, nor by anything of man's devising; but if
   the gospel spreads, if God converts Egypt and converts Assyria, then
   Egypt will not desire war with Asia, nor Assyria with Egypt, but they
   shall be one in Christ Jesus the Lord. Wonders of grace! wonders of
   grace, that those that hated should love, and enemies should become
   friends. We will close with these last words. Where the grace of God
   comes:--

   IX. IT MAKES MEN TO BE BLESSED, AND TO BE A BLESSING.

   You will find that affirmed in the last two verses. "They shall be a
   blessing in the midst of the land, and it shall be said, Blessed be
   Egypt, my people." The man that was accursed before, and was a curse,
   becomes blessed, and is a blessing. I will not enlarge upon it, but I
   will say this to you, the members of the church. It has delighted me to
   find the many earnest hearts there are here that are trying, to do
   good, some in one way, and some in another. I would in every case, if
   my encouragement were worth your having, give it you very heartily.
   But, beloved, if I do not know of it, and if no one knows of it but
   yourself and God, go on, go on. It is God's work to save souls, and you
   are workers together with him. Oh! this city wants you--wants ten
   thousand earnest spirits. The lodging-houses want you; the alleys and
   the courts want you; the poor want you; the rich want you. If you have
   anything to say of the remedy which wisdom has prepared for the remedy
   of sins disease, the millions want it. They won't come to hear the
   gospel presaged, take it to their houses, carry it to their doors. If
   they reject a Saviour, let it not he for want of your hunting after
   them. Push it in their way. Sow beside all waters. In season and out of
   season teach ye the Word. Ye know not where God may bless you. But
   never be discouraged because of the badness of the neighbourhood, or
   the lowness of the character of the people. If Egypt shall be saved,
   have faith for this Egypt. If Assyria shall be saved, have confidence
   in God for those who are often worse than heathens, and you shall have
   your reward in that day when he of the pierced hand shall distribute
   crowns to those who faithfully serve him. Rewards, not of debt, but of
   grace, shall be given to the most obscure and unknown of you, who for
   his sake have sought to teach little children or to reclaim the adult
   who had fallen into sin. Take courage--your work of faith and labour of
   love are not in vain in the Lord, and will do wonders yet to the praise
   of his grace. And as to you that are not saved. I have been saying
   great things of encouragement to you. I don't know who may take hold of
   them, but if there were one here who should reckon himself to be quite
   out of hope, it is to that man I spoke; and if there is a man here who
   says. "You don't mean me; you don't know my character," I will suppose
   it to be the worst character that was ever heard of--I meant you. He is
   "able to save unto the uttermost than that come unto God by him." "All
   manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men." Seek ye the
   Lord! Confess your sins to him. Weep out your confession with your head
   on your Father's bosom and say, "Forgive me, forgive me for thy Son's
   sake," and it shall be done unto you. God grant it may be done, even
   now: for his name's sake! Amen.

Love and Jealousy

   (No. 3516)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY JUNE 15, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave." Song of
   Solomon 8:6.

   TAKEN in its most natural sense, this is certainly true of creature
   love. It is a mighty, all-constraining, irresistible passion. Even the
   love of friendship occasionally has proved itself to be "strong as
   death." "Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life
   for his friend." There have been those who were willing to sacrifice
   their lives for their friends. Filial affection has sometimes proven to
   be more than a match for the terrors of the grave. Some pleasing
   instances are on record worthy to be written among the golden deeds of
   manhood in which brothers and sisters have seemed to contend with each
   other who should die first, if perchance a brother's precious life
   might, by such a sacrifice, be preserved. What a mighty instinct of
   love glows in the mother's heart! You recollect that famous story of
   the mother whose child was taken from her by a Jesuit missionary to be
   trained separate and apart from its parents--how she swam through
   rivers and passed through what seemed to be impenetrable forests,
   guided only by the midnight star--till she arrived at the place where
   her offspring was--braving death in a thousand shapes from wild beasts
   and venomous serpents, from floods and jungles, from fierce men and
   relentless persecutors, might she but reach her child! Have there not
   been instances where, in the stormy blasts of winter, a mother has
   wrapped her garments about her infant and, exposing herself to the fury
   of the elements, has sacrificed her own life that the little one might
   live? Love has, indeed, often proved itself to be strong as death! When
   merely the common passion which burns in the breast of ordinary men and
   women towards each other, it has asserted its strength in a fond
   devotion which reckoned no consequences, spared itself no pain and
   fixed no limit to endurance, not counting life, itself, too dear to be
   parted with on so high a service.

   Nor do we lack painful proofs of the converse proposition as it is
   stated in the second clause of our text. Jealousy has often proved
   itself "cruel as the grave." You have only to recall the most appalling
   murders that have been committed within your memory, or, if you please,
   those you have read of in the history of nations, and you will find
   that jealousy has instigated those that were most vindictive and
   relentless. When jealousy begins to turn its sharp tooth upon a man's
   heart, his reason fails him. Madness takes possession of his faculties.
   A determined purpose, which he would not have dared to contemplate
   under the influence of a well-balanced judgment, prompts, plans and
   performs almost without premeditation, an atrocious crime, when
   jealousy rules the cruel hour! We believe it and we deplore it! No
   revenge has ever been found too bitter, too malicious, too lawless for
   jealousy to inflict. Relentless as the grave, it spares not youth nor
   beauty, respects not fame nor fortune, but accounts all comers for its
   prey!

   Not that these things, a phenomena of Nature, much concern the
   Christian minister. He has to handle these themes because they concern
   you as men. It is to men he speaks. He has to tell them of the
   salvation of Jesus Christ! It is rather the business of the mental
   philosopher than the faithful Evangelist to take up these phenomena of
   the human mind. Our business is to understand these things spiritually
   This Song of Songs is spiritual, or else it has no claim on our
   attention--its very Inspiration were incredible. We cannot imagine the
   Holy Spirit giving us this song merely for the purpose of entertaining
   us with the figures and metaphors of Eastern allegory! There must be a
   deep and hidden meaning in it.

   Now we believe it will be fair to say that there are two high spiritual
   forms of love and jealousy and that our text is lucid in its
   description of both--first, the love and jealousy of the saints with
   regard to Christ And secondly, the love and jealousy of Christ with
   regard to His saints. We will begin with--

   I. THE LOVE AND JEALOUSY OF THE SAINTS WITH REGARD TO CHRIST.

   The saints love their Lord and Master, or else they could not be
   saints. Love is the fountain of their saintship. They are sanctified by
   love. It is the love of Jesus Christ which compels them to hate sin and
   which leads them forward in the path of holiness. The Holy Spirit uses
   the same passion of love to work in us the purging of ourselves from
   every unhallowed thing and to inflame our desire after everything that
   is agreeable to the mind of Christ. The saints have received, by the
   Holy Spirit, a love to Christ which is "strong as death." And how
   strong is death? Think for a moment how strong Death is! He is so
   strong that the armies which lay encamped upon the field just now, and
   could tread an empire beneath their feet, yield to his imperial sway,
   and are, themselves, trod beneath the feet of Death. Xerxes, as he sat
   on his golden throne, wept at the thought that death should so soon mow
   down the myriads of his Persian hosts. Over all the multitudes which
   have been born into the world, with but two exceptions, Death has
   swayed his scepter. So strong is he, that he has up to now reigned as
   an Universal Monarch. Nor will he ever resign his scepter until He
   shall come whose Kingdom shall have no end--He who is, "death of death,
   and Hell's destruction." The monarchy of death is not only universal,
   but its behests are imperious and instantaneously obeyed! When, at
   God's command, death seizes the body, it has no power to resist. The
   vital energy at once ceases, the tongue of music is dumb and the hand
   of skill is motionless forever! Then shall the dust return to the earth
   as it was, and the spirit shall return to God, who gave it. In vain the
   physician's skill--it cannot avert the stroke of death. No long siege
   is necessary--it requires not years, nor months, nor weeks to scale the
   ramparts of man's citadel of bodily strength! As Death knocks at the
   door, it flies open. The arrest must be made. Willing or unwilling, the
   prisoner must go with the officer. The demand is peremptory and the
   obedience passive. Seems it not as if Nature had no parallel for this
   strong irresistible force of Death?

   Behold the love of our Lord Jesus Christ! Mark you, it is as strong as
   death! It can and it does overcome all adversaries--yes, even death
   itself! My Brothers and Sisters, it may, perhaps, strengthen your
   courage if I remind you that some of your comrades have tried their
   love in competition with death. They have "resisted unto blood,
   striving against sin." They have met with death in the most cruel
   forms. They were stoned! They were sawn in sunder! They were burned at
   the stake. They were dragged at the heels of wild horses. Think of
   Marcus of Arethusa, stung to death by wasps, or of holy Mr. Samuel,
   starved to death in his dungeon with but a mouthful of bread and a drop
   of water given him each day--only just enough to continue his lingering
   existence! And yet these persons who thus met death with no downy
   pillow to lean their heads upon and with no voice of friendship to
   comfort them, never wavered in their attachment to their Master! They
   suffered persecution, nakedness, peril and the sword--nothing could
   separate them from the love of God which was in Christ Jesus the Lord!
   Some of them met with death in the most gloomy formsas well as in the
   most cruel shapes. They were cast into lonely dungeons where it was
   almost literally true that "the moss grew upon their eyelids." Think of
   our brethren in Holland, persecuted alike by Protestants and Romanists!
   They have been despised of all men and have suffered death in deep
   desertion! They have been thrown into dungeons and left there till the
   slimy snails crawled over them, till the toads gathered about them,
   till their emaciated frames absolutely rotted and decayed in the
   nauseous places of their confinement! Not that they desired to escape,
   or sought liberty at the expense of conscience--rather did they account
   it a joy that they had fallen into divers trials for the sake of
   Christ! With none to cheer them, with no Brother's voice to help them
   to raise a tune, with no hymn to chant them on their way to public
   martyrdom--without an eye to look upon them, except the eyes of the
   Master--their love verily proved itself to have been "strong as death."

   Still worse, I think, to bear--some of them met death in the most
   lingering manner. Many a man could stand upon the burning firewood,
   endure with heroism his hour of torture and then ascend in the chariot
   of Elijah up to Heaven! But to be roasted before a slow fire, to be
   starved by a low regimen, to be crushed by a vicious atmosphere--for
   the martyrdom to extend over a week, a month, or a year--how shall this
   be endured? The Supernatural Grace of God has made a bed of spikes to
   be a bed of roses to some of the martyrs. Amidst the flames they have
   even leaped and sung for very joy! That was a grand saying of one of
   the martyr of Bloody Mary's time, who, when he was told by Bonner that
   his life would be spared if he would recant, said, "Look here, Bishop,
   if I had as many lives as I have hairs on my body, I would burn as many
   times as that before I would bend myself down before the superstitions
   of Rome!" Another of the martyrs, when his finger was put into the
   flame of a candle that he might feel what kind of peril he was about to
   encounter, told his persecutors if he had as much agony in all his body
   as he then had in his finger, he would not give up the faith which he
   had received from God, to adopt any of the traditions of men! Death has
   thus come piecemeal to a man--he has had to "die daily"--in deaths
   often like the Apostle Paul, continually having to face the grim fiend.
   The love which Jesus Christ

   has kindled in the souls of His people has been undiminished in
   quantity and undimmed in brightness. In fact, I think that the love
   which Christians have for Christ seems to flame the more vehemently,
   the more troubles that they have to endure! Have you never seen a
   chemist, when illustrating a lecture, take a small piece of solid
   matter, put it in some water, and the moment it touches the water it
   has begun to burn? In ordinary cases, contact with water extinguishes
   fire, but this substance touches the water and burns there, as it burns
   nowhere else! So seems it to be with the Christian. The best and most
   brilliant part of the Christian's love comes out under some
   overwhelming trouble. He triumphed when the opportunity arose that put
   him to the test. "Love is strong as death."

   Although you and I are not born in an age in which we are likely to
   attain to the distinguished honor of wearing the ruby crown of
   martyrdom, their example may excite our ambitions. Have you, dear young
   Friend, been subjected to a litt1e jeering and sneering in the
   workshop, or to a little harsh treatment at home? Maybe you have begun
   to falter and flag. Consider for a moment, then, what part have you in
   that love which is strong as death if it cannot bear this? If any of
   you have been sorely tempted to do an unholy thing to get out of your
   pecuniary embarrassments, ask yourselves, "Where is the love which is
   strong in death," and will you dare to stoop? If you do not maintain
   your integrity, you have not a drop of martyr's blood in you! And if
   you have not the spirit of Christ, you are none of His! When I see
   professors turn pale at a laugh of the thoughtless, or look terrified
   when some article in a newspaper or a magazine thrusts hard at their
   principles, I wonder how they would have behaved themselves in the
   grand old times of Luther? Or had they belonged to the school of which
   Calvin was the great exponent? Or might it have been their lot to
   encounter the struggles, political and social, with which such bold
   reformers as Wickliffe and Hugh Latimer were mixed up with? Let not
   worthy sons of valiant sires pander to cowardly fears! Rather, let that
   love which is as strong as death brace your nerves and replenish you
   with a Divine inspiration! Doubtless, Brothers and Sisters, we shall
   have an opportunity of testing this love, though not at the ignominious
   stake, perhaps, nor yet in the desolate prison. The average trials and
   troubles of life, the peculiar contingencies of each individual's
   career, the special besetments and temptations that pertain to a child
   of God--all these make it momentous to live--to live as becomes
   godliness! And what do you think? Can it be child's play to die? To
   finish one's course--to know that alterations and corrections cannot be
   made? Our flesh creeps at the prospect of the grave--but our soul
   trembles at the outlook and the judgment!

   Our faith must be firm and our fellowship unwavering--then our love
   will be strong--yes, as strong as death! You should not lose your
   confidence when you lose your health. The animal spirits may sink, but
   you are not dependent upon anything so contingent as they are on the
   atmosphere. The spirit that sustains you is Divine! With decay comes
   depres-sion--they are both the fruit of disease or of infirmity. Faith
   can survive--love can triumph over both--

   "Jesus can make a dying bed Feel soft as downy pillows are, While on
   His breast you lean your head And softly breathe your life out there."
   This is what Christ can do! Do you ask what He willdo? If you live to
   His praise and rest in His love, you shall find that that love is
   strong as death! Instead of its growing cooler and weaker when the
   outward man decays, that love of yours shall get to the land of Beulah
   and you shall sit upon the banks of Jordan, expecting the coming of the
   Master and singing happy canticles and blessed love songs, even in the
   prospect of your departure! Love is strong as death!

   I wish every Christian would think it over in his own mind, whether his
   love to Christ is not very poor and flat, compared with what it should
   be? It seems to me that there is a notion abroad that a Christian may
   be expected to betray weakness on other points. Is it not a fact that
   evangelical or orthodox books are far the most part written in a feeble
   style? How many devout ministers preach sound Gospel like simple
   twaddle? If you want strong commonsense, you often get more of it in
   secular than in religious periodicals! The ready pen and the forcible
   tongue are frequently employed on the wrong side. I think the idea
   prevails among pious people that everything we do for Christ ought to
   be done in a quiet, gentle, soft, milk-sop fashion--that we must pray
   in a very smooth tone of voice, speak in a whisper and sing so as not
   to shock anybody's nerves! This seems to me to be totally inconsistent
   and utterly alien to the spirit of genuine Christianity! When you
   espouse godliness you need not renounce manliness! If anything is
   fitted to develop all the energies of a man's nature and call forth all
   the powers and faculties of his being, it should be his enlisting on
   the side of King Jesus! My Master calls you to serve Him, not with a
   timid, vacillating, fitful service, but He demands that you be bold and
   brave, valiant and venturesome in His service. He provides you with
   strength--He may well require your diligence! 'Tis

   meet that you serve Him with all your powers of body, soul and spirit.
   The love we bear to Christ should not be a mere complacency, bland and
   gentle, a matter for well-bred reticence, rather than for blind avowal.
   No, let it be a mighty, all-constraining potion that gets hold of a man
   like a whirlwind, and carries him along! Ah, I think this love of Jesus
   should be dearer to the heart than light to the eyes! It should throb
   with every pulse of life! It should warm one's blood as it circulates
   through the veins. It should inflame the heart with zeal and mold the
   constitution of one's soul! The cold, quiet man, or the passive,
   lukewarm man, are alike unfit to engage in our Master's service! Should
   not the love of disciples to their Lord be stronger than the love of
   the husband to his wife, of the mother to her child, or of friend to
   friend--a love compared with which there is no love on earth to be
   found--a love that is strong as death? Connected with this love and as
   a result of it, jealousy is brought under our notice.

   "Jealousy is cruel as the grave." Whenever love absorbs the heart,
   jealousy will guard the object of affection. Only let a provocation
   occur, something of jealousy is sure to appear! Your love to Christ
   especially lacks the genuine stamp if it is never awakened to jealousy
   by the malice of foes and the faithlessness of professed friends of our
   Lord. Many Christians, nowadays, have a kind of love which is too fond
   of ease and too full of compromise to kindle any jealousy in their
   breasts. The saints of olden times--how sensitive they were! How
   quickly their hot indignation was kindled! When Baal, the abomination
   of Moab, was worshipped in Israel, Moses said to the judges, "Slay,
   everyone, his men who were joined unto Baal Peor." So, too, at the time
   that the golden calf was made in the wilderness, you will remember that
   Moses' anger waxed hot and he stood at the gate of the camp and said,
   "Who is on the Lord's side, let him come unto me," and all the sons of
   Levi gathered themselves unto him. At his bidding, by the word of the
   Lord, they took, every man, his sword, and went in and out from gate to
   gate to slay every man--his brother, his companion and his neighbor!
   There fell of the people that day about 3,000 men! Their love to
   Jehovah gave them a jealousy which was cruel as the grave in avenging
   idolatry! You remember how it was accounted to Phineas, the son of
   Eleazar, for righteousness, that he rose against Zimri, a prince among
   the Simeonites, and thrust him through with a javelin when he was
   caught in sin with a Midianite woman. Such jealousy was cruel as the
   grave! Men like Elijah did not say, in gentle accents, "Comprehensive
   charity is better than Covenant Truth. Give us full liberty to worship
   Jehovah and you shall have perfect liberty to worship Baal." No! He
   contested the question with the idolatrous priests. The verdict came by
   fire from Heaven! The frightened multitude saw it and cried out,
   "Jehovah, He is the God." Then said Elijah, "Take the prophets of
   Baal--let not one of them escape." This was the voice of a man who
   loved the Lord! Who was jealous for His name--and these excited in him
   a holy anger and a righteous enmity against the worshippers of idols!

   Now, under the Christian dispensation, we can have no such anger
   against individuals! Our Lord has taught us, by His example, that they
   are rather to be pitied than hated by us. But, on the other hand, in
   zeal for the Lord of Hosts and in hatred of every false way, a
   Christian walking in the light of the Gospel should excel the most
   devout Jew under the old dispensation! Persecution is unprincipled. It
   violates the law of love to which we owe a supreme allegiance. But true
   faith never can hold fellowship with infidelity! Vital godliness must
   be at hostility with all unrighteousness of men. Do we seem to speak
   bitterly? I suppose it never will be a very sweet thing to tell people
   of their faults. We should like to know whether Luther did not speak
   bitterly. What kind of honey did he use? Did Calvin declaim in soft and
   silvery tones? Did Hugh Latimer, when he encountered Popery, line his
   mouth with velvet and deliver himself in delicate phrases?

   What do you think, Brothers and Sisters? Did ever patriot stand upon
   maudlin civilities when he saw conspirators plotting against his
   country? Did any noble-minded philanthropist cringe with misgivings, or
   apologize for interfering with the miscreant libertines who defile the
   youth and beauty, or debauch the homes of the people? And can it be
   possible that any lover of God, and valiant defender of the faith ever
   did, or ever shall, buckle to those damnable heresies which are alike
   insulting to the Lord, who bought us, and destructive to the souls of
   men whose redemption is inestimably precious in His sight? No, but they
   only cared to clear themselves of the blood of souls against the Last
   Great Day. What I long to see in every Church is not a breach of
   charity between man and man, but the utter destruction of that pseudo
   charity which is now the curse of the Christian Church! If you have a
   partiality towards what Christ hates. If you have pity for Agag, whom
   God abhors. If you have a wish to tolerate that which exalts human
   pride, though it is utterly derogatory to your Master, truly, then, you
   are a traitor, however unintentionally to your Master! You do not show
   any wise and discriminating love to Him, for if your love were
   vehement, you would be jealous of His crown jewels and you would not
   suffer any other to be recognized as the Head of the Church but your
   Lord. If you love Him, you will be jealous of His

   Atonement, and you will not allow that anything else can cleanse from
   sin but that blood He shed for our remission. If you love Him, you will
   become jealous of His Spirit and you will not be willing that the new
   birth which comes of His operations should be set down to any mere
   ceremony! If you love Jesus Christ, you will be jealous of His Deity
   and you will not be party to bits of bread and drops of wine being
   adored as the body and blood of Christ--when you know that He is in the
   body up above, dwelling before the Eternal Throne of God! You will feel
   that error, instead of being stared at as an object of scientific
   interest, is a thing to be shuddered at as a malignant disease--and to
   be guarded against as an epidemic! With Jezebel, you can have no peace
   while she loves her vicious unions. You will contend against every
   faction which conspires to tarnish the Redeemer's Glory and cast Him
   down from His excellence.

   "Jealousy is cruel as the grave." "Hard" is the word. "Jealousy is
   hardas the grave." Truly the grave is hard. It has not the slightest
   compunction. It holds fast the prey that is taken by its master. As
   Christians we are, and we must be, lovers of mankind. Men we love--men
   we would at all times help and serve. No clime nor caste, no
   geographical line or national character can define the boundary of our
   heart's yearning for the welfare of humanity while we act on the
   commission to preach the Gospel to every creature. But error we must
   expose and cry out against--and rest not day nor night till the arm of
   God has torn it up, root and branch! This seems to me to be a natural
   consequence of loving Christ much. If you love Christ but little, you
   will hate error but little. If you do not love the Truth of God at all,
   you will not hate error at all. You will say, "Oh, what does it matter?
   It is a mere theologian's dispute--let it be left to the schools to
   wrangle over." Not so! When you once begin to think, "Such-and-such a
   Truth of God is precious to me as my life! It is identified with my
   being and my well-being"--from that very moment you will be filled with
   a jealousy which is hard as the grave! Turning now from our love and
   jealousy for our Savior, let us speak a little of--

   II. THE SAVIOR'S LOVE AND JEALOUSY TOWARDS US.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ, we know, has a love for us that passes all
   understanding and, however it may seem to grate upon the ear, it is
   equally true that He has a jealousy over His people which watches them
   with incessant care. I need not prove to you that the love of Jesus
   Christ for us is as strong as death--He verified that when He tasted
   death in all its bitterness--forsaken, not only by men, but, worst of
   all, forsaken by His God. "Eli, Eli, lama, Sabachthani" was the
   concentration of all griefs! Such was His cry upon the accursed tree.
   Death never made Him flinch. He faced and felt its extreme agonies, and
   loved us then, as He loved us before, and as He still loves us with
   Infinite tenacity! The fact that His love is strong as death admits of
   no question. But here is the point I am coming to--His jealousy is
   cruel, or hard as the grave. He is never cruel towards His people, but
   He is very hard on foe or rival that would come between His people and
   Himself--yes, hard as the grave!

   Consider this, my beloved Friends. You and I once cherished a
   self-righteousness that stood in the way of our receiving Christ. We
   would not look to Him, nor trust Him, but we loved our own works. We
   thought ourselves at least as good as others and we rested there. Now
   how relentless the Lord was in cutting down that self-righteousness of
   ours! He never gave it any quarter. How He denounced it, doomed it and
   utterly destroyed it! We thought so much of it that we would have
   harbored it, but He would not tolerate a bit of it. He turned our
   beauty into ashes and our glory into confusion of face--for He loathed
   our self-righteousness more than we ever loathed our uncleanness and
   impiety! He accounted it neither fit for the land nor yet for the
   dunghill. How He then dealt with us in severity! What cuts and wounds
   we had! We were killed, some of us, by His Law. We cried out of the
   depths to Him, but still He apparently had no pity and no mercy! We
   seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the mire, till, as we read the
   Book of Job, and the Lamentations of Jeremiah, we felt that the
   expressions we found there had been written on purpose for us! We tried
   to pray, but our prayers came back from the brazen sky reverberating in
   our ears in notes of despair! We went to the House of God, but we found
   no comfort there. We turned to the Bible, but not a promise cheered us,
   for the Lord Jesus was jealous of our self-righteousness and He would
   not give us a comfortable word, nor so much as one kind look till that
   self-righteousness was wholly gone! When that was turned out of us, oh,
   the love passages, the blessed Revelations of His Divine Grace that He
   then gave us! But He would not give us so much as a glance of kindness,
   or a sentence of cheer until first He had got rid of the unholy things
   that provoked His jealousy!

   Since then we have had many visits from Him, yet He has not ceased to
   be jealous. I have held interviews today with a goodly number of those
   who have lately found Christ, and I observed among them many who were
   brought to seek His face by the death of a husband, or a child and, in
   some cases it was not only the loss of one child, but of another and

   another. I have frequently met with instances where a woman has been
   bereaved both of her child and of her husband before she yielded up her
   heart to Jesus. He has had to be "cruel as the grave" before He got rid
   of the object of His jealousy! She was wrapped up in the affections of
   earth--she had given herself up wholly to earthly things and so one
   gourd must wither, and then another, till there was nothing earthly
   left to shelter her--and then the poor weeping eyes were turned to the
   Cross--and only then did consolation come. Christ's jealousy is thus
   "cruel," but oh, what a blessed cruelty it is! It is better to enter
   into life halt and maimed, and having only one hand, than having two
   eyes and all our friends and kinsfolk about us, to be cast into the
   fires of Hell! It is better that we should suffer from cruel
   Providences, here, than that we should be permitted to go wafting along
   streams of pleasure down to the gulf of everlasting ruin! Blessed
   cruelty that makes us love the Savior by revealing the Savior's
   inextinguishable love for us!

   And since the day of our conversion, how many times have you and I
   cherished tastes and habits which we preferred before Christ and the
   walk of faith with Him? It is so easy to let the creature come in and
   usurp the place of the Beloved--thus to live half for God and half for
   our friends! But that will not do, for God will have us all love and
   serve Him with all our heart, and soul, and strength. Our dearest
   friends, the partners of our every joy and sorrow, every hope and fear
   of our mortal lives, if they take away our hearts from Christ, will
   either prove a bane to us, or else they will be taken away from us! I
   recollect the story of a Christian woman who had made a great idol of
   her child. He was her only son, and she lost him. Nothing then could
   console her, till at length one day she went into a Quakers' meeting.
   She sat there a long time, and not a word was spoken. Presently one of
   the members rose up and simply said, "Verily I perceive your children
   are idols." Not another word was uttered during the whole of the
   meeting. That word, however, was sent, by the Providence of God, and
   fastened like a nail in a right place! It had done its work--the
   mother's heart was comforted. She saw the reason of her loss and
   submitted her soul to the discipline. Now it is not only for children
   which we make idols. There are 20 other things. Twenty, did I say? Why,
   the world swarms with idols! Man is such an idolater that if he cannot
   idolize anything else, he will idolize himself and set himself up, and
   bow down and worship himself! But the Lord Jesus will never tolerate
   idolatry in any heart which belongs to Him! If He did not love you, you
   might do as you liked--but if He loves you, and has chosen you--and
   your heart then goes after idols--He will chasten you, vindicating His
   affection as well as His authority by the rod! What would it matter to
   me what your children did, in comparison with the responsibility I feel
   for my own? Whatever mischief they might do in the street, I might not
   feel called upon to interfere. You and I, alike, feel that we are each
   accountable to punish our own children when they are disobedient. And
   so is it with God. If you were not His children, you might live as you
   like and enjoy a measure of immunity for a while. But if you are His
   people, you are not your own masters and you will have a cross, if not
   a curse, come into your house! The spell of the idol will spoil your
   blessing. "Jealousy is cruel as the grave."

   Yet, let me say it again, this is blessed cruelty. We are very apt to
   think that a surgeon must have a hard heart and a cruel nature when we
   take a shallow view of the operations he performs and the nerve with
   which he performs them. A better judgment might convince you that the
   surgeon's knife is dictated by necessity, wielded with skill, careful
   to spare pain and designed to restore health. "Oh," you say, "only
   amputation will save his life--my child's leg must be taken off! It
   festers. It mortifies. I could not touch it. I could not do it--it
   cannot be done!" And when you hear that the surgeon has cut through the
   flesh and the bone, you are apt to think, "What a cold heart he must
   have! Ah, but which is the more profitable--that love of yours that
   would let the child die rather than do violence to its feeling, or that
   which would cut off its leg, in spite of all entreaties--to save its
   life? Oh, thank God for the surgeon! His deep incisions are tender
   mercies! His misgiving would be our undoing! And has not our God thus
   to deal with us when He takes those things from us which tend to be
   fatal issues and might otherwise prove our destruction?

   A fable has been sometimes told of a little plant which grew under a
   big tree and was thereby shielded from the storm--and kept tranquil and
   happy. The little plant prayed that it might grow into a tree, and its
   prayer was heard. The woodman came along and cut down the tree. Then
   the poor plant was exposed to the rain and the wind, and the snow and
   the frost--and it said, "Alas, for me, I am left in a pitiful
   condition!" But the angel of the tree told it that was the only way by
   which it could ever grow into a tree. So, dear Friends, when you lost
   your property, when the bank went bankrupt, when you lost your friend,
   when your mother died, when you lost, perhaps, your reputation through
   a slander which was abroad--it was only the taking down of the tree
   that the plant might grow--which could not have grown otherwise! You
   may think the discipline of Nature is harsh and cruel. Ah, well, the
   Lord lets you think as you like, and

   misjudge Him if you please, for He knows that time will soon correct
   your judgment! And then you will think very differently as you see the
   end from the beginning. You will judge more wisely when your faith is
   brought into active exercise. You yourself will then begin to abhor
   idolatry as Christ does, and you will marvel as much with thankfulness
   as though-tfulness that it is taken away. I have been reminded by this
   of what Rutherford said to Lady Erskine when she had lost her husband.
   "Well, your Ladyship," he said, "the Lord Jesus Christ sets great store
   by your love, for it is clear that He will have it all. He has taken
   away those who might have had a part of it and He has said, 'I will
   have it all! I have bought it, and I will have it.'" Perhaps the Master
   has been doing the same, or will do the same with some of us, so that
   He may get all our hearts to Himself.

   Now for our practical conclusion. Let our jealousy towards Christ now
   be cruel as the grave. Is there anything which keeps our heart from
   perfectly loving Christ? Let us have done with it at once! Have you got
   into any habit which keeps you from living near to Jesus? Is there any
   favorite sin which mars your communion with Him? Have you any little
   practice which, in itself, may be excusable, but which, in its
   tendency, may be injurious? Give it all up! He who is poor for Christ's
   sake is richer than the richest of men! And he who gives up a pleasure
   for the sake of Christ has more enjoyment in so doing than he would
   ever have had in the pleasure itself! It may be that you have been for
   some time trifling with a conviction which you would have embraced as a
   Truth of God, only it would have involved a sacrifice--and, therefore,
   you have halted and wittingly overlooked it. I know there are very many
   Christians just now who are in a position which they cannot justify,
   but they say they cannot see their way out of it. They apologize for
   themselves with questions like these--"How am I to get right? What
   shall I do?" Now, dear Friends, ask yourselves, Does not the Lord Jesus
   Christ deserve to have from you simple, absolute, unhesitating
   obedience? "Yes," you say. Then yield it to Him and ask for Grace, that
   from this day forth you may look with holy jealousy upon the most
   pleasant things that in any form or disguise come between you and your
   Lord and Master! Oh, what a happy life! What a blessed life you would
   lead! Yours will be a path of separation! You may have to journey over
   a rough road, nevertheless, let your love be strong as death and your
   jealousy cruel as the grave--and you will enjoy a communion with Christ
   dearer than life, and a Sabbath of peace that is like the days of
   Heaven upon earth!

   Well, my dear Hearers, there are some of you who have no part nor lot
   in the inheritance that we esteem beyond all other possessions. May God
   give you a share in it! Oh, if you have no love to Christ in this life,
   what can there be for you in the next but a fearful looking for
   ofjudgment and fiery indignation?! But trust in Jesus, trust in Jesus
   and you shall be saved! Being saved, you shall love Him and, loving
   Him, you shall be jealous of everything that comes in the way to divide
   you from Him. You shall be with Him at last in the land where doubts
   and fears can never enter, and where jealousy can no longer intrude.
   Thus you shall be forever with the Lord! Amen.

Sympathy and Song

   (No. 3517)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY JUNE 22, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   JANUARY 7, 1872.

   "Rejoice with them who rejoice." Romans 12:15.

   SYMPATHY is a duty of manhood. We are all brethren sprung from the same
   stock and that which is a good to any man ought to be a joy to me. That
   any man should be sick or sorry should, in a measure, make me sad, but
   that any man should rejoice with a worthy joy--worthy of a creature
   made by God--should make other men thankful! But what is thus a natural
   duty is elevated into a yet higher duty and a more sacred privilege
   among the regenerate among the family of God, for over and above the
   ties of manhood in the first Adam, there are the ties of our new
   manhood in the Second Adam--and there are bonds which arise out of our
   being quickened by the same life! We have "one Lord, one faith, one
   baptism." We are members of one body, having only one Head--and one
   life throbs through all the members of that body. Hence, for us to
   strive with one another in joy and in sorrow would be to act contrary
   to the sacred instincts which arise out of Christian unity! If, indeed,
   we are one with Christ, we are also one with each other, and we must
   participate in the common joys and common sorrows of all the elect
   family. This, again, gathers yet higher force when the joys in question
   shall be spiritual joys. I am bound as a Christian to be thankful when
   my Brother prospers in business, but I may not be quite sure that that
   will be a real blessing to him. But if I know that his sou/prospers,
   then I may safely rejoice to the very fullest, for that must be a
   blessing to him and will bring honor to God! If I hear that any
   community prospers, I am bound to be glad of it, yet I cannot be sure,
   if the prosperity deals with wealth, that it is, on the whole, the best
   thing in the world. But when I hear that a Church is growing, that its
   zeal abounds, that the Spirit of God is at work in it, that God is
   glorified there, then I am bound to rejoice, for this is a joy which no
   man takes away--a joy about which there can be no question--a joy which
   brings glory to God and, therefore, must bring happiness to all those
   who find happiness in God's Glory!

   Now I desire at this time to talk to you, beloved Friends at home,
   about a joy which God has recently given to us. If all those shall be
   present tonight who are to receive the right hand of fellowship, they
   will make up no less than 118 that God has added to our number! Some of
   them are friends who have joined us from other Churches. Some few are
   those who have long known the Savior--but the great majority are those
   who have lately been brought out of the world-- lately been made to
   taste the new life! They have, we trust, washed their robes in the
   blood of Christ and are come here to say, "We belong to the people of
   God." Now if this was not a joy to us, it ought to be! And my objective
   tonight is to make you merry--to make Believers' hearts merry with
   it--merry after the good old Gospel sort of which we read just now.
   "They began to be merry," because the lost ones were found, the
   wanderers were restored. May God grant that a feeling of holy joy may
   go through the midst of this room! And if there are any in sorrow who
   cannot rejoice in their own joy, yet at least may their hearts be large
   enough to joy in other people's joy! And if tonight they would be bowed
   down if they only looked within, may they rejoice in the prosperity of
   Zion and be glad in the glory which is brought to God! Keeping entirely
   to this one point, we shall begin by saying, "Rejoice with them who
   rejoice"--that is, rejoice with those who are the converts--who have
   themselves been brought to Jesus! If there are any persons in the world
   who must of necessity be happy, they are those who have newly found
   "peace through believing." They may forget some of that happiness,
   by-and-by--all that arises from novelty will certainly depart--but now
   the love of their espousals is upon them, their heart rejoices in a
   new-found Savior! All their spirits are alive towards Him, their faith
   is in active exercise, their love is plain and, therefore, they are
   happy men and women! Find me those who have discovered Christ today,
   and I

   am certain I shall not find eyes full of tears, unless they are tears
   of joy! In looking back, I cannot remember any day in my whole life
   that was at all comparable to the day in which I looked to Him and was
   lightened. There have been joys since then--joys of all sorts have
   fallen to our lot, in a measure, but ah, that one day is still the
   great bright star in the skies, the red-letter day of all, the
   spiritual birthday, the day in which the soul came out of bondage and
   entered into its liberty! All those today, then, who are new converts
   and have come to cast in their lot among us--rejoice! And, my Brothers
   and Sisters, rejoice with them! You can enter into their joy, for you
   have tasted the same! Let the old memories be awakened, and the old
   love, and the old ardor. As you see them, think of the time when Jesus
   called you, and when you answered to His voice, sweetly compelled by
   His Divine Spirit. Let us now ponder together-- I. THE REASONS FOR OUR
   SYMPATHIZING JOY.

   In the case of some who will be added to us tonight, their joy is the
   greater, and ours with them, because their convictions of sin were
   painful It was my lot in some cases to see them when the hand of the
   Lord was heavy upon them-- when their sin haunted them day and night
   and they found no rest. And I thank God I had the privilege in some
   cases of speaking the word that God had ordained should turn their
   darkness into day--and I saw the change, the strange and marvelous
   change--which indicated itself upon their countenances when they said,
   "We understand it now. We trust the Savior, and our hearts are glad."
   Oh, you that ever felt the shackles and fetters of sin and Satan, do
   you remember how you leaped when they fell to the ground? Oh,
   participate, then, in the joy of those who have gained deliverance from
   their cruel sin and from the bondage of their many fears!

   In some cases, too, some of those converted to God have, since their
   conversion, been partakers of very remarkable peace. I now have in my
   memory the stories of one or two of them of the exceeding joy they have
   felt. They have not lost it, I trust, but it was, indeed, a peace of
   God which passed all understanding which filled their hearts and minds!
   Now you who have drunk of that sweet cup may sip this honey dropping
   from the comb! You cannot but rejoice when you think that they should
   be so full of joy! There were some aged ones, and they thanked God that
   in the sere and yellow leaf they found Him--that though 50 and even 60
   years had been spent in the service of sin and Satan, yet they were
   delivered from going down into the Pit! Rejoice with them! Some were
   young, very, very young--and I may say of some children to whom I
   spoke, their conversion and their testimony was as clear--indeed, it
   was more clearthan the testimony of many who were in middle life! And
   what a blessing when the young heart is wedded to the Savior, when the
   dawn of the morning has the dew of Grace upon it--when the soul comes
   into the bosom of the Savior while yet it is a lamb! Oh, bless God for
   the young and for the old, that they have come to Jesus and are resting
   in Him!

   Think, dear Friends, in the case of some whom God has converted
   here--and I may say in the case of some who will be added to us
   tonight--we joy when we remember what they were. I will not enlarge,
   but some here present could tell their own story of what Grace has
   done. Sitting here tonight, but a few months ago the ale-bench would
   have suited them far better! Singing songs of Zion, now, but unchaste
   music once would have suited their lips far better! But they are
   washed! They are pardoned, sanctified and changed! And as they rejoice
   in the change they feel, we cannot but rejoice with them!

   And then think of what they would have still been if Grace had not
   interposed, yes, and of what every one of us would have been today, and
   will be, unless the Grace of God shall keep its hold upon us, as, glory
   be to God, we believe it will, for every soul that is saved by Grace,
   if it had not been for that salvation, would have been cast away
   forever from the Presence of God--another firebrand in the everlasting
   flame--another soul that would have gnawed its fire-tormented tongue in
   vain, and asked for a drop of water--but to receive no answer of mercy!
   O Sirs, if you do not praise God for souls snatched from the jaws of
   Hell and, by Divine Grace, taught to walk in the way of Heaven, what
   will you praise Him for? If Heaven itself is glad, you who hope to go
   to Heaven, will you not participate in the joy? Otherwise, indeed, you
   seem to be unfit for that hallowed place and not to have the capacity
   which is necessary to enter into the joy of your Lord. They are glad. I
   would like you to have heard some of them at the Church Meeting
   here--how they gladly told of what the Lord had done for them! If there
   were but one, I would be glad. When God gives us scores we will be
   glad, and glad, and yet glad again! I went home very weary one day with
   seeing so many. The second day there were still more and I was more
   weary! I would like to die with such weariness, for it is such blessed
   work--this work of bringing in souls that are of the Lord's planting,
   and of the Lord's ripening, to the garner of His Church. Rejoice, then!
   Rejoice again! Rejoice with the converts!

   I hear here and there a faint voice saying, "Ah, I wish I could! I am
   glad they are converted, but I wish I were." Oh, Soul, I am glad to
   hear you say that, for when a heart longs for Christ, it will soon have
   Him! If you desire Him, He is free to you! Oh, when you say, "I would I
   were His. I would bow my neck to His gentle yoke. Oh, that He would
   forgive me and have mercy on me"--come and welcome! Come and welcome!
   You have but to trust and the work is done! You are saved! God grant
   that you may do it tonight!

   But now advancing a step tonight, dear Friends, we ought to rejoice
   with the friends of the converts, for when souls are saved they do not
   have the joy all to themselves. There are others concerned in it. There
   are parents and, in some cases, they have brought up their children
   with much anxiety and godly fear--and they have trembled lest the son
   and daughter of their love should depart with an evil heart of unbelief
   from the living God! And there are cases here in which parents have
   seen all their children coming forward and saying, "We are on the
   Lord's side." I do not think any joy-- there may be a greater joy, but
   I do not think any is sweeter than the joy of parents who see their
   children walking in the Truth of God! O you who have the same
   anxieties, enter into the joy of those whose anxieties are turned to
   confidence! In some cases it was not the parent, alone, but other
   friends--brothers and sisters--in some cases a husband--in more cases,
   still, a godly wife--in some a Christian nurse. Such have had anxieties
   and turned them into prayers and the prayers grew into an agony of
   soul--and they have seen the persons that they prayed for saved! They
   have heard those who once denied the Savior, confess Him. They have
   seen the proud sinew broken and the stout heart bowed down in
   repentance, and they are glad, very glad, tonight. Oh, let us
   sympathize with them, then, and enter into their joy! I think I hear
   one say, "So I would, but ah, it seems to send a pang into my soul to
   think I have not been saved." Well, I will not forbid the pang--it is
   natural, it is gracious--but at the same time will you not be glad that
   another has that which you do so covet? Be not envious! You may be--it
   is natural you should--but prevent the envy by entering in holy
   sympathy into the joy. It may be that if you can rejoice with their
   parents and with all other friends, when you have so done, you will be
   driven with greater anxiety to the Savior and, in answer to a more
   earnest prayer, the benediction will come to your household, too! Oh,
   they are glad houses in London where husband and wife walk together in
   the faith! They are not always the rich. They are not always the
   healthy. But they are always the happy who unite themselves in the
   bands of the Covenant of Grace with each other to the Lord, and walk
   hand in hand so! We will rejoice tonight with those who rejoice!

   I can only stay a minute where there is plenty of room to enlarge, and
   notice, in the next place, that we ought to rejoice with those who were
   the means of bringing those who are added to us t o a knowledge of the
   Savior. I would not arrogate any honor to myself whatever. Still, I
   have a joy, a joy which no man takes from me, that there have been
   many, many, many souls who have been brought to see the Savior and put
   their trust in Him by a simple testimony of the Word. Sometimes I know,
   indeed, that I could reckon up more than ten thousand souls that
   profess to have found the Savior through the hearing of the Word of
   God. And the world may say what it will, men may condemn as they will,
   but while God will seal the Word, we will bate no jot nor tittle of it,
   but still preach as we have received commission from the Lord of Hosts.
   But I am very thankful to have to add that in the cases of all the
   conversions that are worked here, there is a very large number that are
   brought to Christ not through the ministry from the platform, but
   through the ministry of many of my dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ
   who are here working for the Master with heart and soul! How rich has
   God made us--ah, some of our dear Brothers and Sisters especially--in
   the leading of young minds to the Savior. You will thank God for it who
   have brought hundreds to Christ! The Sabbath school has not been
   without a blessing. And in your tract distributing we have had cases of
   conversions! And from obscure and unknown individuals, occupying these
   pews tonight--from them there has been fruit! There are quiet, gracious
   women here who have brought in one or two to Jesus by their pious
   conversation. I am pleased when I hear such a story as this--"We never
   went to the House of God, Sir, but such-and-such a member of your
   Church became a servant-girl with us, and she was a quiet spirit and
   seemed so happy that we asked where she went--and we came, too--and we
   have come to join the Church of which she is a member, because of
   that." That has happened again and again!

   Yet, alas, there are other members of the Church whose conduct would
   not be the means of the conversion of anybody, but the very reverse!
   Yet I thank God for not a few whose lives and whose testimonies have,
   to my knowledge, brought many to the Savior. None know your names,
   Beloved! None can sound the trumpet before you, but you have been
   faithful servants in a few things! You will, in your turn, be made
   rulers over many things and you shall enter into

   the joy of your Lord! Oh, believe me, my heart is full when I think of
   sinners saved by simply telling the story of the Cross! This is a joy
   that the miser does not know of when he gloats over his treasure--a joy
   which the warrior knows not of, even when he rides in triumph through
   the streets--a joy which earth could not produce--from all her mines
   and all her fountains--the joy of bringing souls to Jesus Christ, their
   Savior! Rejoice, then, tonight with them that do rejoice." "Oh," says
   one, "I would, but I never was the means of the conversion of a soul."
   Do you remember our Brother's prayer last night, that every member of
   this Church might, during the year, be the means of the salvation of
   one soul? As he said, it was not a very large prayer--but if it were
   answered, there would be 4,500 more souls called by your
   instrumentality in that way! I know I said, "Amen," to it, and I do
   say, "Amen," to it! And I do pray that there may not be one barren one
   among you, but that the Lord may grant Grace to everyone to bring at
   least one to the Savior in 12 months! God grant it, for His name's
   sake! Well, if that is so, then you will be among those who will
   rejoice--and now you may rejoice in the anticipation of it! I am sure
   if you have not been useful, yourself, you cannot but be thankful to
   God that others have been--and you will rejoice with them that do
   rejoice!

   Again, we must pass on, but this time our joy must take a higher
   range--our thought must take a higher sweep! We have spoken of those
   who are converted, and of their kinsfolk and acquaintances, and of
   those who were the instruments of their conversion--but there are
   others who are rejoicing besides those on earth. The angels rejoice.
   Did we not read just now, "There is joy in the presence of the angels
   of God over one sinner who repents"? Angels have more to do with us
   than we know of. They are next akin to us, and they have a holy
   sympathy with us. They watch us when we go astray and when they
   perceive us hearing the Word, I do not doubt they hover over us to
   observe, as best as they can, how far the Word operates upon our mind!
   We read in Scripture--and that is the reason why the woman's head is
   covered, that she is to have a covering over her head because of the
   angels--but some read it because they observe the decorum and propriety
   of the assembly and even if we do not, they do. Angels, then, we
   believe, are in the midst of the congregations of the faithful, and
   when they see a sinner hearing the Word, I doubt not they watch with
   such anxiety as may be possible to spirits that cannot be unhappy! And
   when they follow home the Hearer, and they mark the expression, and
   they note the beginning of the prayer, I should not wonder but they
   whisper it as news in all the golden streets, "Behold, he prays!" And
   when they see the tear of repentance, that first ensign of the Grace of
   God, which, like the snowflake that comes in spring to be the prophet
   of the cooling summer--when they see this tear of penitence which
   foretells this change of heart and is the token of its having
   come--then they speed their way and tell their fellows up yonder and
   they strike their harps anew! There is joy in the presence of the
   angels of God over one sinner that repents--

   "And shall not we take up the strain?" They who are not of our race
   rejoice when any of our race are saved--and shall we be so
   flinty-hearted as not to be glad? No! You spirits, though we see you
   not, we hear--and what is done above is done here below! Your joy is
   participated in tonight.

   But now we must go much farther. "Rejoice with them that do rejoice."
   There is one (His name be ever blessed!)-- the Eternal Father (who is
   so represented by His own dear Son) is rejoicingand, therefore, though
   it is speaking after the manner of men, it is also speaking after the
   manner of the Man, Christ Jesus, and we cannot err! We find that the
   father, when the prodigal returned, was the chief in all the joy. He
   called others to rejoice with him, but it was thus, "Rejoice with me,
   for this, my son, which was dead, is alive again; he was lost, but he
   is found." In all the festival of that glad day there was joy with the
   neighbors and joy in the poor penitent son! But the greatest joy of all
   was in the glowing heart of the father who had loved his son, when his
   son loved him not--had seen his son when his son was afar off, and had
   run to meet his son when he was returning. Have you ever thought, and
   will you think, tonight, of the joy of God over recovered sinners? The
   joy of God! He is ever blessed! Infinitely blessed, but still He
   condescends to allow us to describe Him as being in this respect of
   like passions with ourselves--a Father rejoicing over a returning son!
   Beloved, enter into Jehovah's joy! Is God joyous--joyous over sinners
   saved? Let the sacred flame come on your soul. Have sympathy with your
   Father. Play not the part, the unworthy part, of the elder bother. As
   you yourselves were prodigals, and could not say, "These many years do
   I serve You," rejoice with your Father, who, in pressing others to His
   bosom, is only doing in their case what He has done to you--

   "With joy the Father does approve The fruit of His eternal love."

   He always loved the soul that He saves--loved it before it was created,
   loved it in the purpose of predestination, loved it when it fell, loved
   it when He ordained it to eternal life and gave it to His Son--loved it
   when it hated Him. Is it not written, "His great love with which He
   loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses and sins"? And that
   great love makes Him infinitely rejoice when He sees it recovered from
   its misery and danger and brought into a state of reconciliation and
   love to Himself. Share you, then, the Father's joy!

   But now forget not the joy of Another, never to be forgotten by us who
   are named by His name--the joy of the Shepherd who has found His sheep,
   that Great Shepherd of the sheep who laid down His life that He might
   save souls! Jesus is infinitely gladwhen a sinner repents! Measure, if
   you can, His joy. I have given you a task which you can never fulfill.
   I will give you two plumb lines, but they, like the deep you would
   measure, are themselves immeasurable! These two plumb lines are, first,
   the pangs He suffered for those souls and secondly, the love He bore
   and bears those souls. His joy in their salvation is proportionate,
   first, to the pangs He bore. So much the price, so much the value that
   He puts upon the purchase. By so much as the travail was bitter, by
   just so much the fruits of--that travail are sweet to Him. "He shall
   see of the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied"--only satisfied
   because He had the travail to obtain it, and He has obtained it. Had
   not the grief been deep, been Infinite, the joy had not been great
   enough to satisfy--to fill to the brim His soul with joy! I know Jesus
   was very sad when on earth, but yet I have sometimes thought that of
   all the men that ever lived, Jesus was the happiest Man, even in His
   sorrows, for it is not possible for a heart to be so full of love to
   others--to be so benevolent--and not to be happy! To love makes even
   suffering, in a certain sense, sweets for the object of loves. "The joy
   that was set before Him" made our Savior "endure the Cross," but not
   with a common endurance. He so endured it that He "despised the shame"
   and though it was shame, and it broke His health, yet it was shame on
   which, in the majesty of His love, He trampled with a sacred joy. Now
   today--

   "All HHis work and warfare done,

   He into HHis Heaven is gone!

   Now before His Father's Throne,

   There is pleading for HHis own." And as His own come to Him, one by
   one, and as they come sometimes in larger companies, the Savior does
   rejoice! Measure, I say, His joy by His pangs.

   Measure it by His love, too, His great love, His boundless love, love
   which many waters could not quench and which the flood could not drown.
   Now I say to every godly heart, Can you refuse to be glad when Jesus is
   glad? If He rejoices over saved souls, will you not rejoice with Him?
   Is there not a sacred infection in that heavenly heart? Do you not
   catch light from those beaming eyes? If you see Him glad, you forget
   your little sorrows. You think them great, yet you forget them. I pray
   God you may know the meaning of that verse here, "Enter you into the
   joy of your Lord." May you have His joy, Beloved, in you, so that your
   joy may be full, and so that you may rejoice with Christ who does
   rejoice. One other word--there is One other who rejoices--

   "The Spirit takes delight to view

   The holy soul He fires anew."

   Do we ever honor the Holy Spirit as we should? I fear we greatly grieve
   Him by our forgetfulness of Him. Think you a moment, Beloved. The
   Incarnation of Christ among the sons of men was a very, very great
   marvel of condescension! But I do not know whether the indwelling of
   the Holy Spirit in men is not, if possible, even a greater mystery of
   condescending love! Christ took on Him, flesh, but it was pure. No sin
   lives in His body. But the Holy Spirit dwells in sinful men. These
   bodies are His temples, but they are impure--and the Holy Spirit
   dwelling in us is constantly made to see the depravity of our hearts!
   Now Jesus Christ walked among the sons of men and saw sin, it is true,
   and His holy soul was grieved, but in a certain sense He was separate
   from sinners. But here is the Holy Spirit, Infinitely pure, tender,
   jealous for holiness, and yet He comes to dwell in our spirits! In our
   spirits He dwells and, perhaps, by the week together we do not even
   recognize His presence! And every day we rebel against His government.
   He sees us unholy and He is grieved at it, for our sakes and for His
   holiness' sake. He works Divine Graces in us and then we permit Satan
   to come in and spoil those very Graces! He instructs us and then we
   forget it. He leads us and then we start aside--and all the while the
   dear faithful, gentle, dove-like Spirit does not leave us! He abides
   with us and in us continually! He hides Himself, sometimes, and
   withdraws His condescension, but God does not utterly take His Spirit
   from us.

   Now in the case of every soul converted there have been strivings of
   the Holy Spirit. There have been resistances of the Holy Spirit. There
   have been grievings of the Holy Spirit. There have been sins against
   the Holy Spirit of many sorts and in many forms, but at last He has
   brought to bear Omnipotent persuasions upon the heart! At last He has
   put in His hand through the hole of the door and the soul has opened to
   the touch! At last He sees Jesus installed in the heart-- Jesus, whom
   the Holy Spirit delights to honor, for it is His work and office to
   reveal Christ to the soul! And surely there is as much of joy in the
   Holy Spirit, Himself, as there is in the heart of Jesus, or in the
   heart of the Eternal Father when at last a soul is saved! The triune
   God is glad! He rests in His love! He rejoices over the converts with
   singing!

   Come, Brothers and Sisters, let us, too, rejoice! Forget your own
   troubles a while! Forget, I pray, everything that might hamper and
   hinder, and let us come to the Table with our Brothers and Sisters,
   many of them who come here for the first time tonight! Let us feel that
   the fatted calf is killed and that the dancing and the music are with
   us, and let each be merry, rejoicing with the joy of our Lord, and with
   the joy which He has given to His saved ones! Oh, what joy it would be
   if all this congregation were saved! May we meet in Heaven, Beloved,
   every one of us!

   Now suppose the preacher should receive a message tonight that every
   soul here would be saved except one, and suppose it were revealed to
   him who that one would be and he was expected, now, to point out that
   one! Oh, dreadful message! With what trembling would you all sit, each
   one afraid lest it should be yourself to be left unsaved. I have no
   such message, thank God! And yet, yet if I could hope that all here
   would be saved but one, I must confess my heart would be lighter than
   it is, for unless some of you repent, forsake your sins, and fly to
   Christ, the lost will not be one, but many! Dear Hearer, let it not be
   you! While Mercy, still with silken accents speaks and cries, "Return,
   return!" While Love with bleeding hands beckons and cries with the
   wounded side of Christ, "Oh, believe and come! Whoever believes on Him
   shall be saved, for he that believes and is baptized shall be saved. He
   that believes not shall be damned!" May God help you to trust in Christ
   and live! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS 12:1-16.

   Verse 1. I beseech you, therefore, brethren--Paul is a calm reasoner.
   He is a bold stater of Truth of God, but here he comes to pleading with
   us. I think that I see him lift the pen from the paper and look round
   upon us as with the accent of entreaty, and say, "I beseech you,
   therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, by God's great mercy to
   you, His many mercies, His continued mercies." What stronger plea could
   the Apostle have? "I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of

   God."

   1. By the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living
   sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
   Though he beseeches you to do it, he claims a right to it! It is but
   your reasonable service. Do we need to be entreated to be reasonable? I
   am afraid that we do, sometimes. And what are we to do? To present our
   bodies to God, not our souls, alone, to make real, practical work of
   it. Let this flesh and blood in which your body dwells be presented to
   God, not to be killed and to be a dead sacrifice, but to live and still
   to be a sacrifice, a living sacrifice unto God, holy and acceptable to
   Him! This is reasonable. God help us to carry it out.

   2. And be not conformed to this world. Do not live as men of the world
   do. Do not follow the customs, the fashions, the principles of the
   world. "Be not conformed to this world."

   2. But be you transformed--It is not enough to be nonconformists. Be
   transformed ones, altogether changed into another form!

   2. By the reviewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good
   and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. It is by holy living, by
   consecrated bodies, that we are to prove the will of God! We cannot
   know it. We cannot practically work it out except by a complete
   consecration unto God.

   3. For I say, through the Grace given unto me, to every man that is
   among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think;
   but to think soberly, according as God has dealt to every man the
   measure of faith Humility is sober thinking. Pride is drunken thinking.
   He who thinks more of himself than he should, is intoxicated with
   conceit-- but he that judges aright and is, therefore, humble--thinks
   soberly. God give us to be very sober in our thoughts of ourselves.

   4, 5. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not
   the same office, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and
   everyone members, one of another Hence the diversity. If the hand were
   made exactly like the foot, it would not be a tenth part as useful. And
   if the eye had only the same faculty as the ear, it would not be able
   to see, and the whole body would be a loser thereby. Do we begin to
   compare eyes, and ears, and feet, and hands and say, "This is the
   better faculty"? No. They are each one necessary! So do not compare
   yourselves among yourselves, for if you are in the body of Christ, you
   are, each one, necessary, and the peculiarity which you possess, and
   the peculiarity which your Brothers and Sisters possess have their
   place in the corporate body, and must be precious before God!

   6-8. Having then, gifts differing according to the Grace that is given
   to us whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of
   our faith Or ministry, let us use it in our ministering: or he that
   teaches, in teaching. Or he who exhorts in exhortation. Keep to your
   own work. Stand in your own niche. If you are only an exhorter, do not
   pretend to teach. If your work is ministry, and you cannot prophesy, do
   not attempt to do it. Every man in his own order!

   8, 9. He that gives, let him do it with simplicity; he that rules, with
   diligence; he that shows mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be without
   dissimulation. Do not pretend to a love that you have not. Do not lard
   your speech with, "dear" this, and "dear" that, when there is no love
   in your heart! And even if your heart is full of love, show it without
   spreading molasses over your talk, as some do. "Let love be without
   dissimulation."

   9. Abhor that which is evil Be a good hater. Abhor that which is evil

   9. Cleave to that which is good. Stick to it. Hold it fast. Do not go
   an inch beyond it.

   10. Be kindly affectionate, one to another, with brotherly love. Hear
   this, you members of the Church. Endeavor to carry it out by a kindly
   courtesy and a real sympathy one with another--"Be kindly affectionate
   one to another with brotherly love."

   10. In honor preferring one another Putting another before yourself,
   aspiring after the second place, rather than the first.

   11. Not slothful in business.A lazy man is no beauty anywhere. 11.
   Fervent in spirit.Burn. Let your very soul get hot!

   11, 12. Serving the Lord. Rejoicing in hope. When you have not anything
   else to rejoice in, rejoice in hope!

   12. Patient in tribulation.The word, "tribulation," signifies threshing
   as with a flail. Be patient when the flail falls heavily.

   12, 13. Continuing instant in prayer Distributing to the necessity of
   the saints. When you have told your own needs to God, then help the
   necessities of those who come to you.

   13, 14. Given to hospitality. Bless them who persecute you: bless, and
   curse not A Christian cursing is a very awkward spectacle. Even the
   Pope, when he takes to cursing, as at least the former one used to do
   very liberally, seems as if he could hardly be the vicar of God on
   earth! Our work is to bless the sons of men. "Bless and curse not."

   15. Rejoice with them who rejoice. Do not be a wet blanket on their
   joys. If they have good cause for rejoicing, join in it. Help them to
   sing their hymn of gratitude.

   15. And weep with them who weep. Sympathize with mourners. Take a share
   of their burden. I really believe that it is easier to weep with them
   who weep than it is to rejoice with them who rejoice--for this old
   flesh of ours begins to envy those who rejoice--whereas it does not so
   much object to sympathize with those that sorrow. Carry out both
   commands. "Rejoice with them who rejoice. Weep with them who weep."

   16. Be of the same mind, one toward another Agree together, you
   Christian people. Do not be always arguing and discussing. Be of the
   same mind, one towards another. In Church life, very much must depend
   upon our unity in mind as well as in heart. "One Lord, one faith, one
   Baptism"--these help to make a good foundation for Christian
   fellowship!

The Powerful Truth of God

   (No. 3518)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY JUNE 29, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 11, 1872.

   "Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together
   and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them, and
   found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. So mightily grew the Word of
   God and prevailed." Acts 19:19,20.

   IT should be very encouraging to us to hear of the triumphs of the
   Gospel in the olden times. It is not only a matter of interest as to
   history, but it is a matter of practical consolation for the present
   day, for the Gospel is just the same today as it was 1,800 years ago!
   If we preach the Gospel at all, it is the very same Gospel which Paul
   delivered. We may not have all of Paul's gifts, or all of Apollo's
   eloquence, but for all practical matters, the same preaching is with us
   that was with Paul--and we may, therefore, expect to see the same
   results! It may be imagined, however, that perhaps the population may
   have changed in character, but, believe me, it is not so. The Gospel of
   Jesus Christ was not intended for one century or two, but for all time.
   After all, men's hearts have not altered. The population of London is
   not at all unlike that of Ephesus. They may dress very differently and
   their language is not the same, and their customs may outwardly differ,
   but as in water, face answers to face, so the heart of man to man! One
   man's heart is like another man's, and the sinners of 1,800 years ago
   are very much like the sinners of today. If a man should come into
   London with the same Gospel with which Paul went into Ephesus, he has a
   Gospel adapted to London as assuredly as the Gospel was adapted to
   Ephesus. More than that, we have the same spirit resting upon the
   Gospel, now, as then! The power which rendered the Gospel saving in the
   olden times was not Paul's logic, or Apollo's eloquence--the saving
   power lay in the Holy Spirit accompanying the Divine Truth. Now the
   Spirit of God is not straitened. He is Divine. His arm is not shortened
   that He cannot save. He is just as able to make the Word of God the
   power of God unto salvation, today, as He was then! Yes, and I bless
   His name, He is doing it! He has been doing it lately in Madagascar, as
   an instance in far-off lands, and we have seen Him do it in our very
   midst. We have known and conversed with multitudes who have been turned
   from darkness to light, from the slavery of Satan into the liberty of
   Christ by the power of the Gospel which Paul preached, which we, also,
   preach! When Paul and his two or three companions came into Ephesus,
   they were not one whit different from two or three Christians going
   into any city in the world with the view of evangelizing it! Of course,
   they had the gift of miracles, but we have other appliances which they
   had not. We have books which we can scatter far and wide--and we have
   an amount of religious liberty in almost every place which they did not
   possess. I do not think they stood on any vantage ground beyond
   ourselves, or, if they did, we can reach that same vantage ground--and
   we may expect that the God of Paul will work in London and elsewhere as
   he worked at Ephesus--if we know how to be as obedient to His Divine
   will and as earnest in our service to Him, as was that mighty Apostle
   of the Gentiles!

   Our text suggests to me to speak to you upon three matters. The first
   is--it is said the Word of God grew, so we will begin by noticing that
   in Ephesus the Word of God was planted. It could not have grown if it
   had not been planted. Secondly the Word of God grew--we will watch it.
   And then there was the Word of God prevailing over sin, for it made men
   burn their foolish books of magic. To begin then--

   I. THE WORD OF GOD WAS PLANTED.

   It is interesting to notice how it was planted in Ephesus. I read to
   you all about it and you noticed that when Paul first came there, there
   were a few persons that received him gladly. I suppose the Apostle went
   down into the Jews' quarter, for in all these cities there was a Jews'
   quarter, and he began to enquire a little and look about him--and he
   soon

   found there were some followers of John the Baptist there--about
   twelve. So he began with them. They were prepared ground, well plowed,
   ready for the Seed--so he instructed them a little further in the faith
   and they believed in the Lord Jesus. And they were baptized and became
   the nucleus, the first 12 with which to form a Christian Church. Go,
   servant of Christ, go where God sends you! There are some prepared of
   God to receive you. In the most barren country there are some pieces of
   soil that, like oases, are abundantly fertile! In any company of the
   most depraved of men there are some hearts made willing by God who will
   receive the Gospel at once! We must never think if God sends us upon
   what looks like hard ground, that it is as hard as it looks! It is our
   unbelief that is hard. If we conquer that, we shall be surprised to
   find that God has cleared the way for us and, perhaps, where we looked
   to find no friend, there shall be a chosen 12 who will be glad to
   receive us! I speak to you who go about serving Christ--I beseech you
   to be of good courage, for your Lord has prepared some and made them
   ready for you! I feel tonight, when I preach the Gospel, that there are
   some who will hear it and say, "Ah, that suits me! I am guilty and I
   need a Savior." They have heard the Baptist preach of repentance, but
   they do not know yet what simple faith in Jesus is, and I am hoping
   that when they hear, tonight, that there is life in one look at the
   Crucified Savior, and that whoever trusts in Jesus will be saved, they
   will accept the good news with great gladness and will soon be numbered
   among the disciples of Jesus of Nazareth. God grant it may be so!

   But the Apostle found that there was a great deal of stony ground at
   Ephesus. The people did not all receive him, though 12 men did, and I
   suppose some women with them. Generally, I find more women receiving
   the Gospel than men, so I suppose he gathered at least 24 who had known
   John the Baptist and his preachers. But the rest of the people were not
   after this fashion. Well, Brothers and Sisters, why should they be? Is
   the servant of Christ to expect to find all men willing to receive him?
   They rejected Christ--shall they receive us? If the work which our
   Master sent us upon were all easy, where were the honor of it? He gives
   easy work to those who are weak, but if he endows us with His own
   power, of course He will give us difficulties to overcome! We must not,
   therefore, flinch because we are rejected by many, but just buckle on
   our harness and ask fresh strength from God and give ourselves to the
   work! Paul went down to the synagogue and the Jews allowed him to
   speak. After he had spoken, they began to dispute. He answered their
   questions. He persuaded them and it appears that a great number of
   them, after hearing his answers to their difficulties, and listening to
   his solemn persuasive appeals, were led to believe that Jesus was the
   Christ, and to trust in Him--and so were saved! Well, blessed be God,
   when we go to plant the Gospel anywhere we may expect to find some
   whose difficulties will speedily yield to further light, who, though at
   present they are prejudiced, will give up their prejudices when they
   understand more completely the Gospel. There may be--probably there
   are--some here, tonight, who do not quite know what the Gospel is,
   about which we say so much. And when they understand that it is just
   this, that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, became Man and suffered in the
   place of all who trust Him, in order that they might not suffer for
   their sins--when they understand that Truth of God, it may be they will
   say, "Well, that is just what I need--someone to stand in my place.
   Someone to be a Savior to me. I believe in the Son of God!" The
   preacher shall be right happy if he meets with such. Even though he
   should have to meet many of their objections and answer them, one by
   one, if at last they will be led to believe in Jesus by the power of
   His Spirit, happy shall the preacher be!

   But it appears that there was a third class among those to whom Paul
   ministered, who, after all that he could say, were hardened. He gave
   them clear proof that Jesus was the Christ and he urged them to repent
   of sin. He persuaded them to believe in Jesus, but they were hardened
   the more by it--and they proved their hardness by this--that they spoke
   evil concerning this Way. Mostly when men will not submit to Christ,
   they try to find some fault. Perhaps they will slander the preacher, or
   the people of God, or they will misrepresent the Gospel, or they will
   catch up certain phrases and words and twist them, misrepresent them.
   Common enough, we grieve to say, is this among graceless hearers. What
   they will not receive themselves, they rail at. They are like a dog in
   a manger--they cannot eat the hay, so they lie there and bark! They
   won't enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and those who would enter, they
   hinder them if they possibly can. Even when they see the power of the
   Gospel upon others, they will turn it to ridicule. They wonder at the
   change that is worked, but they are filled with wrath against it and
   will not submit to Christ. However, Brothers and Sisters, though there
   will always be such as these, we are not to be cast down about it, for
   if we are ever able to say, as Paul was, "I am clear from the blood of
   all men," it will be no small thing to be able to say it, even if great
   numbers should reject the teaching which we present to them. I have
   often prayed that I might be able to say what George Fox, the first
   Quaker, said when he came to die. He said, "I am clear, I am clear, I
   am clear of the blood of all men." Oh, if we can only get to that,
   though Israel is

   not gathered, yet shall Christ be glorious in His Father's eyes, and
   Christ's servants shall be accepted in Him, too! We must always reckon
   that after the most diligent ministry, some will believe the Gospel,
   and some will not believe it at all. However, the Apostle Paul, though
   he was beset by those who despised him and lay in wait for his life,
   did not hesitate to preach the Gospel to all men, for we are told that
   it was known to all in Asia, both Jews and Greeks! He went on
   scattering his Seed--whether it fell on stony ground or among the
   thistles and thorns--that was no business of his! It was his to scatter
   the seed--it was God's business to make it fall in the right place! He
   that sows is responsible for the sowing, not for the reaping! If he
   does what his Master bids him, it is his Master's work to take care of
   the precious Seed and make it spring up--not the servant's.

   I would exhort all here who love the Lord Jesus Christ to try to do
   what the Apostle did--try to break up fresh ground and get fresh
   hearers. The Gospel succeeded all the better in Ephesus because it was
   a new thing there. I believe I should have a better hope of
   conversions, tonight, if I were speaking to people who had never heard
   the Gospel before. For after long hearing the Gospel, men get
   accustomed to it--the most startling warnings do not alarm--and the
   most wooing invitations do not attract! I should not have such
   attention as you are kind enough to give me, but perhaps here and
   there, where attention was given, the barbed arrows of Divine Truth
   would stick fast in true hearts, whereas in some now present it is
   almost hopeless work to speak, for it is not to know the Gospel that is
   needed with them--it is to have a heart to yield to it, a soul to give
   it due attention and a reverent, believing reception! May God grant
   that you may yet be saved! But my hope lies in my Brothers and Sisters
   in Christ breaking up fresh ground. Open little rooms, dear Friends,
   wherever you can, in every part of London! I have a great belief in
   cottage meetings to get to the poor. We ought to have, if we are a
   truly living Church, we shall have--little preaching rooms in every
   court and alley! And if men can't come here, or won't come here--and
   really, I see not how they can, for I do not perceive that there is
   room for any more--we must go and take the Gospel to them! And if I
   must tarry here with the thousands, go, my Brothers, to the tens, and
   twenties, and the people of London shall hear the Gospel, somehow, and
   we shall each be able to say, "I am clear of the blood of all men." We
   need more of the work of the Apostle in breaking up fresh ground! God
   stir us up to it and send us success in it! Thus I have spoken of the
   planting. Now to our second point--

   II. THE WORD OF GOD GREW.

   A man drops an acorn into the ground, goes his way and forgets it. When
   he comes back 20 years later, he finds a very respectable tree! And if
   he could live to come bank in a century, he might find a tree that
   seemed to cover acres with its outspread branches--all from a single
   acorn! We never know what will come of an attempt to do good. Paul
   steps into Ephesus with a friend or two, and finds 12 that come at his
   call--but before he has left Ephesus, what a stir the man has made!
   There was never such a shake given to a city as Paul gave to it! By the
   Grace of God, the Gospel grew! Let us notice how it grew.

   First, there was a Church formedin Ephesus, which appears to have been
   a strong Church. You notice that the Elders of the church came to
   Miletus to Paul. There were many elders and I suppose the elders were
   in proportion to the people, so that there was a very large Church
   gathered there. This is delightful fruit, to find men made Believers--
   willing to be baptized on profession of their faith and then formed
   into Christian Churches. Paul had not labored in vain, for he had lit
   such a lamp in Ephesus as should not soon be put out! In addition,
   however, to the Church, a great many people in Ephesus had been
   impressed--perhaps not savingly, but they had been impressed, for they
   became the friends of Paul. At your leisure, will you read the rest of
   the Chapter? You will find that a great mob gathered in the theater on
   one occasion, excited to great wrath against Paul--and Paul, like the
   little hero that he was--wanted to go right into the great amphitheater
   to address them, but some of his friends said, "No, no! You mustn't do
   that! They'll tear you to pieces." Our brave little man felt that he
   would like to go and preach to them. He wanted to get a chance, if he
   could, of speaking the Word of God. There they were, all on stone
   seats, tier on tier--a great mass--much, I suppose, like the Coliseum
   at Rome, and he thought he must go in and talk to them! But it is said
   that "certain of the chief of Asia which were his friends" prevented
   his going in. The disciples would not, perhaps, have had influence with
   him, but these were men of rank and ability, who said, "We are not
   Christians, but we respect you, and we don't want to see you torn to
   pieces by that wild rabble. Don't go in"--and Paul did not go in. Now,
   where souls are saved, if the Gospel is truly preached, it will always
   have a great many friends, and these will, perhaps, serve a great turn
   at a pinch and in times of difficulty. And I am not sure but what these
   "chief of Asia" may, after all, some of them, have become Christians,
   for if a

   man does not want to be a Christian, it is a very dangerous thing to be
   friendly to Christ! When you come to mix up with God's people and help
   them, and befriend them, it often happens that the Lord, in return for
   a cup of cold water that is given to a Prophet in the name of the Lord,
   gives the promised reward--and he who was but a friend becomes, at
   last, kith and kin with us and joins us! I am thankful to know there
   are those in this place who love the Gospel in a way, and would stand
   up for it and defend it--and delight to hear it preached--and though
   they are not yet saved, the Gospel is growing, for it has some effect
   on them! And they shall have our earnest prayers that they may not be
   outside buttresses of the Church, but may be built into the walls of
   it!

   We love some of you because you are always ready to help and defend the
   faith after your way. Cast in your lot wholly with us, I pray you! Take
   for yourselves the precious privileges of the Gospel! May the Lord
   enable you! When we think of you, we feel like the Savior when He
   looked at the young man who had great possessions--it is said He loved
   him. But alas, the Savior also sorrowed for him when he went away! May
   we not have reason to sorrow for you who are so near to God, but lack
   the one thing necessary? May you find it and may you yet be brought in!
   That it grew, there was another proof, for even the vilest and most
   wicked people in Ephesus knew about Jesus Christ How do I know that?
   Why, there were certain tramping vagabonds who came into Ephesus trying
   to deceive the people, pretending to heal by magic, and they knew about
   the Gospel. How? I am sure they did, because they said, "This name of
   Jesus is a very great name, and seems to have great power! We will try
   and summon spirits by it." This was a villainous thing to do, yet it
   showed that the Gospel had got at them and reached them! I like to hear
   little children in the street singing delightful hymns about Jesus
   Christ, for it shows me that the Gospel has got at the very lowest
   strata of society--and those little children don't hold their tongues
   when they are at home, depend upon it! It is very hard to make them
   hold their tongues anywhere. They have made father hear about "Jesus,
   meek and mild," and I should not wonder if the consciences of some of
   the ungodly men of London were touched by the words of their little
   children! I heard Lord Shaftesbury say a very good thing the other day,
   and I agreed with him. He said that the little children of London were
   very weighty ones, and where a missionary could not go, the little
   children could and, clambering on their father's knee, could sing the
   Gospel! And thus in many a house where there is a man who scorns to go
   to a Church or Chapel to hear the Gospel, a little child, who has just
   given his father a kiss, is singing to him--

   "Just as I am, without one plea

   But that Your blood was shed for me,

   And that You bid me come to Thee,

   O Lamb of God, I come!"

   Lord, bless the little preacher, and save the father's soul! Who knows
   how many may be brought to Jesus so? It shows that the Gospel spreads
   when even the worst of men know something about Christ. Even though
   they use the Word to swear by, yet I am glad they know it. Though they
   put it to such a use as to try to be the devil's servants, with
   Christ's name on their lips, yet am I glad that the Kingdom of Heaven
   has come near unto them!

   One other proof that the Gospel had come to Ephesus was this, that it
   affected their trade. A thing is pretty powerful when it begins to
   affect the trade of a town. Now in Ephesus there was a goddess called
   Diana. I have seen the thing at Rome. It is ugly enough, certainly, for
   anybody to worship. It is a female figure with a countless number of
   breasts, intended to signify the bounties of nature which she supplies
   to multitudes of men and beasts. Ugly and ill-formed, it was,
   nevertheless, greatly worshipped at Ephesus. It was set in a niche in a
   temple and generally covered with a curtain. This was drawn aside for
   worshippers and on particular festival days people came to Ephesus from
   all parts of the world, and very seldom did one of them go home without
   taking with him a small image of Diana. Some of them were made of wood
   for the poorer sort, but many were made of metal--copper, brass, silver
   and gold. Well, when Paul was preaching there during the third year,
   there was a time when the great festivals were held. Ephesus was not
   anything like so full as it had been--it might have been almost as
   full, but there were not so many at the temple and, somehow, the shops
   hadn't sold the shrines so readily--had not sold anything like the
   usual quantity! And one great man had a factory and made many shrines,
   and he called his workpeople together and said, "Do you know, this year
   we have not sold as much as we did last year by 50 per cent? The fact
   is, you'll all be out of work. I can't keep you on full time. I can't
   sell the goods. Our trade is going to the dogs and it is all because of
   that fellow, Paul! He has been here three years, now, and he has turned
   the people to worship the Invisible God and they won't worship Diana."
   Well, these workpeople did not consider whether it was right or wrong,
   but it touched their pockets--and that is often a very powerful place
   in which to touch a man! They

   thought they might not have such good wages, by-and-by, so they rushed
   home and told other workmen that belonged to kindred trades. And then
   Demetrius came in and told them that Diana was being put aside by this
   Paul, who preached and turned away many people! And there was a great
   row and they rushed to the theater, but the Recorder of the city
   addressed them very wisely, and they dispersed. This showed the power
   of the Gospel--it began to affect trade.

   I wish the Gospel would affect the trade of London! I wish it might.
   There are some trades that need affecting, need to be cut a little
   shorter. Oh, that God would so influence men that they were not given
   to bestial drunkenness as they are! That the money, which ought to go
   to their wives and children, might no longer be squandered in evil
   spirits that make themevil spirits! Would God that the New Cut would
   become a place where men might walk on Sunday. But not by an Act of
   Parliament! Let Acts of Parliament leave us alone! We can fight that
   battle alone. May it come to an end by the spread of the Gospel! We do
   not wish to see any break the Gospel Sabbath--it is a day of rest and
   worship--and we love to have it so. I have no faith in any reformation
   that does not come through men's hearts being changed. You may make
   them hypocrites, but you cannot make them right except by the Gospel
   coming into their very souls and taking possession of them! Plant it
   everywhere all over London, north and south, east and west, in every
   court, and street, and lane and, by the Grace of God, yet shall souls
   be saved and Churches formed, the wicked instructed and even trade,
   itself, will have to take its shape! A better shape than it now
   has--under the molding hand of the Gospel of Jesus Christ!

   But now I must go on to another point, and that is this. While the Word
   of God thus spreads, we ought to consider how it was. This great spread
   of the Gospel was due to the work of the Holy Spirit Yes, that is quite
   correct! Let me say something else. This great spread of the Gospel was
   due to the work of the Apostle Paul. I know the Holy Spirit works, but
   when He works, He makes us work! Find me one instance in Scripture
   where the Holy Spirit ever moved a city like Ephesus by a lazy, idle
   minister that read other people's sermons on Sunday--and did not care
   about the conversion of souls! I would like to meet with something of
   that kind, but I know I never shall. Where God works, He works with men
   that work! Notice those churches where the preacher says, "It is the
   Holy Spirit's work to seek souls, and God will have His own elect."
   Very true Doctrine! But mark those places where there is nothing on a
   Sunday but four or five Doctrines ground out as on a barrel organ, and
   the preacher does not care whether the people are lost or saved. Notice
   the people who seem to be fatalists, asleep in the belief that things
   are to be--where there is no Sunday school, no street preaching, no
   doing anything, no seeing whether God brings multitudes of souls to Him
   and whether He makes the population in their district tremble before
   His power! They get to be a miserable few, and they get some little
   Rehoboth (which they call Rehoboth), that is to say, a room--and it is
   a very little room, indeed--and they gradually decay and die out! And
   so it must be. We cannot save a soul and are powerless apart from the
   Spirit of God, yet wherever the Spirit of God is, He fills men with
   energy! He makes them earnest and intensely earnest!

   I read to you about Paul. There was that dear good man working all the
   week, making tents in order that nobody might say he preached for what
   he could get. There he was making tents and he says yet every day he
   preached from house to house, and in the big schoolroom of one
   Tyrannus, and everywhere else night and day, and he wept over them, he
   says, "night and day with tears," and he prayed over them, and would
   not give them any rest unless they came to Christ! The man was always
   at it--he threw his whole soul into it--and a big soul it was, too! Oh,
   Beloved, if we are ever to see the Word blessed, and this great city
   saved, it will be by everyone of us being thoroughly awake in our
   Master's service! Oh, that the Lord would stir up all the ministers in
   London! I think that we have enough in number--if we had God's power
   resting upon all. Oh, for God's Jonah, who would, from end to end,
   proclaim a warning through the city! Oh, for one John the Baptist, who
   would preach, "Repent! for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand." What if I
   said, Oh, for one Martin Luther, whose thundering voice should make men
   hear? Oh, for one George Whitefield, who, with uplifted hands, would
   cry, "The life to come! The life to come!" and make masses gather to
   hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ! Pray for it, dear Friends. God won't
   save the world without men--He will use instruments until Christ comes!
   And while you pray for it, pray for yourselves, that each one of you
   may be in earnest, for, other things being equal, God will bless that
   people most who work most for Him, pray most to Him, give most to Him,
   sacrifice most and are most obedient to His commands. God make us such!

   Now the last point is this. The Gospel not only grew, but we are told
   in the text--

   III. THE WORD OF GOD PREVAILED OVER SIN.

   We have an instance given of how it prevailed, to which I call your
   particular attention. Paul, in his preaching, it appears, was not at
   all like some who think they are very faithful when they abuse people.
   I daresay Paul, in his preaching, made the remark that God was not like
   unto images of silver and gold of man's making--but Paul never abused
   Diana. How do I know that? He never did, for the Town Clerk in the
   theater said, "These men are not robbers of churches, neither are they
   blasphemers of your goddess." Paul had just uttered the general
   Doctrine that idolatry was a great sin--he had not poured out a great
   torrent of abuse on Diana and all the rest! In the course of his
   preaching I daresay he had remarked that magic and sorcery were
   abominations, but Ephesus was very much given to sorcery. There were
   certain things called Ephesian letters, supposed to possess great
   magical power, sold at Ephesus. There are many stories which every
   reader of classic history knows, such as that of a wrestler who always
   used to win the day because he wore round his neck one of these
   charms--all lying stories--but they were freely believed! Most of the
   Ephesians believed that the letters written round the base of Diana
   possessed potent charms. Now Paul, though he was not preaching about
   this, was preaching the Gospel--yet the Gospel found out this
   particular sin and hit the nail on the head--and God worked with the
   Gospel, for when the seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, tried to practice
   magic and used the name of Christ, the evil spirit leaped on them and
   overcame them and would have slain them--and they were held up to
   ridicule. Now there is one thing about the Gospel in every place--it
   finds out the particular sin of that place and it is quite sure to
   expose it. I have frequently, in this congregation, made remarks
   without knowing anything about the persons present, and they have come
   and asked me who told me about them. It has happened scores of times
   that the Word has so minutely described the case of a hearer that he
   has felt convinced that the preacher must have been instructed about
   his case and told what to say--though in truth the preacher knew
   nothing about it, only the preacher's Master made his tongue to speak
   the Word so as to fit the case!

   Now by Paul's preaching, and through the Providence of God, the people
   at Ephesus began to be convinced that the use of magic was a wicked and
   disgraceful thing--and many of them came forward and confessed that
   they had been guilty of it. They confessed it to the preacher. They
   confessed it to the Church. They confessed it to the hearers. And when
   they had done this, they proved the honesty of their confession, for
   they brought out all their charms and magic books, and made a great
   fire of them all! Why didn't they sell them to somebody? They were
   worth so much money. Yes, but if they sold them, they would have done
   mischief to somebody else--the best thing was to destroy these vipers
   by burning them in the fire! Moreover, they showed their hatred of sin
   by burning the books, as they could not have done in any other way. And
   yet again, the burning of these books was a mighty sermon to everybody
   who saw it! "What is this you are burning? Why, that book is worth
   fifty pounds!" "Oh, it is a magic book and we have done with it. The
   child of God has nothing to do with such things, so we have burnt
   them." That was a better sermon than even Paul, himself, could have
   preached upon this subject! Look at the loss the people sustained. I
   daresay many of them were poor. Two thousand pounds in those days was a
   much larger sum than it is now, but they lost it all cheerfully to get
   rid of the obnoxious books which once they had treasured in their
   houses! This is a triumph of the Gospel when men give up what they
   prize, and when they are willing to suffer great loss in order to get
   rid of great sin!

   Now I want the Gospel to prevail like that in this congregation and all
   around. I don't suppose you are, any of you, so silly and foolish--I
   don't imagine there is anybody here so insane as to believe in any
   magic or fortunetelling, or anything of that sort. If you did, I might
   speak upon the subject and show how detestable such a superstition is!
   But I do not suppose there is any such person here. But perhaps you
   have got something else. Mark you, if you have got anything wrong, if
   the Gospel saves your soul, you will give it up! I remember a good
   woman who heard her minister preach a Gospel sermon in which he was
   showing how the Gospel made men give up their sin. When he saw her a
   week after, he said, "Well, I saw you at the sermon. What did you
   remember of it?" She said, "I had got a bushel at home that was not of
   fair size, and I remembered to burn it when I got home." The best thing
   she could remember! And under William Daw-son's sermon, a certain
   travelling peddler heard about being "weighed in the balances and found
   wanting," and he took his yard stick and snapped it, and said, "I have
   done with it." Oh, that everybody in trade might do that, and burn the
   unjust thing and have done with it! But have you been accustomed to the
   lascivious song, or those three-volume beasts that come out every now
   and then--I cannot call them by any other name--which some people
   delight to read? Have done with them! Put them away! What have you to
   do with them? You will have enough of temptation in your own mind

   without going after these things! Is there any habit, any practice,
   that you have got that defiles your soul? If Christ loves you, and you
   come and trust in Him, you will make short work of it. Have done with
   it and have done with it forever!

   Perhaps it is some bad practice by which you get your living. Is it the
   Sunday morning trade? Then, Sir, if you believe in the Lord Jesus
   Christ and hope to be saved by Him, let those shutters never come down
   on another Sabbath! Say you, as those Ephesians did, "Cost us what it
   may, we will have nothing that grieves God. We will have nothing,
   however precious in money, that would damage our soul," for, "what
   shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own
   soul?" I have often looked at that question, and I have thought it
   might be cut down a good deal. What? Shall it profit a man if he gains
   the whole world? Why, you won't gain that! What would it profit you if
   you did, and lost your soul? But there are some people who gain only
   eighteen-pence on a Sunday! What shall it profit them if they gain
   eigh-teen-pence and lose their soul? It is miserable to think how cheap
   souls are! The devil buys souls in the gross, and can pay for them in
   coppers--men are so miserably ruined by small gains and small
   pleasures. Time was when he had to bait his trap with the world--now he
   can bait it with the smallest things. A smile, from some eyes will make
   men sell their souls, and a flattering word from some lips will make
   men cast away eternal blessedness! I pray God that you may be led to
   trust in Jesus Christ, alone, and find Him a Savior! And if you do, the
   next thing you will do will be to take a great broom and sweep out of
   your house all the obnoxious things that God hates, and you will say--

   "The dearest idol I have known,

   Whatever that idol be,

   Help me to tear it frown its throne,

   And worship only Thee."

   You will say, "I am a Christian, and I will have done with these
   things." God grant it may be so with many! No, with all of us, for
   Christ's sake! Amen.

A Gospel Promise

   (No. 3519)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 6, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And I will put My Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My
   statutes, and you will keep My judgments, and do them." Ezekiel 36:27.

   THE blessing here promised is one of the most essential that men can
   need, or that God can give. Without this blessing, all the other
   benefits of the Covenant would be null and void. It is vain to have a
   Savior if we have not spiritual power to believe in Him! Of what use is
   it to us that there should be provided precious promises if we have no
   faith worked in us by the Holy Spirit whereby we can grasp those
   promises, plead them in prayer and obtain their fulfillment? Without
   holiness, no man shall see the Lord, but holiness grows not in any
   human heart by nature. Therefore, without the Spirit of God, who is the
   Author of holiness, no man could ever become an heir of immortality, or
   enter into the rest which remains for the people of God! The Holy
   Spirit is needed for the very least form of spiritual life and is
   equally necessary for its highest development. Without the Holy Spirit,
   we cannot go through the first gate--and without the Spirit we cannot
   pass the last. No man can say in his heart that Jesus is the Christ but
   by the Holy Spirit--much less can any man attain to the perfection
   which is necessary to Heaven except through the work and power of the
   Spirit of the living God!

   I am always apprehensive lest by any means in my ministry I should even
   seem to obscure this blessed and indispensable agency of the Holy
   Spirit. Oh, if the Spirit of God is not honored--if He takes offense at
   our neglect--if He withdraw from us--of what use will be our
   congregations? Of what use our earnestness, even if we could maintain
   it? To what purpose your assembling for prayer if you had not any wish
   to gather? Without Him, we can do nothing! He breathes all the
   animation into the Christian Church! Jesus is gone from us into Heaven,
   but He continues to reign and rule in our midst by His Vicegerent, the
   Holy Spirit! Let us honor Him. Let us rely upon Him. Let us earnestly
   seek Him. Let it be ours to declare Him, those of us who have to speak,
   and yours to receive Him, those of you who have to hear!

   I. WHO IS THIS SPIRIT?

   He is spoken of in this text and often elsewhere. It is very necessary
   that we should talk over the commonplaces of the Gospel and the
   simplicities of the Word of God. I do not doubt but that there are some
   here who do not understand the Doctrine of the Divine Trinity. I have
   been annoyed--I would have been amused but for the sadness of the
   reflection--at the ignorance of some who have come in here and learned,
   for the first time, the most elementary Truths of the Gospel. They know
   them, now, and rejoice in them! They are even able to teach others. But
   when they first came, though not uneducated people, but well versed in
   some other matters--they had no more knowledge of the plan of
   Salvation, or even of the plain and simple fundamental Truths of the
   Gospel of Jesus--than if they had come here from the center of China,
   or some region into which our Bible had never been carried! Let it then
   be understood that the Holy Spirit, of whom we so often speak, is a
   Person. He is not a mere influence. We speak of "the influences of the
   Holy Spirit," and very properly so, but those influences proceed from a
   Person who works upon the minds of men by His influence. It is right to
   pray for the influences of the Holy Spirit, but it is not right to
   think of the Holy Spirit, Himself, as though He were an influence, for
   He is a Person!

   Actions are ascribed to Him which could not be ascribed to influences.
   He is said to be grieved, to be vexed, to have despite done unto Him.
   Wonderful things are ascribed to Him, which influences could not
   accomplish! The Spirit of God brooded over this earth when it was as
   yet without form and void--and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
   He brought order out of confusion. He garnished the heavens. The beauty
   of the Tabernacle is attributed to the skill that He Inspired. Or,
   turning to the holier Tabernacle of our Savior's body, it was formed
   and fashioned by the power of the Ho-

   ly Spirit! The holy Thing that was born of Mary was not born of natural
   generation, but by the energy of the Holy One of Israel. Not an
   influence, but a Person was the agent! And when our Lord was raised
   again from the dead, His Resurrection is ascribed in Scripture to the
   Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit worked many signs and wonders in the early
   Church. He enabled the Apostles to speak with many tongues. Through Him
   they had power to work many miracles. He even gave commandment to
   separate Paul and Barnabas for the work whereunto He had called them.
   And still, Beloved, He is in the Church and we have fellowship with
   Him! We commune with Him! We can bear our witness that He makes
   intercession for us with groans that cannot be uttered, that He helps
   our infirmities and performs for us a thousand offices of love which
   make us feel, experimentally and consciously, that the agent of such
   things is a very Person!

   He is, moreover, God--truly God! Never let us think lightly of the Holy
   Spirit, as though He were in any secondary sense, Divine. In your
   Baptism the three names were put together. You were baptized into the
   triple name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Take
   care that the three Persons be always associated in your minds with
   equal affection and with equal awe! The Benediction, which so
   constantly concludes our worship, gives to each His place-- "May the
   Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of the Father, and the
   fellowship or communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all." The Holy
   Spirit, then, is Divine! We do not now attempt to prove that which it
   is our business at present dogmatically to assert. The thing is capable
   of abundant proof from Holy Writ. Let it suffice that we teach you the
   fact. How is it that the Father is God, that the Son is God and that
   the Holy Spirit is God--and yet that there are not three Gods, but one
   God? I cannot tell you. I know it is so, for so it is revealed--but how
   it is so, it is not for us to guess because it is not revealed or
   explained. Our understanding can adventure as far as the testimony and
   no farther! Many attempts have been made by Divines to find parallels
   in Nature to the Unity and the Trinity of God, but they all seem to me,
   to fail. Perhaps the very best one is that of St. Patrick, who, when
   preaching to the Irish and wishing to explain this matter, plucked a
   shamrock and showed them its three leaves all in one--three, yet one.
   Yet there are flaws and faults even in that illustration! It does not
   meet the case. It is a Doctrine to be emphatically asserted as it is
   expounded in that Athanasian Creed, the soundness of whose teaching I
   do not question, for I believe it all, though I shrink with horror from
   the abominable anathema which asserts that a man who hesitates to
   endorse it, will, "without doubt perish everlastingly."

   It is a matter to be reverently accepted as it stands in the Word of
   God and to be faithfully studied as it has been understood by the most
   scrupulous and intelligent Christians of succeeding generations. We are
   not to think of the Father as though anything could detract from the
   homage due to Him as originally and essentially Divine, nor of the only
   begotten Son of the Father as though He were not "God over all, blessed
   forever," nor of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father and the
   Son, as though He had not all the attributes of Deity! We must abide by
   this, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is one Jehovah." But we must
   still hold to it that in three Persons He is to be worshipped, though
   He is but One in His essence. Understand, then, you who know but little
   of the Doctrines of the Gospel, that you must worship the Holy Spirit
   and exercise your faith on Him as God! Lay particular stress upon this,
   because it is written, "Whoever shall speak a word against the Son of
   Man, it shall be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the Holy
   Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the
   world to come." Such awful sanctity surrounds the Spirit of God! As I
   think of Him, I seem to see Sinai in a blaze with a bound set around
   about--and I hear a Voice that says to me, "Draw not near here, for
   this is holy ground."

   That unpardonable sin against the Holy Spirit, I know not what it
   is--in vain might I assay to define it. It stands like a beacon, as if
   God saw that an ungodly and stiff-necked generation would vex the Holy
   Spirit and venture far in blasphemy! Therefore, while all manner of
   blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, the sin against the Holy Spirit
   shall never be forgiven. Take heed you do not harden your heart, lest
   you should commit it! I do not believe you have. I know you have not if
   you desire to be saved. I am sure you have not if you are willing to
   come and put your trust in Jesus Christ. Still, I admonish you to take
   care and treat with reverence the very thought of the Holy Spirit, the
   Comforter, the Instructor of your souls. Your second question will be--

   II. HOW DOES HE FULFILL THIS PROMISE?

   We understand by these words that those who formerly loved sin shall be
   made to love righteousness. That those who found it hard, at one time,
   to break off their evil ways, shall be induced to run with alacrity in
   the way of God's Commandments. Now this is a great thing to be promised
   and a very great thing to be obtained! By no human power could it

   be brought to pass. As easily might the Blackamoor change his skin to
   whiteness, or the leopard get rid of his spots, as could the man who is
   accustomed to do evil reverse the entire current of his habits and
   instincts--and learn to do well! The Divine Power that first fashioned
   the soul of man must re-mold it. Only the Creator who made the
   instrument can re-tune it, or restore its harmony! No unskillful hands
   can mend it. People sometimes quibble at the Doctrine of Human
   Impotence, but I can assure you that the actual evidence is far more
   convincing than the abstract theory! The practical pastoral experience
   that some of us have had would soon convince anyone that there is ample
   evidence of its truthfulness. We meet with those who have been a little
   awakened at our Prayer Meetings and revival services. What, do you
   think, is the first thing we have to concern about them? Why, some of
   them have never been in the habit of thinking about their souls,
   before, and the moment they do begin to think, like a lad introduced
   into a carpenter's shop who has never seen tools, before, they cut
   themselves with every tool they attempt to handle! These poor souls
   never were introduced to the spiritual world. Self-examination is a
   novelty to them. If they think of sin, it drives them to despair! Or if
   they think of mercy, that drives them to presumption! Whatever Truth of
   God we put before them, they misuse and pervert it. They do not seem to
   have the sense or the wit to use any Truth in a right way! You may
   teach the young enquirer with much earnestness, but you will find it
   difficult to guide him.

   For instance, if he seems resolved to despair, you shall try to comfort
   him and use as many arguments as you can, but he will despair if he has
   made up his mind to do it! Some of these remind me of certain game that
   sportsmen try to hunt out of their holes. It seems in vain to send the
   ferret after them. When I have used arguments to get them out of one
   hole, they take refuge in another! And when I have stopped up scores of
   holes and have said to myself, "I shall have you now-- you cannot
   answer that!" Suddenly they seem to have found out quite another branch
   of lies and delusions. They are gone from me and all my work is lost!
   Ah, then it is that the pastor feels that he must have the power of the
   Holy Spirit to help him, or else even the awakened and anxious sinner
   will evade conversion, put away from himself eternal life and perish in
   his sin! Yes, Brothers and Sisters, experience will often prove more
   than controversy is prone to allow of the necessity of work of the Holy
   Spirit! And if in merely dealing with the elementary lessons of
   religion we find such palpable evidence of human inability, how much
   more is this the case in the matter of making a lover of sin become a
   lover of holiness? You may show him the proprieties of morality. You
   may lay before him the inevitable results of sin. You may charm him
   with the rewards of virtue, but the adder is too deaf for all your
   charming--and when you have charmed, and charmed, and charmed again--he
   still retains his venom and is still an adder!

   But how does the Holy Spirit effect this? He operates, it is true, in
   many ways. He does it often by His quickening power. The Holy Spirit is
   the Author of all spiritual life. Speak of regeneration, the Holy
   Spirit is the Regenerator. No man can receive that Divine Life which
   comes into him at the new birth except by the Spirit of God. We are
   raised from our death in sin into a new and holy life by the working of
   the Holy Spirit, and by that alone. Now, if someone here, hitherto
   incapable of a holy life, or of serving God right because of his
   natural depravity, should be quickened by the Holy Spirit, what a
   change would be at once worked upon him! What the spiritually dead man
   cannot do, the spiritually enlivened man can readily perform. How the
   Spirit quickens we know not. "The wind blows where it will, and you
   hear the sound thereof, but cannot tell from where it comes, or where
   it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit." The effects are
   visible enough. You soon perceive that the man who was callous, without
   feeling, without emotion, becomes tender of conscience, eager in
   desires and sensitive in his anxieties. He becomes, in fact, a living
   man, though he was steeped in death before!

   The Holy Spirit continues to make a man practically new by the
   illumination He bestows. The man is blind--the Holy Spirit touches his
   eye with heavenly eye-salve and he begins to see. The sinner, with the
   Bible in his hand, though anxious to understand it in a measure, makes
   a sorry muddle of its Doctrines and precepts apart from the
   instructions of that blessed Commentator--the Holy Spirit! The Bible is
   full of the Light of God, but the heart of man is very dark. To what
   purpose is the Scripture opened to the understanding if the eyes of the
   understanding are covered with a thick film? It is the Holy Spirit who
   irradiates the Truth of God which He has revealed broadcast over every
   object that lies in our path. In reading the Bible to find comfort and
   direction, take care to lift up your hearts to Him who wrote it! As an
   author best understands his own books, so will the Spirit, who Inspired
   the volume, let you at once into the secret meaning of that which the
   pens of Inspired men have recorded. Wait upon God for instruction--His
   instruction is sure to lead you to holiness, for He instructs you in
   the evil of sin! He lets you see its heinousness, its demerit, its
   ingratitude and infamy. He instructs you in the beauty of holiness and
   shows you the example of your Master. He teaches you the Law of God and
   writes it upon the fleshly tablets of your heart. In this way, as an
   Illuminator as well as a Quickener, He makes us run in the ways of
   God's statutes!

   Moreover, the Holy Spirit operates as a Comforter. Many men are
   wretched by reason of their sins, yet unwilling to renounce them. We
   have known people continue in present transgression because they are
   utterly hopeless of ever being forgiven their misdeeds in the past. But
   when the Spirit of God breathes holy comfort into the desponding
   sinner's mind, he then says to himself, "I will not fling myself away
   after all. It is not meet that I, who have a better destiny before me,
   should live like those who have resolved to follow their own lusts,
   reckless of consequences--those who have made a covenant with Hell and
   a league with death! No, a thousand times no! If God does all this for
   me, and brings His dear Son to me, and tells me of pardons bought with
   blood, then away shall go my old sins and henceforth it shall be my joy
   to serve with all my might the Heavenly Friend who has been so kind to
   me." The Holy Spirit is always to His people the Comforter. Are any of
   you sad? Does that sadness make you unbelieving? Does the unbelief act
   upon you as a temptation to sin? Go to the Comforter to take away the
   root of the mischief! So shall you run in the way of God's Commandments
   because He has enlarged your heart and guided your footsteps!

   The Holy Spirit also operates in the hearts of some as an Intercessor,
   helping their prayers. Some of you are downcast and desponding because
   you cannot pray. "Oh," you think, "if I could but pray!" What strange
   ideas possess people's mind as to praying! One who took my hand the
   other day said to me, "I wish I could pray as you do, Sir, but pray I
   cannot." Poor soul, when I saw his tears and heard his cries to God,
   very broken as they were, I wished that I could pray as he did, then!
   What is the use of fit words, fine sentences, fluent speech? These seem
   to me full often to be such deceitful acquirements that I would gladly
   dispense with them, if I might stammer out my soul's desires and feel
   myself to be all the more sincere because I lacked expression to clothe
   my thought! Oh, no--the Lord does not require your long addresses! A
   groan, a sigh, a sob that seems to swell in your soul and become too
   big to find a way of escape--that is prayer! When you cannot pray,
   remember the Spirit also helps our infirmities. It is His office to
   utter groans for us which we cannot utter. And by enabling the man to
   pray, He enables the man to be holy, for prayer is a mainstay of
   holiness. To draw near to God, the Fountain of all perfection, is to be
   helped against besetting sin--and the blessed Helper in prayer also
   becomes, in this respect, a Help to us in the paths of righteousness.

   I do hope that any of you who have been saying, "I cannot do this,"
   and, "I cannot do that," will understand that it is quite true that you
   cannot--but it is equally true that the Holy Spirit can help you to do
   all things! You can do everything through His almighty aid! Wait upon
   Him with earnest desires and say to Him, "Come, Holy Spirit, help a
   poor feeble worm. Help me to mourn my sin. Help me to look to Jesus
   with the eyes of faith. Help me to give up my sins. Help me when I am
   tempted, that I may withstand the subtle arts of Satan. Help me to
   overcome my bad temper, to get rid of the pride and naughtiness of my
   heart. Kill my sloth. Take away my disposition to put off and
   procrastinate. Enable me to decide for Christ right now and to come,
   all guilty as I am, and wash in the Fountain of His precious blood,
   that I may be saved." I tell you it is the Holy Spirit's office to do
   this! He is never so happy, if I may use such a phrase concerning the
   ever-blessed One, as when He is thus, by His quickening, His
   illuminating, His comforting influences, bringing poor guilty souls to
   Jesus and, by Him, to the paths of holiness!

   Furthermore, one of the Holy Spirit's proper offices is to sanctify the
   people of God. Jesus Christ gives us a justifying righteousness which
   is imputed to us--the Holy Spirit gives us a sanctifying righteousness
   which is imparted to us. The blessed Jesus brings to us His own
   righteousness and clothes us with it. The Holy Spirit works in us a
   personal conformity to the will of God in our hearts, productive of
   fruit in our lives as a sequel to that obedience even unto death,
   wherewith Christ made satisfaction for our offenses and discharged the
   high obligation of that obedience we owed. This holiness is not the
   holiness of Christ, as some vainly say, but it is a personal holiness
   worked in us by the operation of the Holy Spirit. You, dear Hearers,
   have perhaps said to yourselves, "I cannot be saved because I am not
   holy." The truth is you cannot be holy because you are not saved--being
   saved comes first! Holiness is never the root--it is always the fruit!
   It is not the cause, it is the effect! You must come to Jesus as you
   are and trust Him--and then He will give you the Holy Spirit to work in
   you the new heart, the new desire--and to make you a new creature. You
   say, "I cannot make myself holy." That is true. You ought to do so, but
   the power is gone and alas, the will likewise! But if God has given you
   the will,

   He points you to Him with whom the power is rested, namely, the Holy
   Spirit, who will dwell in you and sanctify you through the Word of
   Truth and the application of the precious blood and water which flowed
   from the side of Christ.

   Nor must I omit to notice that one of the Spirit's great works is to
   dwell in His people. The Holy Spirit dwells in every believer in
   Christ! He has never been absent from him since he became a disciple.
   We may invoke His Presence as we sing--

   "Come Holy Spirit, heavenly dove, With all Your quickening powers."

   But that is a prayer for His special manifestation. The Holy Spirit is
   here. He lives in the Church. He has come as a Comforter who shall
   abide with us forever. He dwells in the bodies of His people--God is in
   His Temple. And, mark you, it is by this indwelling that the holiness
   of the Believer is kept up. If the Holy Spirit left him, he would
   return, like a dog to his vomit, but because the Holy Spirit looks out
   of these eyes and throbs in this hear and moves these hands, when the
   man is freely obedient to the Divine Power, the man is kept in the
   paths of integrity and his end is everlasting life! To gather up all
   these thoughts in one, whatever offices the Holy Spirit sustains to
   God's people, the result of all these offices will be to keep the man
   from going back to his old ways and to cause him to walk in God's
   statutes, and to keep God's judgments and do them! Do you wish, then,
   to be saved from sin and to be made holy? Look to the wounds of the
   bleeding Savior and remember that He has promised to give you the Holy
   Spirit, by whom you shall be made holy and kept in holiness till you
   stand hereafter without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, before the
   Eternal Throne! In closing, I want to--

   III. SAY A FEW GOOD AND COMFORTABLE WORDS TO SOME OF YOU WHO MAY BE
   ANXIOUS TO POSSESS THIS SPIRIT OF GOD IN YOUR HEARTS.

   "Ah," complains one, "the Holy Spirit would never look on me!" Why do
   you have such a thought? Do you think to honor Him by such reflections?
   Far rather do you shame yourself. Know you not that He has looked on
   many such as you are and they are alive to tell of His condescending
   love? Will you look to Jesus? Will you cast yourself upon the Great
   Surety who has deigned to become the Scapegoat for sinners? If so, the
   Holy Spirit has looked on you! The first desire you have towards God
   comes from Him! These inward strivings which you feel now (tenderly do
   I wish that you may not stifle or quench them) come from Him! That
   fear, that anxiety, that longing may be and I trust they are, the
   initiative of a blessed work of the Holy Spirit within your soul! Judge
   not of the Holy Spirit as though He were reluctant. Nehemiah spoke of
   the Spirit of God as "the GoodSpirit." So He is! He is the very essence
   of goodness, taking goodness in the sense of benevolence. He is good to
   men, full of generous love towards them. We read of "the love of the
   Spirit." Sweet words! What must it be to appreciate them and to prove
   their meaning! The love of the Spirit! I marvel that the Spirit of God
   should come down into the valley of dry bones. I wonder that He should
   have contact with such corruption as ours and make us live! I am
   surprised that He has not left us long ago, dullards as we are in His
   school, yet He patiently teaches us. It is amazing to me that He should
   dwell in such poor temples as our clay bodies. Still, He does. He
   condescendingly abides with us. You speak of the love of Jesus in
   coming down to earth and enduring all its misery and shame--you cannot
   speak too well of that--but do not forget that the Holy Spirit has been
   abiding here these 1,800 years and still the dispensation of His
   government lasts--He is still waiting and striving, persuading,
   preciously illuminating, grandly quickening! Thus He will continue to
   do until the Lord Jesus, Himself, shall descend from Heaven with a
   shout and the dispensation of the Holy Spirit shall be perfected in the
   world to come! The Holy Spirit, then, is a good Spirit, and that should
   encourage you to go to Him with a full confidence in His Person and
   works.

   He is sometimes called, "the free Spirit." David says, "Uphold me with
   Your free Spirit." He is not bound by our bondage. He is not retrained,
   thank God, by the restriction of our desires. He is not withheld, even
   though our inability and our iniquity entangle us. He waits not for
   man, neither tarries He for the sons of men. As the dew comes in the
   morning on the dumb grass that cannot speak for it. As the stiff breeze
   blows over the silent mountains that cannot ask for it. And as on the
   sea, which cannot lift up its billows until the wind shall stir them,
   which comes unsought, unasked--even so is the Spirit's advent! So
   freely in real truth does He come. Oh, you vilest of sinners, you
   outcast, you who are turned off by those who once loved you--the Holy
   Spirit can even come to you! He is a free Spirit--not even your sins
   can withhold Him! He can conquer your desperate depravity and come to
   reign and rule in your breast where devils have held a carnival these
   many years!

   I adore the power of God that He exerts over the minds of men, insomuch
   as that while I stand here to preach to you, willing or not willing as
   you may be to heed His message, my Lord and Master will have His own
   way! What though you may be in the most unfit state to attend to the
   Gospel call--though you may have come to ridicule the preacher, or
   catch him tripping in his speech, or it may be you have designed to
   spend a merry hour--the Divine Fiat is mightier than your fitful mood!
   How often has the Eternal Archer shot His arrows through and through
   the scorners and left them as though they were dead, and then, having
   touched them with His life-giving finger, He has said, "Live!" The
   change has been worked, though they knew nothing of it at the time! The
   Lord, according to His good pleasure, has done the work and thus can
   this blessed free Spirit effect His purpose. Oh, my beloved Brothers
   and Sisters, pray for the unsaved! Pray for sinners, you who can pray!
   Full often have I thought what a blessed thing it is that the Spirit of
   God can obtain admission where we cannot. There is a house that is
   closed and barred against the Gospel. The squire of the parish,
   perhaps, says that any of his servants going to the Meeting House, he
   will discharge. He will take care that he will have none of this
   Methodism anywhere in his district! Very well, Sir, if you propose to
   keep it out, you will need to have a great many watchmen, for, you
   know, if there is a sweet perfume in your house, you must use your
   diligence to keep it hermetically sealed, or else it will escape and
   diffuse its odor through every room by degrees! The name of Jesus
   Christ is "like ointment poured forth"--it has a wonderful
   diffusiveness about it!

   Ere long the squire will discover that one of his servants has caught
   the sweet infection. Gladly would he turn her away, were she not such a
   good nurse-girl that he cannot afford to lose her! And I have noticed
   that there is a Divine contagion in the Grace of God that brings
   salvation. In families, neighborhoods, townships and great cities it
   will spread with strange rapidity! One or two conversions, like drops
   of rain, portend a shower! I knew a man who burned all the Bibles he
   had in his house--at least he thoughthe had burned them all--but he had
   two daughters who kept their books secreted under their pillows. When
   he found it out, he was mad with rage. What he was going to do, I do
   not know. His wife told him at length that she was of their mind and
   took their part. "Ah, well," he said, "it is a nuisance that I cannot
   live without being pestered with this religion." Yes, and by the Grace
   of God they shall not "live without being pestered." If they will not
   come and hear the Word from the minister, they shall hear it somehow
   else! A tract shall find him over whose head a sermon flies--and half a
   sentence shall break a rock in pieces where appeals from the pulpit
   might have been of no use! Have good courage, then, you who seek the
   salvation of others, and you that are afar off from God, yourselves--do
   not despair for the Spirit of God is a free Spirit--He can come even to
   you!

   Very powerful, too, is the Spirit of God, as well as good and free.
   There is no form of human obstinacy which He cannot overcome. Some
   operations of the Holy Spirit may be resisted and defeated. This I say
   without feeling that I cast any slur upon His Deity. A man, though he
   may be ever so strong, need not put out all his strength, and when he
   puts out only a little of his strength a child may be able to overcome
   him. He may, perhaps, intend that it should be so. So the Holy Spirit,
   in His common operations is vexed, and grieved, and quenched by the
   ungodly. Quite otherwise when He comes to "the exceeding greatness of
   His power to us who believe," or when the Lord makes bare His arm in
   the eyes of all the people--then the Spirit comes as a Spirit of
   Irresistible Power! Who shall stay His hand, or say unto Him, "What are
   You doing?" See how Saul of Tarsus, foaming at the mouth against the
   Church of God, cries, "What must I do to be saved? Who are You, Lord?"
   Soon he rises up to be led by the hand for three days in brokenness of
   heart to seek for the Light of God's Countenance! How quickly can God
   turn the most fierce persecutors into the most earnest preachers of the
   Gospel! Be of good heart, dear Friends, for God's cause in the world!
   We shall see yet greater things if we do but ask for them in faith and
   faithfully expect them.

   If God does not raise up good men in the colleges to preach the Gospel,
   He will find them in the warehouses and offices of our merchants. Or
   failing these, He will call them from the dregs of the population--it
   may be even from the dens and kens of thieves if nowhere else! Who
   knows but He may provoke us to jealousy by a people of a strange
   tongue. My Master knew how to find Luther among the monks and to fish
   out some of the bravest Reformers from among the idolatrous priests!
   And He can do the same again! The Church may come to a very bad tide,
   but there never shall be such a bad tide but the Church, like a galley
   with oars, shall be able to float! She shall not strike on the rocks.
   Have hope, you soldiers of Christ! While the ministry of the Holy
   Spirit can be invoked, never whisper of despair! Oh, Sinner, have hope
   for yourself, willful and wicked as you may have been! If you cannot
   amend your ways and change your heart, He can do it for you! The iron
   bands of habit He can snap. The adamantine net of lasciviousness He can
   break in pieces! From the

   degrading abominations of drunkenness He can extricate you! All the
   charms of worldliness He can dissolve! He can set you free, though you
   are now a captive fast in the inner prison with your feet in the
   stocks! While the Holy Spirit lives, while Jesus intercedes, while the
   Father is willing to receive prodigals, let no one despair! Grace makes
   the most worthless creatures welcome to the most inestimable blessings!
   What Paul said to saints I venture to say to sinners, "Covet earnestly
   the best gifts." Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN 14:21-31.

   In this "sacred farewell" talk of our Lord's, He gives us many a
   Revelation of the soul's way of communion with Him.

   21, 22. He who has My commandments, andkeeps them, he it is who loves
   Me: andhe who loves Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love
   him, and will manifest Myself to him. Judas said unto Him, not
   Iscariot, Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself unto us, and
   not unto the world?Many a time have we asked that question with great
   admiration of the special Sovereign Grace of God, that He should
   manifest Himself to us, and not to the world. It is an unanswerable
   question. It is, "even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your
   sight."

   23. Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man loves Me, he will keep
   My words: and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and
   make Our abode with him. Where the Grace of God has created love
   between us and Christ, there is a window through which Christ can
   manifest Himself to us. Why He gave us that love, we do not know, but
   when He has given us that love He will not deny us communion with
   Himself.

   24-26. He that loves Me not, keeps not My sayings: and the word which
   you hear is not Mine, but the Father's who sent Me. These things have I
   spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which
   is the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach
   you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I
   have said unto you.The Holy Spirit does not teach us any new Doctrine!
   Fix that in your minds, for in the present age we have numbers of
   persons who talk about being inspired with the Holy Spirit, and who
   come with all kinds of crudities and fooleries. Believe them not! The
   Holy Spirit says no other and no more than the Lord Jesus Christ,
   Himself, said, "He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to
   your remembrance whatsoever I have said to you." The canon of
   Revelation is closed! None can add to it without a curse. Do not accept
   any testimony that would add to it. Keep to what is here found and pray
   the Holy Spirit to lead you into the clear understanding of it.

   27, 28. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the
   world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither
   let it be afraid. You have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and
   come again unto you. If you loved Me, you would rejoice, because I
   said, I go unto the Father: for My Father is greater than I. Christ
   had, Himself, less than the Father in His state of humiliation. And now
   He is returning to the Father to be re-clothed with honor and majesty.
   Should we not rejoice in that?

   29-31. And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that when it is
   come to pass, you might believe. Hereafter I will not talk much with
   you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in Me. But
   that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave
   Me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go. And He went to His
   death bravely determined to do the Father's will, though it meant the
   drinking up of that bitter cup which made His very soul to tremble
   within Him! God give us such love to Christ as Christ had to the
   Father!

Jerusalem the Guilty

   (No. 3520)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 13, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "It cannot be that a Prophet should perish out of Jerusalem." Luke
   13:33.

   I CAN scarcely tell you under what singular feelings I am led to adopt
   this text. It has entered my mind, whispered in my ears and I might
   almost say, it has haunted my thoughts, for all the day long has it
   been fresh in my memory, and again and again it has recurred to me in
   the night watches. There is no comfort that I can extract from the
   meditation, and not much instruction that I can deduce from the
   oracular sentence. Conscience, however, lays on me a strong constraint.
   Any portion from the Word of God that comes forcibly home to my own
   soul, I am prone to accept, as it were, in trust for your sakes. So I
   aim to deliver unto you that which I also received. Be it void of
   comfort or charged with rebuke, God grant it may be acknowledged to
   your profit and accepted to His praise!

   "It cannot be that a Prophet should perish out of Jerusalem." Probably
   this was a proverb among the Jews which our Savior used and endorsed.
   For many years Jerusalem had been stained with the blood of Prophets.
   These godly men might have lived securely in the rural districts of
   Judah and among her various towns and hamlets, and though sometimes
   annoyed, never exposed to violence--but so had the seat ofjudgment
   become the throne of iniquity that vengeance was reeked where justice
   should have ruled! Jerusalem, the metropolis of government, the center
   of religion and the priests, became notorious as the scene of judicial
   murder and vindictive martyrdom! It had been, through a number of
   years, the place where one after another of God's servants had been
   stoned and put to death. Our Savior seems to have felt that He was safe
   while in Herod's jurisdiction, but that when He got to Jerusalem, He
   was in imminent peril from conspirators--that there a baptism of blood
   awaited Him, when His life would be sacrificed and He would become, as
   it were, the Prince of Martyrs--an offering of the noblest life, a
   shedding of the richest blood that ever was poured out on the altar at
   Jerusalem! It seems strange that Jerusalem should have sunk so low as
   to monopolize the sin of murdering the Prophets--that it should have
   become renowned for persecution and vindictive cruelty--a city within
   whose walls God's servants might look in vain for shelter. Where
   popular feeling and the public courts were alike against them. Where
   summary indictment and certain conviction were sure to be their lot!
   "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem! You that stone the Prophets and kill them
   who are sent to you!"

   From generation to generation had they thus framed mischief and done
   violence--until our Lord accuses and holds them guilty of the slaughter
   of His servants from "the blood of righteous Abel unto that of
   Zacharias, the son of Bara-chias, whom they slew between the Temple and
   the altar." What a fearful contrast this presents to the name that
   Jerusalem had received, and the position that had been assigned to her!
   Was she not called Jerusalem, the place of righteousness and of peace?
   Her bards had praised her in glowing sonnets as, "beautiful for
   situation, the joy of the whole earth." How did the Psalmist draw
   lively, lovely images of her security, surrounded by mountains that
   served as natural fortresses to protect her! And did he not even
   picture the little hills that environed her as companions of the
   mountain on which the Temple stood? "Why leap you so, you high hills?
   This is the hill which God delights to dwell in." Where else did
   acceptable sacrifices smoke? As for the altars of the high places, they
   were an abomination to the Lord! The one altar at Jerusalem God had
   ordained for acceptable sacrifice. There the tribes came up to worship.
   It was the meeting place and rallying point of all the families of
   Israel at their annual festivals--

   "Unto her gates, with joys unknown

   Did Judah's tribes repair.

   The Son of David held His throne

   And sat in judgment there."

   Her mountain was illustrious in history. It was on one of her pinnacles
   that Abraham drew the knife to slay his son! And on the spot where the
   plague was stopped in David's day when the outstretched hand of the
   angel was arrested at the threshing floor of Araunah, the Jebusite, was
   built, stone by stone, the Temple where God delighted to dwell! It was
   the source from where light went streaming through the land as from the
   sun, and at the same time it was the great lake into which the rivers
   of sacred prayer and praise constantly flowed, gleaming in their
   fullness! Oh, Jerusalem, your very name was dear to the captives as
   they sat mournfully down by Babylon's streams and wept, saying, one
   with another, "If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget
   her cunning. If I do not remember you, let my tongue cleave to the roof
   of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joys." You seem so
   fair a city, so perfect a chrysolite! Your halls seem so truly made of
   agate, and your gates of carbuncle that in your glory we see a type of
   the abode of the saints of God--

   "Jerusalem, my happy home! Name ever dear to me. When shall my labors
   have an end, In joy, and peace, and thee?"

   And has it come to this? Well, then, might the Savior, whom you did
   despise and reject, weep over you! Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Has it come to
   this? "You kill the Prophets and stone them that are sent to you." Has
   it come to this? No marvel that your house is left unto you desolate,
   that the holy city is given up to the abomination of desolation, and is
   left to be trodden under foot by the Gentiles! Has it come to this? Oh,
   horror of horrors! What sorrows are too sad and heart-rending to follow
   at the heels of sin! Look, my Brothers and Sisters--that same sin which
   once cast down Lucifer from his throne, degraded him from the royalties
   of Heaven and doomed him to the Pit that burns with fire and brimstone
   forever--that same sin has plucked this pearl from the regal diadem of
   the King of Kings, subjected it to the direst dishonor and made it a
   byword in the earth! So is her beauty spoiled! So is her sacredness and
   such are the wages of sin, and such the recompense of transgressions!
   As you think of this city of the great king converted into a place of
   butchery and a shamble for Prophets, I would have you recollect that--

   I. THE LIKE RIGHTEOUS RETRIBUTION IS STILL INFLICTED WHEREVER SIN SEEKS
   SHELTER UNDER THE SOLEMN SANCTIONS OF A SOUNDING PROFESSION!

   Now and then we are startled. Someone who had stood foremost among the
   saints has all of a sudden excited public gaze, conspicuous as a fiend.
   I remember such a man. He preached the Gospel and seemed to preach it
   with intense sincerity. At any rate, there was such fervor in his
   manner that zeal seemed to animate his heart. His words moved many--
   souls were converted under his ministry, souls that shall make glad the
   angels of God throughout eternity! He comforted the saints and many
   disciples were refreshed by his discourses. But in an evil hour he
   turned aside. His fall was precipitate. The sink was abysmal. Of
   drunkards he became one of the worst! Of swearers the most profane!
   Among licentious the most lewd! No slave of Satan was ever more in
   earnest to destroy himself and to do his black master's bidding than
   that same man who once ministered at the altar of God and appeared to
   be a star in the right hand of Christ! And why may not such a collapse
   occur to me? And why may it not occur to you, my Brother? Every man, it
   has well been said, has not a soul of crystal whereby other men can
   read his actions. You look fair. You seem to be a saint. Yet there may
   be a worm in the center of your fair plant after all! Sudden death
   often surprises those who appear to be in sound health, though slow
   disease has long been sapping the strength of their system. Be not
   deceived by appearances--make sure of your salvation! Jerusalem killed
   the Prophets. Maybe you will likewise belie your pretensions to virtue.
   You have heard of a woman out of whom seven devils were cast. Did you
   never hear of one into whom seven devils entered?

   There she stands. Never woman seemed more pure! Never penitent wept
   more sparkling tears! Like another Mary Magdalene, she washed her
   Savior's feet with her tears. Yes, she seems to sit at Jesus' feet and
   love Him with all her heart. Earnest in season and out of season, we
   admire her. But the time of trial comes--that time which tests the
   metal whether it is gold or not. She gives her heart to another than
   her Savior. Once led astray, no lips are more defiling than hers! No
   feet run more swiftly in the way of the Destroyer. It happened unto her
   that she did in theory know the way of righteousness, but the
   gracefulness of her profession was not the Grace of God in truth--so
   presently she turned aside, and she, who seemed to be a Hannah, turned
   out to be a Jezebel! And she who once could sing, as we thought, the
   grateful song of Mary, must hence forever weep a doleful Miserere!Take
   care, my Sister, that you are safely built upon the Rock of Ages! As
   Jerusalem killed the Prophets, so may you. I say so because I find it
   in God's Word.

   Have we not too often seen instances of those who were regular outward
   attendants upon God's House who seemed to adorn the earthly courts and
   bid fair for Heaven? Who rejoiced continually in holy things with a
   full measure of assurance and rather frowned on some of the Brethren
   who were sometimes depressed and filled with doubt and fears--have not
   we seen you very Church members become the victims of some darling sin,
   the prey of some base lust which has driven you like bullocks to the
   slaughter? "There is a sin unto death." Our eyes have seen the
   mischief! Our ears have listened to the tale! Our hearts have been
   pained by the recital hundreds of times! From my youth up I have felt
   indescribable terror when I heard of such an one who seemed to be a
   pillar in the Church moved from his place--"Demas has forsaken me,
   having loved this present evil world." When I have heard of it,
   sometimes I have been ready to wail with the Prophet, "Howl, fir tree,
   for the cedar has fallen." Those who seemed better than ourselves, more
   gracious and far more gifted, have turned aside--and we have felt that
   it is only by a miracle of Grace we have not done the same--

   "So stones hang in the air So sparks in ocean live, Kept alive with
   death so near, I to God the glory give."

   Jerusalem killed the Prophets, and there is that secret wickedness in
   the hearts of every one of us that would have made us do the same a
   thousand times--that would have turned us from saints into devils, if
   the constraining, preserving Grace of God had not defended us! Let us,
   then, humbly acknowledge all this. Let us carefully search ourselves to
   see whether we are in the faith and then let us gratefully bless that
   mighty hand which, having begun its gracious work, will not leave us
   until it has perfectly performed its purpose and fulfilled in us all
   the designs of love! Looked at thus, this passage conveys a very solemn
   warning. How terrible must be the deathbed of a man who, after having
   made a profession, and perhaps preached the Gospel, has become an
   apostate! Can we picture the siege of Jerusalem? I believe that all
   human rhetoric must fail in the description and that if a painter
   dipped his brush in blood, he could not sketch the horrors of that
   awful time! If those days had not been shortened, surely the whole race
   had been swept away! There never was and never shall be until the Last
   Tremendous Day, anything that can be paralleled with the destruction of
   Jerusalem under Vespasian and Titus! In like manner, there is nothing,
   I think, that can parallel--certainly nothing that can exceed--the
   horrors of the dying bed of an apostate. Did you ever read the story of
   Francis Spire, or of John Auld, in the days of the last nonconforming
   reformation in England? If you ever read the stories of these
   deathbeds, they will ring in your ears at night, and make you cry out,
   "O God, if I am damned, let it not be as an apostate! If I must perish,
   yet let me not perish as one who, like a dog, returns to his vomit, or
   like a sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire." Jerusalem
   stoned the Prophets! You young men who are just putting on your
   harness, boast not as though you were taking it off!

   Beginners in the way of Grace, it is a great and solemn Truth of God
   that every child of God will hold on until the end, but it is an
   equally solemn Truth that many who profess to be the Lord's are
   self-deceivers and will turn out apostates after all! They will go back
   to the beggarly elements from which they appear to have escaped and
   begin to stone the Prophets, whom once they professed to reverence and
   love! How dreadful their doom! To see the Lord when fire blazes before
   Him, and the clouds form a chariot beneath Him--when "He shall come,
   but not the same as once in lowliness He came"--when He shall appear in
   rainbow wreath and clouds of storm, how dreadful will it be to those
   who turned their backs upon Him! In vain shall they call upon the
   mountains and rocks to cover them! They must face Him whom they
   deserted. They must be arraigned before Him whom they treacherously
   betrayed. Oh, how they will fall in speechless, helpless, hopeless
   dismay before Him! And oh, how He will trample on them in His anger
   because they trampled on His blood in their treachery and crucified to
   themselves the Lord of Life afresh! God save us from their eternal
   woes, for of all bitter remorse and fell despair, theirs must be the
   most tormenting! The privileges they enjoyed aggravate the perdition in
   which they are engulfed. Down from Heaven's gates they are thrust into
   Hell by the back door! Their faces, once towards Jerusalem the Golden,
   now confront the accursed Gehenna! Far from the rayless, pathless
   outlook with which they bid farewell to mortal life to the dire reality
   of their dreaded doom they are launched forth, "wandering stars, for
   whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever." Such are trees
   without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots! Such are raging
   waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame! "God deliver us from
   their character and their conduct, lest we reap the consequence that is
   sure to close their career!" Now to draw a fresh lesson, let me remind
   you of--

   II. THE UTTER USELESSNESS OF OUTWARD PRIVILEGES UNLESS THERE IS INWARD
   PURITY.

   Never was a city more richly endowed or more highly privileged than was
   Jerusalem of old. As we have already said, it was the city of the great
   king. There all the festivals were held. Her priests were her pride.
   The anointed ministers of the altar thronged her streets, numerous as
   the flowers which bedeck the meadows in spring. There you might have
   heard the voice of sacred song every hour in the day! Within her gates
   the ritual of religion was observed with almost perpetual celebrations.
   All that was comely, sacred and holy seemed to have an exclusive abode
   within her precincts. Yet for all that, these people were not a whit
   the better. They had a baneful monopoly that they shamefully coveted--a
   monopoly of killing the Prophets and of stoning those whom God sent to
   them! The means of Grace were evidently not blessed to them.

   How plainly this shows the possibility of retaining sin, unsubdued and
   unchecked, notwithstanding all the righteousness that is taught in
   precepts, and all the Divine Grace that is exhibited in ordinances! Are
   there not regular attendants here who, though they mingle with the
   Church, join in the hymns of praise and listen to the words of
   exhortation, are as corrupt in their character and their conversation
   as if they went nowhere? Sit there not in these pews those who are as
   covetous, as bad tempered and, in some cases, as licentious as if they
   never entered a place worship at all? For them our most earnest
   rebukes, invitations and warnings are ineffective as the roaring of the
   wild waves of the sea, or the ringing of bells in a church tower--they
   produce no sort of moral or spiritual result! I speak solemnly of
   individuals, not censoriously of systems, when I affirm, without
   particularizing any denomination, because the same is true among
   ourselves! I know there are thousands who go to church and believe
   because they have conformed, more or less, to religious customs and
   observed the sacraments, all seems well with them--but neither Doctrine
   nor discipline of Christians exert the slightest influence upon their
   hearts or their lives! Their temper is as fiery or as morose. Their
   greed for the world just as inordinate. Their vanity and fondness of
   display quite as unseemly and the petty vices of a degraded mind as
   freely indulged as if they ranked themselves among the profane! They
   have all the outward signs of religion, but they have not a particle of
   vital godliness!

   I remember a time when people wore rings round their fingers to cure
   their bones of rheumatism. It may have done them some good, though I
   doubt it! But that outward forms of religion can be of any use to purge
   the heart, or sanctify the soul, I utterly disbelieve! What does it
   matter whether you go to church or not? Whether you use a prayer book
   or a hymnal or not, or whether you bend your knee morning and evening
   or not, if these things have no effect upon you--if you walk after the
   flesh and not after the Spirit? You may as well leave off these
   religious fashions, though it may seem rather bold to say so. I would
   rather you put off every sham because then you would know where and
   what you are! Religious pretence only deceives others and fools
   yourselves. We always talk about England as a Christian country. We are
   wrong! It is not a Christian, it is a heathen country! There are some
   Christians in it, thank God! But the country is not a Christian
   country. The Metropolis is not Christian. London, herself, is a heathen
   city. Vice and violence, lewdness and licentiousness are as ripe in her
   as they are in Paris or Vienna, Calcutta or Bombay! You need not go far
   afield--take the nearest court, or the blind alley that leads out of
   the main street, or go into some of the great houses at the West End
   and you will see in them such awful abominations as might convince you
   that their frequenters say, in their heart, there is no God, or, if
   they worshipped a deity, it was Buddha or Vishnu! Count the churches,
   count the chapels, take account of the mission stations--sum up all the
   outward privileges and mark the condition! In the teeth of them all, we
   may say sin is growing more rampant! The more religion, the more sin,
   if it is a religion of outward rites without the power of godliness!
   Jerusalem was the worst of cities and yet the most religious. It was
   the most profane because it was the most sanctimonious--its piety being
   a mere empty profession. In no other city was there so much
   lip-service, cringing and bowing. In offering oblations and burning
   incense, she was pre-eminent! Still, no other city had such a
   reputation for stoning the Prophets!

   And it may be that your real character may be as little in keeping with
   your pretensions. You may have prayers every morning and Bible readings
   every day. You may resort to sacraments, practice genuflections,
   observe festivals and make pilgrimages--all to no purpose! Your seeming
   sanctity may be only a mask, covering up folly and vice. The balance is
   on the wrong side. Your creed has aggravated your crimes! Your religion
   has precipitated your ruin. The tag-raggery of vestments and ceremonies
   are but the histrionics of religion in which amateurs delight! All
   their mystery and pomp are mere stage play. No benefit whatever can you
   derive from such principles or such performances. All the trust you put
   in them must entail miserable disappointments--it may involve you in
   desperate consequences! No lies can be harmless!

   Self-deception must be deadly! Lend me your eyes and I will show you
   the worst man in Jerusalem. What? Do you think that I am going to point
   out that tax-gatherer? By no means! He is a scoundrel, I admit. He
   exacted three times as much as he ought of that poor widow, and drained
   her resources. No doubt he is a real bad fellow, but I know a worse. Go
   knock at the door of yon affluent rabbi--you cannot be admitted just
   yet. Ask the servant where his master is. He will tell you that he is
   at prayers. He will not be at liberty for three-quarters of an hour at
   least. You must wait, I suppose, until this gentleman has finished his
   devotions. After a while he condescends to put in an appearance. You
   look at him with surprise. Whatever is that remarkable feature on his
   forehead? You might fancy he must have fallen down and bruised himself,
   and put a piece of plaster on his forehead. Oh, no--that little box on
   his forehead is inscribed with texts of Scripture! A Bible precept
   supplies him with a bold pretext--"You shall bind them for a frontal
   between your eyes." So, like a fool, taking the sound and leaving the
   sense, he has inserted a series of texts into a box and tied it on to
   his head! And, oh, what a deep fringe he has to his robe! It is half as
   long as his robe. What is that for? Because he is told to have a border
   to his garment and so he has it broad--half an inch would have done,
   but he has it seven inches at least! He cannot do anything in
   moderation as it should be done. He must carry everything to an
   extreme. If you wish to speak to this gentleman, you find he really
   cannot attend to you because he is just going up to the Temple--he has
   a little account to pay there. He shows it to you. Of course, he says
   he likes to show it. You can see how precise he is. It is a farthing--
   and an eighth part of it is for mint he has been using. He is very
   careful about tiny matters. Before he goes to pay that, he tells the
   servant to mind and strain out all the gnats, lest he should swallow
   any unclean animal when he drinks his wine. Follow him up to the Temple
   and you will observe him standing by himself. He is saying, "God, I
   thank You that I am not as other men are." It is rude, perhaps, to pry
   into his private doings, but as he is gone out, just let us take a look
   into this little sanctum and see his accounts. We begin to look at them
   and we must be quick, for fear he should come and catch us. Look at
   this entry, "Half a dozen widows' houses devoured last week." Go on and
   you will see all sorts of bad things that he has been doing. He would
   not have been such an atrocious villain had it not been for his
   religion! He wraps that about him as a cloak and it prevents his seeing
   what a great sinner he is. Perhaps if he did not practice so much
   piety, he might be shocked at his lack of morality. As Jesus said to
   the Pharisees, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you
   say you see--therefore, your sin remains."

   This man pretends to be a saint, but he proves to be a devil! His
   soaring profession aggravates his heartless infamy. Surely, I think,
   this example falls fairly within the scope of my text. Jerusalem, as a
   locality, the center of devoutness, became the cesspool of corruption!
   If you have the cherubim without the Shekinah. If you have the sacred
   symbols without the sanctifying Spirit. If you have the sound creed
   without the lively faith. If you have Gospel in the pulpit without
   Grace in the heart. If you have Protestant Christianity without a
   precious Christ, then the decadence of your religion will lead to the
   demoralizing of your character! The mere possession of the outward
   means of Grace may have no better effect than that of making men worse.
   Yet it entails a very solemn responsibility. No man can sin after he
   has received the Light of God from above, so cheaply as he does who
   commits his transgressions in the dark. When you are warned, and
   entreated, and begged to turn from the error of your ways--should you
   still pursue them, "Being often warned, and hardening your neck," the
   sentence is, "you shall be suddenly destroyed, and that without
   remedy." I believe some hyper-Calvinists raise an objection to the
   responsibility of man while hearing the Gospel. And there are several
   other things to which they likewise object, but I hope we shall always
   accept the testimony of God's Word without distorting it, whether it is
   agreeable or distasteful to us. As for me, I have braved the sneer of
   men because I feared the frown of my Lord. But now they are dead that
   troubled me and it is not likely that I shall cease to speak of
   unbelief as other than a grievous sin, a capital crime and an
   aggravation of all other transgressions! The Gospel is either a savor
   of life unto life, or of death unto death to everyone of you who hears
   it. If it is not a stone of help, it will become a stone of stumbling.
   You will either fall upon it and be broken, or it will fall upon you
   and grind you to powder! Beware, you that hear the Gospel and trifle
   with it, lest it be said unto you, "Behold, you despisers, and wonder,
   and perish."

   I believe that throughout eternity the punishment of the guilty will be
   aggravated forever by the privileges against which they have persisted
   in sinning. To sink into perdition from the shadow of the Gospel is
   possible. To go down with warnings of judgment and wooing of mercy
   sounding in one's ears is suicidal! To leap into the Pit headfirst and
   to find out the deepest depths of dire despair is dreadful beyond
   description! To think of it conjures up thoughts from which we recoil.
   Oh, call it not a fatal mistake, for it is a foul crime! The heathen,
   who never heard of Christ, cannot accuse them-

   selves of having wasted Sabbaths and rejected a Savior. But Sabbath
   after Sabbath you who have had the Gospel delivered in your
   hearing--you will have to bear a reproach like this, "You knew the
   Gospel, but loved it not!" This shall be the perpetual worm that shall
   never die. There was a time when God called. He himself said it, "I
   called, but you refused; I stretched out My hand, and no man regarded
   it; therefore, I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when
   your fear comes." In like manner Jesus says, "Woe unto you, Chorazin;
   woe unto you, Bethsaida; it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and
   Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for you." The privilege in each
   instance clenches the responsibility. Oh, may this solemn Truth of God
   abide with each of us!

   Now let me, in closing, give a slightly different tone to our
   meditation. We have seen that Jerusalem had a monopoly of one sin--she
   killed the Prophets.

   III. THERE ARE SINS WHICH GOD'S PEOPLE, HIS REAL PEOPLE, TRUE AND
   GENUINE SAINTS, MAY BE CHARGED WITH--no, of which they may accuse
   themselves, as exclusively their own! Possibly the very mention of them
   may lead us to repent and bring us back, again, humbly and penitently
   to the foot of the Cross that we may accept with the more gratitude the
   full Atonement which our Savior made. You and I are, dear Friends, the
   children of God in a sense in which other men are not--we are part of
   His great family. Being regenerated and adopted, we have received the
   nature of children and been put into their status. Other men are but
   subjects under His Law--we are sons and daughters. No servant can sin
   as a child can. A servant and a son may both be guilty of the same
   offense, but there is a difference in the degree of guilt, because of
   the relationship. A father may well say, "My servant ought not to have
   done this--he has offended me. But as for you, my own child, my
   beloved, you have grieved me to my heart, for you have sinned against a
   father's love as well as against a father's authority. You are bound to
   me by ties so close that you ought to have been more scrupulous. I can
   understand a servant injuring my property or my reputation, but to my
   child, both of these should be very dear." There seems to me to be a
   baseness about the ingratitude of a child with which the unkindness of
   a friend will not compare. Sharper than an adder's tooth is the conduct
   of a thankless child, because he is a child. I do not think it is
   possible for anyone not related to break and wound a mother's heart as
   her own child can. You Christians can easily apply this reflection to
   yourselves. There is a peculiar wickedness about your sin. In the
   judgment of others it is the same, but in your own judgment, if you
   think of your heavenly Father and your nearness to Him, it will seem to
   be far worse. Dear Friend, remember you are not only a child, but
   sometimes you rejoice to think that you are Christ's spouse! Now, one's
   spouse lies very near one's heart. Another person may say something
   against me, and I might pass it over. A remark which, coming from a
   stranger, or even from a friend, we might slight, but did it come from
   one's own spouse, it would cut deep into the very soul! You would say,
   "It was not an enemy. Then I could have borne it. But it was you-- you
   who rests in my bosom and enjoys my perfect confidence--you have lifted
   up your heel against me." Say, then, child of God, do you not see that
   your sins may have a peculiar heinousness about them? Them may be a
   stoning of Prophets, and a crucifying of Christ in your misdeeds!
   Although still favored as a bride, never to be divorced, your crime is
   bitter and to be repented of bitterly.

   There is one sin which has often oppressed my heart, and I dare say it
   has yours. We grow cold in love to our Savior. Some of you do not love
   your Savior with the same warmth and devotedness you did at first.
   There may be those among you who plead not guilty. I wish most of you
   could, but, alas, how many of you have to look back upon former days
   and say, "O that it were with me as in the days that are past!" More
   cause you have for loving Him--more coals have been put on the fire,
   but yet it is less hot and burns less brightly! More stones have been
   thrown on the marker and yet it is smaller than it was at first! Oh,
   strange it is--we sometimes even almost wonder to see it--that some who
   since they first came to Christ and rested only on Him, have had many
   gifts and Graces vouchsafed to them--have almost put them in the place
   of Him who gave them! Master Brookes says, "Suppose a loving husband
   were to hang his wife's ears with earrings, and put jewels about her
   neck, and rings upon her fingers--and she got so fond of all these
   pretty things that she forgot her husband? It would be a sad thing if
   love tokens should make us forget the hand that gave them." This case
   is just like ours--we begin looking at our own good works and Graces
   and get to be so pleased that we forget from whom they came--and look
   upon them as our own! Whereas there is no luster in them except that
   which is reflected--and we shall soon lose even the reflection if we
   get contented with them. We must look to Christ, and Him alone! Shame
   on us Christians that we should be thus remiss and negligent of our
   deepest, most tender obligations! This is a vice to which even the
   heathen are not prone.

   Do you ever hear of a nation forsaking its gods? Well might the Prophet
   expostulate, since no other nation forsook its gods, yet Israel forsook
   hers! Worldly men do not forsake their pursuits with the indifference
   that you forsake yours. They grow more and more enamored of the
   flaunting charms of that woman Jezebel, the world, while our hearts,
   alas, are often forgetful of our fair, infinitely fair, Lord Jesus, and
   go rambling abroad with some other love! This is a sin which none but
   Christians commit! And what shall I say of the doubts we cast upon the
   faithfulness of God, after having proved it so conspicuously? No
   unconverted person can have proved it as we have done. There are
   promises of which anyone, especially the stranger within our gates,
   might have availed himself. The world, however, discredits sheer worth.
   But some of you have gone to the Throne of Grace with pleas based on
   promises not once only--perhaps if I should say you have gone hundreds
   and thousands of times, I should not exceed the number of proofs you
   have made of the Divine faithfulness! Fifty years have transpired since
   some of you came to the Lord, and you never found Him slack. He never
   dishonored His own Word--He has been faithful and true in the midst of
   all that was fleeting and transient. Yet your heart flutters and your
   lips murmur when a fresh trial arises. How can you be so distrustful,
   so provoking? Airy says, "If there is a God, if prayer can prevail, if
   there is any kind of piety that is not a baseless presumption--all
   these are moot questions with the men of this generation." But you know
   there is a God! You know He hears prayer! You know He honors obedience
   and fulfils every tittle He has spoken! Why should you ever harbor a
   doubt, or cherish a misgiving? Is it not monstrous? Doubt, now? What
   fresh pledge, what further guarantee can you require? Do strive
   earnestly. Do pray constantly that this accursed unbelief may be cast
   out of you! Are you not heirs of Heaven? Are you not looking for and
   waiting for the coming of the Son of God? Shall your faith be steadfast
   as to the goal, and yet in suspense as to the journey?

   With such seed thoughts have I ruminated on my text, "It cannot be that
   a Prophet should perish out of Jerusalem." Jerusalem! Your name
   suggests to me all that is beautiful for situation, and all that is
   precious for privileges--and yet I tremble at your history, for it is a
   record of mischief and misery! O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Rather had I
   sung your praise than rehearsed your crimes! But, O God, let the words
   of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be alike acceptable to You!
   May such warnings be as fruitful as any wooing in drawing reluctant
   hearts to right allegiance. This is my last word--Believe and live!
   Amen.

A Searching Test

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 20, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING, JANUARY
   18, 1872.

   "Unto the pure all things are pure, but unto them who are defiled and
   unbelieving, nothing is pure, but even their mind and conscience are
   defiled." Titus 1:15.

   I SHALL not profess, this evening, to enter into a full exposition of
   this text, for there are many deep things in it, and many intricate
   questions are suggested by it. I shall only make some observations upon
   it intended to be of practical service.

   This text has often been misused--made to mean what was never in the
   Apostle's mind. He does not mean that a wrong thing becomes right to a
   pure-minded man--that is the very opposite of what he does mean! He
   means that when men's minds are pure, other matters become pure to
   them, but when their minds are impure, then they use these things for
   impurity. We shall endeavor to pick out the meaning as we go along, but
   by no means does it mean that I may pretend that I am of a pure mind
   and that, therefore, will make impurity, itself, pure! That would be to
   prove, if I found any pleasure in impurity, that my mind was impure.
   The true solution of the conduct of a man who professes to be pure in
   mind and yet commits himself to an unholy course of life, is not that
   the man makes that unholy life, pure, but that his unholy living proves
   that his mind is not pure at all!

   Our text has in it, tonight, two kinds of men--the pure and the defiled
   and unbelieving. And secondly, it has two kinds of effects produced
   upon these men by outward things--to the one, all things are pure--to
   the other, there is nothing pure. First, let us talk about these--

   I. TWO KINDS OF MEN.

   First, the pure--where shall we find them? Where are they born? We
   answer, no men are born so! Who shall bring a clean thing out of an
   unclean? No one! Not one! As our parents have sinned, we, their
   children, are born with tendencies to sin--we are impure even from
   birth! There are none pure but those who are made so by a second
   creation! The first time they are marred upon the wheel. They must go
   under the Creator's hand a second time--they must feel the power of the
   purifying Spirit of God creating them anew before they can be called
   pure at all! And these are not absolutely pure. Even in those who are
   entitled to be called, "pure in heart," there remains impurity. If any
   man shall question that, let him remember the First Epistle of John,
   the first Chapter, at the 8th verse--"If any man says he has no sin, he
   is a liar, and the truth is not in him." There is sin in the best of
   men--and if they do not perceive it, it must be because they are
   blinded with a foolish self-conceit--for in the purest heart there
   still remains connected with it the old nature and the impurity
   inherited from the first Adam. This makes life a perpetual conflict
   until life's close. Still, we name men by their predominant
   characteristics. The partial impurity of a good man does not entitle
   him to be called impure. If the master principle within him, the
   reigning principle, is purity, he is a pure man. A man may once in his
   life have spoken an untruth--he may have been surprised into saying a
   thing which is not--but if the general tenor of his life is stern
   integrity, we do not, therefore, condemn him and brand him as a liar!
   Otherwise where were the men living upon earth who would be worthy of a
   name implying praise? The godly are pure--have been made pure by
   regeneration, and they are pure, though not absolutely so.

   They are pure in their affections. They love not that which is
   unchaste, unhallowed, untruthful, unlawful before God. Their soul loves
   that which God approves. They seek after that which God, Himself,
   commands. If they do not always keep God's statutes, yet they love
   them. And if they do not always walk in His ways without slipping, yet
   they love

   His ways and desire to walk in them without a single turning aside to
   the right hand or to the left! The set of the current of their soul is
   towards purity. They mourn over those currents and eddies into which
   they are turned by temptation. They are the last men to excuse
   them--the rush and current of their soul, their deepest and truest
   life--is that they may be cleansed from all false ways and from sin.
   And as they are pure in their affections, they become pure in their
   actions. They, if they are, indeed, the people of God, cannot run with
   the multitude to do evil. The swine may find its pleasure in the mire,
   but God's sheep love clean pastures. The raven may feed upon its
   garbage and be at home, there, but not so the dove--it likes the clean
   garner and the clean roosting place. The child of God shuns not only
   the darker sins which defile so many, but even those which others think
   but a trifle. And what some would permit and rejoice in, the Christian
   mourns, abhors, laments and avoids. The actions of the Christian--I do
   not claim perfection for them, but I do claim that the true Christian
   strives after perfection in his actions, that he seeks after it, yes,
   and that, as a rule, he comes nearer to it than his enemies would
   allow, or than even his own reflections, when he is examining himself,
   would permit him to believe! God has a people who still walk uprightly
   in the world. There are still some that are as pillars in the House of
   God upon whom he has written the name of our God--some who have not
   defiled their garments--who shall walk with Him in white, for, by His
   Grace, they are made worthy.

   And these men being thus pure in their affections and in their actions
   are most of all pure in their desires. Their greatest desire is towards
   purity. I am sure I speak the language of every renewed heart when I
   say that if the Lord were to appear by night to you, and say to you, as
   He did to Solomon, "What shall I give you?" there is no renewed heart
   here that would say, "Lord, give me riches!" There is no one that would
   say, "Give me health!" We may desire both of these things in a
   secondary degree, but our main desire would be this, "Lord, give me
   that holy character which would please You and bring honor to the
   religion I profess." Holiness, holiness, holiness--it is a thing which
   every renewed heart longs after beyond everything else! I would have
   perfect orthodoxy in my head if I could, but I know even if I had that,
   an unhallowed life would render it of little service to me. But could I
   have a clean heart, other things would come with it and from it, for
   the pure in heart shall see God! And if they see God, what else is
   there that they shall notsee, for the eyes which have glanced on God,
   Himself, will be able to perceive the difference between truth and
   error, and will not be liable to be deceived! The Christian is pure in
   his desires. Now if it is so, that in his affections within, and his
   actions without, and in the desires of his entire nature, he would be
   pure, he is entitled to this name and God has given it to him!

   But there are some, on the other hand, who are defied and unbelieving.
   These two things appear to go together. Now it was denied some time
   since, that every unbeliever is unclean in his life, and I think there
   is some ground in the denial. I should not like to stand here and say
   that I believe every infidel, every rejecter of the religion of Christ
   is a man unfit for the social circle and a sinner against the laws of
   decency! I do not believe it. Honestly, I must say that there are some
   men who have rejected the Gospel--I grieve that they have--have denied
   God and yet somehow they have been a vast deal better than their creed,
   and they have managed to walk in a consistency of moral conduct towards
   man which has almost been worthy to be set up as an example to
   Christians! I believe such cases are not the rule, and that candor,
   when it has made the admission which I have made, is compelled to add
   that this is an extraordinary thing and cannot have been produced by
   the creed, for the creed, itself, of the godless is necessarily
   logically and properly the creed of the unbelieving, producing sin! Why
   should they obey a Law of God if they do not believe in a Law-Giver, or
   if they only believe in a law-giver who will not punish and who cannot
   reward? When men have denied God, they have surely given up the
   sanction which should lead them to anything like purity--and if they
   live as most of them do live--it cannot be said that they are
   inconsistent with their creed.

   Yet, indeed, as a rule, and as a rule without exception--having said
   what I have said (and I do not contradict myself)--as a rule without an
   exception, the unbelieving heart is a defiled heart for all that. For
   what did we admit? That the man who rejects his God is not, therefore,
   a thief? Has he not robbed God? What did we say? That the man who
   rejects Christ is not, therefore, licentious? Is that purity which
   rejects perfection? Is that heart pure that cannot see loveliness in
   the Character and the Person of the Redeemer? What did we admit? That
   the unbeliever is not seditious? Yet is he a loyal subject of God who
   denies the Godhead, who rails against God, and who lives from day to
   day as if there were no God at all? Men, if they were called sinners,
   would not shudder at the word--they admit it! But call them criminals
   and at once they are angry and defend themselves--the reason being, I
   suppose, that with the mass of mankind it seems a trifle to offend God,
   but a very serious thing to have offended man! And here is the whole
   stress of the matter--the de-

   filement of the unbeliever lies always God-ward, even when it is not
   apparent man-ward. And when the unbeliever, somehow or other, keeps his
   garments clean as before his fellow men, yet as before his God what is
   he? He is one who has cast off all obligations to his Maker, who denies
   all responsibilities to his King, who receives bounties from Jehovah's
   hands but is not grateful and will not even acknowledge that the
   mercies come from those hands at all! He lives in habitual contempt of
   the Adorable--destitute of all admiration for the infinitely
   Glorious--who does what angels must shudder to think of--lives without
   love to Christ, without trust in the promises of God! There is a
   defilement, there, which, I venture to say, is even greater if looked
   at in a right light, than any form of defilement which becomes
   perceptible by men as between themselves!

   But notice in this text that it seems to correct a good deal of the
   mental philosophy we have heard of. For instance, I have heard it
   asserted that conscience is God's vice regent among men. I have often
   heard expressions from the pulpit and read them in books which led me
   to infer that every fallen man has got not only something good in him,
   but some strong principle almost akin to the Divine! I believe in the
   fall of man and I believe that to be total--and that conscience is a
   power which has fallen with all the rest, and that there does not exist
   in the world a pure conscience--except so far as God has purified it by
   the work of His Spirit. Conscience, itself, is a defiled thing! And so
   far from being a representative of God, I could not think for a moment
   of comparing it with that Ever-Blessed and Pure Being! The fact is that
   conscience, although it must be to man practically his guide, is not
   ever a safe one, for the true guide of every man is the Bible, the
   revealed will of God. That is true, pure and right, but my conscience
   may often be a dark conscience, an ignorant conscience, a perverted
   conscience--and so my business is not to follow my conscience as I find
   it, but to go to God and ask Him to enlighten my conscience and guide
   it! Neither is it an excuse for a man for doing wrong when he says he
   was conscientious in doing it. It is an excuse as far as men are
   concerned, but not before God! God's Law is not of variable quantity or
   quality depending upon the quantity or quality of the conscience--it is
   fixed and definite! Just as if a man were to take prussic acid,
   believing that it would benefit him--he would die, despite his
   conscience--or as if a person were to walk northward, expecting to
   reach his home in the south! He would not do anything of the kind! Or
   as if a man were to go to sea in a leaky vessel and a storm came
   on--his conscience would not save him--so it is with you! If you are
   astray, you are astray. Your business was to have waited upon God to
   have had that conscience corrected! Your business was to have laid that
   conscience at the foot of the Cross and ask the Master to purify it--to
   have waited upon the Holy Spirit for His teaching and consulted the
   Infallible Oracles of God's Book to know what was the will of the Most
   High! It is not, therefore, for every man to be crying up his
   conscience. I believe in the conscience, by all means, among men, but
   there is none perfect before God! Their conscience should be bowed to
   God's Law, to God's Gospel, to believe His teachings and to obey His
   precepts. Conscience, no more than any other power, is irresponsible!
   It is under law in Him. He created man and put the conscience within
   him, which conscience has been spoiled and injured by the Fall.

   Now there are men in the world with defiled understandings and defiled
   consciences. They cannot judge rightly. Their understanding is defiled.
   They put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. "A man cannot do
   that," says one. He does do it. There are thousands in this world who
   deliberately judge amiss, and who, when they sit down, even to think of
   a question (which, alas, we cannot often bring them to do), naturally
   come to a wrong conclusion because the scales which they weigh are out
   of gear. The measure which they use is not the measure of the
   sanctuary! Their understanding is defiled. And even when they bring
   their moral sense to bear upon some question, they are inevitably
   mistaken because their conscience, itself has become defiled also. A
   sad state for men to be in, but into this state each man, according to
   his degree, is brought until his will turns to God and is rectified by
   the great Spirit. We are all impure--impure in every part. "The whole
   head is sick, and the whole heart is faint." We are all fallen. In
   manhood's vast temple there stands not a solitary pillar that is quite
   erect. Here and there, there are masses that seem as though they stood
   as once they were, to let us know how grand a thing human nature might
   have been--but there is enough upon the whole to let us see that it is
   all in ruin, and in such ruin that unless He who built it at the first
   shall put forth His Omnipotent Power and use again the old fiat which
   created the world, it will still be a ruin and desolation--a den of all
   manner of unclean things!

   Thus have I spoken upon the two sorts of men, the pure and the defiled.
   But now, secondly, here is the main point that we have to speak of--

   II. THE TWO AFFECTS PRODUCED ON THESE TWO KINDS OF MEN.

   To those who are pure, all things are pure. To those who are impure and
   unbelieving, everything becomes impure. Only a few things by way of
   specimen.

   First, let us think of the attributes of God. To the Believer in
   Christ, whose heart is pure, how glorious is God! And every time we
   think of Him, adore Him and have fellowship with Him, we grow purer for
   it. The true Believer cannot think of God and draw nearer to Him
   without becoming more like his God. But look at the unbeliever.
   Oft-times his very thoughts of God have been, themselves, defiled by
   the defilement of his understanding, irritating him, filling him with
   wrath and abhorrence. He does not delight in the holiness of God--he
   says it is severity. "How can a man be happy with such laws to bind
   him?" He does not delight in the wisdom of God in Providence--he thinks
   things are ordered very much amiss, seeing they do not all conduce to
   his pleasure in the ways of sin! And, especially, if you set before him
   God's mercy, that most blessed of all attributes which, to the
   Believer, is purifying to the highest degree, you will find the
   unbeliever saying, "God is Merciful," and making that an excuse for his
   continuing in sin! How sad it is that when we preach the Gospel and
   give the invitations of Infinite Mercy, there are many who will say,
   "Ah, then, I can turn to God just when I like, and He is very gracious,
   and He will forgive me! Therefore I will continue in my rebellion
   against Him." And when we have been pathetic, and our soul has poured
   over from our eyes as we have spoken of those saved at the eleventh
   hour, while there have been some minds that have been led to Christ,
   thereby, there are some who have drawn the horrible inference that
   they, too, might wait until the eleventh hour and venture their eternal
   interests upon the mercy of God at the last! Brothers, I believe you
   cannot preach of God without some men making mischief of it, even of
   just so simple a Truth as His Mercy. But when you come to His
   Sovereignty--a deep that can never be fathomed--how many have been
   drowned in it! I believe we ought to speak about it. I am not of those
   who say we should be silent upon it, but how many have been drowned in
   those deeps, willfully, because they have said, "Who has resisted His
   will? Why does He find fault? If it is to be, it is to be. If it will
   be, it will be." They have even dared to make God the Author of their
   sin and drawn an apology for their unrighteousness from the thrice holy
   King of Kings! To the pure in heart, all things are so pure that we,
   ourselves, sink into nothing in humility and penitence before Him! But
   to the ungodly, even God, Himself, becomes an argument for continuance
   in sin!

   Now take another. It is so with God, but it is equally is so with the
   Gospel The Doctrines of the Gospel are, to the Believer, very pure.
   There is not one of them but what has a practical effect upon his life.
   I take the Doctrine of Election. Then if He has chosen us, He has
   chosen us to be a peculiar people zealous of good works, and special
   love we feel binds us to special service. We often sing--

   "Loved of my God, for Him again With love intense I burn! Chosen of Him
   before time began, We choose Him in return!"

   So with the Doctrine of Redemption that He has redeemed us by His
   precious blood. The inference from it is, "You are not your own, you
   are bought with a price--therefore, glorify God in your bodies and in
   your spirits, which are His." Take the sweet Doctrine of Final
   Perseverance, "The righteous shall hold on his way." Now the godly man
   feels that he must so live as to prove that he is a godly man by
   persevering, and he looks for daily Grace to hold him on and to keep
   him to the end. He blesses that Infinite Affection that does not turn
   aside from him and he feels drawn to it by constant watchfulness. I
   might mention all the Doctrines, but every Christian will admit at once
   that he that has this hope in him purifies himself. But take the effect
   of these Truths of God upon the unbelieving and the impure. Why, you
   know how they will pervert Divine Election! How often men have made
   that a coverlet for the grossest licentiousness! As for the redeeming
   blood, alas, how many have made the Cross, which is the Tree of Life,
   to be the tree of death to them! It has become a savor of death unto
   death to them. We have known some whose damnation is just--who have
   said, "We are the children of God, and we will live as we like," and
   they have, therefore, given themselves over to uncleanness. Surely of
   all blasphemers, they must bear the palm--they stand among the worst.
   But when men thus turn the Gospel into licentiousness, are we to say it
   is the Gospel's fault? Are we to keep back some of these Doctrines? By
   no means, for, "unto the pure all things are pure." Unto the unclean
   and unbelieving, these holy things will always be impure. You might as
   well forbid the sun to shine because when its beams fall upon a
   dunghill, it brings forth unwholesome odors! Yes, but that same sun,
   when it falls upon the flowers, makes them shed their aromatic perfume
   on every hand! It is doing incalculable good.

   It is not the sun, but the dunghill that must be blamed. And when the
   Truth of God is perverted, you must not blame the Truth, but blame the
   unclean, unbelieving heart that turns it into sin!

   Now the same thing is true of the ordinances of the Gospel, and
   dreadfully true, here, too! When you come to the ordinances of the
   Gospel, such, for instance, as the preaching of the Word--the true
   Believer, every time he hears the Word is purged by the Word. "Now you
   are clean, you are purged through the Word which I have spoken to you."
   The Truth of God shows him his own sinfulness. He sees his face in a
   mirror and endeavors to remove the spots which the Word of God reveals
   to him. But an ungodly man hearing the Word of God, grows the worse,
   perhaps, not only openly, but in his heart! Oh, there are some that sit
   in this very place--have done so for years! I thank God they are
   getting to be very, very few, now. I hope there will be none such,
   soon. May Grace grant there may not be one! But you will notice that
   the very Truth of God which once made them tremble, does not now--and
   whereas some years ago the preaching of the Gospel often brought tears
   to their eyes and sent them on their knees, it does not now--and sins
   which they were gladly to give up at one time, and which pricked their
   conscience, are now indulged in without compunction, for the same
   Gospel which softens, hardens, as the sun, which shines on wax and
   melts it, shines on clay and hardens it! Even the blessed ordinance of
   preaching--the hearing of the Word--may make some men to become yet
   more and more unclean. Alas, that it should be so. But see how Baptism
   and the Lord's Supper, both of them (for I cannot now stay long to
   discriminate), have been misused. Whereas these are, both of them,
   ordinances to lead men to remember precious Truths of God--the death
   and burial of the Lord in the one case, and the soul's feeding in the
   other case, on the precious body and blood of Jesus, and rejoicing in
   Him as blessed spiritual meat, how is it that we have been told (and it
   is preached from thousands of pulpits in England) that Baptism washes
   away sin and absolutely regenerates the soul? And though I have been
   chided for putting too strong a sense upon the word, "regenerate," I
   have lived to see a stronger sense put upon it by some than I put upon
   it until it has become with some, simply a superstitious ordinance, and
   nothing more, full of mischief. And as to the Lord's Supper, they tell
   us that there is in it a power to forgive all sin, even the most
   heinous. And this is not spoken now and then, accidentally--a slip of
   tongue--but is printed and scattered all over England as a true
   Doctrine of God!

   Well, these men's minds are impure and, therefore, even those two
   precious ordinances are turned into superstition and into impurity--and
   I suppose it always will be so. But if the mind becomes pure, and
   becomes believing in Christ, it will never exalt mere bread and wine
   into the place of Deity, and water into the place of the Divine Spirit,
   Himself. God save us from having our minds rendered so impure as to
   fall into superstition by simple ordinances which are full of
   instruction! I do not doubt that there are many who are now depending
   for eternal life upon having gone to the "Sacrament of the Mass," and
   are expecting to enter Heaven because they have reposed their
   confidence in a man who was arrogant enough to call himself the
   exclusive priest of God! God save us from having our understanding
   defiled, for it must be before it can submit to the belief of such
   superstition as this!

   But I must pass on. I have often noticed how the Church of God, itself
   becomes to pure minds one thing, and to impure minds another. You shall
   find a man a member of a Christian Church who will tell you that
   wherever he has gone in that Church he has met with Brothers and
   Sisters full of love, full of earnestness--and he has been delighted to
   associate with them. I have been at the bedside of a venerable Brother
   recently, whom nearly all of you know, and if you were to hear his
   opinion of the Church of which he is a member, he would speak of it in
   the most glowing terms. The reason is that he sees in his fellow
   Christians very much what there is in himself. The man who is loving
   comes to love the Brethren! The man who is chaste, pure and zealous,
   attributes to others a like spirit and believes they are pure, and they
   are to him so assuredly. But you shall meet with another, a carnal,
   worldly-minded professor, and he says, "Oh, there's no love!" He has
   not any. "There's no zeal" he says. There certainly would not be if all
   were like he! "Ah," he says, "I don't see any of the Apostolic living
   that I read of in the Scriptures." There is no Apostolic living in his
   own case! He didn't see it because he hasn't got it! To use an old
   illustration--if you send a buzzard flying over a tract of country,
   what will it see? Why, it will be looking out for all the dead
   carcasses and it will be sure to be able to tell you how much carrion
   there is about! But if you send a dove over that same space, it won't
   have an eye for it, for it has no taste for it--but it will tell you of
   everything that is fair and beautiful, like itself! So is it with the
   pure mind in the midst of God's people--it sees purity! It cannot shut
   its eyes to impurity, but it rejoices in the Truth and speaks of it,
   and speaks it as well as it can at all times with a charity that thinks
   no evil. But with the impure and the unbelieving, every place is
   defiled--and the man tars everything with the filth that is in his own
   bucket!

   Now the events of Providence--I will not detain you much longer, but
   let me observe that all the events of Providence are, to some men, one
   thing, and to some men another! Is a man with a pure mind suddenly
   lifted up in the world in wealth? He uses that for the poor of the
   Church of Christ. If he is impure, then that wealth allows him to
   gratify his impure taste and he sinks deeper in impurity! Does a pure
   man come to poverty? Then his poverty drives him nearer to God and he
   seeks to make himself useful among the poorer Brethren where he dwells.
   But if he is impure, he assumes the most groveling tastes and becomes
   the more wicked! Is a man a Christian? Then health is a delight to
   him--to consecrate it all to his Lord. Has a sinner health--then that
   health shall enable him to go farther into sin, or, at any rate, to
   indulge himself the more, for he will not consecrate it to his God.
   Anything that happens may be used two ways--and the pure shall see in
   every event something which he can turn to God's Glory! And the impure
   can see in everything a means by which he may indulge himself.

   Now it is so if you mingle with the sons of men and see their sins. We
   are grieved at them. But when the Christian sees sin, he thinks, "This
   is what I would be but for the Grace of God." So he praises God for His
   Grace. "This is what I shall be," he says, "if I am not watchful." So
   he becomes the more watchful and out of the very sin of his fellow men,
   he extracts some reasons for greater holiness and grows more pure
   because he observes the loathsomeness of impurity and turns from it the
   more earnestly. But the ungodly man is carried away by the evil
   example--his conscience is more deadened by it--and he becomes bolder
   in sin in consequence of what he sees in others! I am sure you will
   have observed it so, that where the good man gathers grapes, another
   finds nothing but poisoned apples--and where the Christian turns over
   this man's depravity and finds in it a reason for greater holiness in
   his own person, the ungodly man only sees more excuses for himself for
   the past--and the greater license for himself in the future! Take
   another list of things, namely, the treatment of men to us. Suppose men
   praise us? The Christian says, "I must be watchful, for the praise of
   man is often inconsistent with the favor or God." The ungodly man says,
   "Everybody praises me! What a silly fellow I must be!" There is a
   foulness of pride which comes upon him. The man who lives near to God,
   if he is sneered at by the sons of men, says, "It comes upon me for
   God's sake. By His Grace, I will bear it."But the other says he will
   not have any more of that and turns aside from a path which becomes
   rough, even though he knows that path to be right! How often has unjust
   treatment driven the ungodly man to anger, and in some cases to malice
   and to resolutions of revenge! To the impure an injustice makes him
   more impure. But see the Christian who is like his Master. Every
   injustice makes him cry for Grace to forgive--and when yet more
   injustice is heaped upon him, he forgives the more and tries to heap
   yet more coals of fire upon the head of his enemy by doing him the
   greater kindness, if by any means he may win his soul! So out of the
   worst of things the Christian extracts the best, while from the very
   best of things an unhallowed mind may extract the worst!

   Let us close--though there are many, many illustrations that might be
   given of this. Here you have, tonight, means afforded for judging
   yourselves. Do you find in God's Book that which makes you angry with
   God? Do you find in the Gospel that which makes you complaisant with
   yourself while you are unregenerate? Do you find in Providence that
   which irritates you, or which seems to excuse you in sin? Then your
   mind is impure, for these things are with you according to what you
   are. "It is dark," you say. It is your eyes that are dark--the Light of
   God is light and bright. "It is bitter," you say, when we bring you the
   honey of the Gospel. It is not the honey that is bitter--it is your
   mouth--it is your mouth that is out of order. How often ought people to
   recollect this when they hear a true Gospel sermon! George Herbert
   says, "Judge not the preacher--he is your judge." And very often when a
   man has condemned the sermon, he had far better condemn himself! He has
   not agreed with it? No, if he had, it would not have been true! When
   sometimes we have heard some man of low life railing at us, we have
   said, "Thank God! Supposing that wretch had praised us, we would have
   known there was something amiss about us! There are public papers
   which, if they praised a man, you would know at once that the man
   deserved hanging, or something near approaching to it! Their censure is
   the only homage they can give to that which is right. So when any soul
   kicks against Christ--the precious blood of Christ, the Gospel of God,
   the purity of God--do we condemn God because this man condemns Him? No,
   but God is glorified by the unrighteous nature of this man rebelling
   against Him! If God were other than He is, an unrighteous man might
   love Him, but being hated and despised, and forgotten of ungodly men,
   it does but prove that God is not such as they are, but infinitely
   superior to them! Let us judge ourselves, then, by this.

   But provided we are obliged to come to the conclusion that our minds
   are not pure, we need not end there, for there are means by which they
   may be made so! Glory be to God, if my mind and conscience are defiled,
   they need not always be so. There is cleansing. I cannot effect it for
   myself, nor can any outward forms do it--

   "No outward form can make me clean, The leprosy lies deep within"

   But God has set forth Christ to be a Savior--and He shall save His
   people from their sins--from their sinfulness, too, and whoever
   believes in Christ Jesus, that is, trusts in Him, there is already in
   him the beginning of purity! God the Holy Spirit will give him more and
   more of the likeness of Christ, for he that believes shall be saved
   from sin, from indwelling sin, from all sin, from the power as well as
   from the guilt of it! Faith will cleanse him, applying to him the
   precious blood and the water which flows from the side of Christ! Faith
   will, by the Holy Spirit's power, become a cleansing as well as a
   saving Grace! God grant it to us, and may we all be among the pure,
   unto whom all things shall be pure. We ask it for Christ's sake! Amen.

Christ a Sanctuary

   (No. 3522)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, JULY 27, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And He will be as a sanctuary." Isaiah 8:14.

   MANY of the Rabbis, and I think with good reason, refer this to the
   Messiah. We refer it to Jesus Christ, the Man of Nazareth, the Son of
   God, who is the Messiah of God to our souls. We are, no doubt,
   justified in referring it to our Lord Jesus Christ, because Peter,
   speaking by the Holy Spirit, uses the next part of the verse in
   reference to Him. He declares that it was written that Jesus should be
   a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. If, then, the latter part
   of the verse is by Divine Authority interpreted as belonging to Christ,
   we may be pretty sure that the former part of the verse requires the
   same construction!

   So then, as a subject for our present meditation, we take the fact that
   Jesus Christ will be as a sanctuary. He will be as a sanctuary in three
   respects, upon each of which we shall speak with all possible
   simplicity. First, Jesus will be as a sanctuary--

   I. IN WHICH WE, AS POOR GUILTY SINNERS, SHALL FIND A SHELTER.

   A sanctuary was a place where a criminal who dared not appear before
   the tribunals of his country found a shelter. Such sanctuaries once
   abounded in England. Certain shrines which were considered sacred had
   this privilege or this curse--I do not know which it was--accorded to
   them--that whenever a criminal had fled to them, he was beyond the arm
   of justice. There was such a sanctuary in Westminster and another not
   far from this Tabernacle, but they were ultimately abolished. Among the
   Jews the privilege of the sanctuary was kept in proper check, yet it
   was not forbidden. Certain cities were set apart to which man-slayers,
   who had accidentally slain anyone, might flee for security. We find
   also that among the Jews, some hoped to find shelter in the precincts
   of the Temple. Joab went to the altar and laid hold upon the horns, and
   thought himself secure, though when Solomon sent and bade him come
   outside, he said, "No, but I will die here," so that the altar in those
   days was nota sanctuary. It was not until later times that it was
   unjustifiable to kill men when they had entered into holy places, and
   hence holy places and sanctuaries became places of refuge.

   Our Lord Jesus Christ is a place of secure refuge for every soul that
   flies to Him. The moment a sinner believes in Jesus, he is safe--and
   continuing to believe, he remains safe in life, safe in death, safe in
   judgment, safe in eternity! The passing out of self-righteousness into
   confidence in Christ is the act that saves the soul. When your faith
   lays its hand upon the dear head of the Redeemer--what if I say upon
   the horns of the altar of His Sacrifice--then is your soul secure and
   nothing can destroy it!

   Let us explain this mystery. Why is it that believing in Jesus makes
   the soul safe? It is because when God was angry with men and must
   necessarily smite men for their sins, Jesus interposed. The blows that
   ought to have fallen upon men fell upon the Savior. The debt which was
   due from the multitude of sinners to the great God, Jesus paid--

   "He bore that man might never bear His Father's righteous ire."

   It will be manifest to you all that if Jesus Christ suffered, thus, in
   our stead, we shall not be called on to suffer the penalty He
   discharged. If Jesus paid our debts, they are cancelled and we are in
   debt no longer! If Jesus Christ became our Substitute and stood for us
   before God, then our warfare is accomplished and, henceforth, the Law
   of God can exact nothing at our hands. Do you ask for whom did Jesus
   Christ thus shed His blood as a Substitute, a Representative? We
   answer, for as many as believe on His name. "For God so loved the
   world"--now, mark, here is the gauge, this is the test! I have heard
   people dwell on that word, "so," as if it were something boundless and
   unqualified, without measure or

   limitation! But listen to the passage--"For God so loved the world"--so
   much and no more--"that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever
   believes on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." The work
   of Christ thus begins and ends with, " Whoever believes on Him." If you
   believe not, dying as you are, the death of Christ has nothing to do
   with you except to plunge you into yet deeper despair! It is only to
   the man who believes that the blood is applied! No other soul under
   Heaven has any share in the merit of that glorious Sacrifice, or shall
   be accepted thereby, but the men who believe. But for every soul that
   believes in Him, Jesus Christ has borne all the punishment that soul
   deserved to have borne. God cannot in justice punish that man, for He
   has punished Christ instead of him. For every soul that believes,
   Christ has drunk the cup of wrath to the very dregs. There is not a
   drop left in that cup for anyone who believes on Christ, for Christ has
   drained it. By Jesus the debts have all been discharged--He has not
   left one of them in the book of God's record. Every soul that believes
   is secure before the courts of Heaven because Jesus stood for him! My
   main enquiry here must be, "Do you believe in Jesus?" I will put it in
   other words. To believe is to trust. Do you trustin Jesus? Do you rely
   upon Him? If so, then Jesus stood for you!

   Now do you see how Jesus Christ becomes a Sanctuary? Just in this way.
   Because I fear God's anger for my sin, by faith I put myself beneath
   the Cross of Christ. There God's anger fell upon the innocent Victim.
   Divine Justice was clear when it allowed the Holy One to be condemned
   and put to death. But that same Justice demands a full release for
   those on whose behalf He mediated! Their faith furnishes the evidence
   of their freedom. If God has punished Christ for my sin, He will not
   also punish me for it. If Christ has paid my debt, then paid it is--nor
   will God, the Judge of all, bring the handwriting of ordinances which
   was once against me, to indict me for charges that have been fully
   satisfied! Where is common equity if the Substitute should suffer and
   then the man for whom the Substitute suffered should suffer again? Thus
   Justice, itself, puts a canopy over the head of the ransomed sinner.
   When the fiery sleet of God's wrath descends, he smiles, because he has
   found a retreat, a Sanctuary. The fury of the storm spent itself upon
   the great Substitute. He bore it all and the sinner escaped. Oh, what a
   blessed Truth of God! He who has never realized it for himself has
   never known the Gospel. I care not how high your professions, nor how
   great your boastings, nor to what church you belong--if you have not
   come to rest in the substitutionary work of Jesus Christ, you do not
   know the first letter of the Gospel alphabet! May the Lord, the Holy
   Spirit, teach you, for this is the Gospel of the Grace of God which we
   declare unto you, knowing that we shall have to answer for our
   preaching at the last assize!

   Mark, the Lord Jesus Christ in this way becomes a Sanctuary to us from
   all our deadly fears. Who among us is not sometimes disturbed with the
   recollection of his past life? Surely it has not been as it ought to
   have been with us. What black spots does our memory conjure up? How
   much of our time has run to waste? Were you called to die now--and oh,
   how soon the summons will come--every week takes some of you away! But
   in the solemn hour of death, would not your past life bring up dismal
   fears, deep regrets and dark forebodings? What, then, would you do?
   Why, what should you do but--as you have done before--fall back upon
   this great Truth that Jesus died for him that believes and, trusting in
   Him, you would say--

   "A guilty, weak, and helpless worm, On Your kind arms I fall! Be You my
   strength, my righteousness, My Savior and my All!"

   So might you lean your head back upon your pillow and feel it sweet to
   die with confidence in Christ. Thus, Beloved, from God's wrath and from
   our deadly fears, the Lord Jesus Christ becomes a Sanctuary to those
   who trust Him.

   A Sanctuary He is, likewise, from all our cares. From anxiety and
   disquietude, who among us is exempt? In the midst of trials and
   troubles, be they in mind, body, or estate--from pain, poverty, or
   pressure of any kind, is it not a blessed thing to say--

   "His way was much rougher and darker than mine Did Christ, my Lord,
   suffer, and shall I repine?"

   The remembrance of what He endured for you becomes a sanctuary from
   dejection and despair! The Friend you trust will prove true. He will
   treat you tenderly, to whatever cause you trace your hardships.

   Permit me to ask each and every one of you individually--Have you ever
   fled to this Sanctuary? Can you answer, "Yes"? Then happy are you! Go
   and tell others about it? Let not your tongue be silent. Let others
   know that there is a covert from the tempest and a shelter from the
   rough wind; and that you have found and proved it. Be not afraid to

   speak. There is more reason to fear silence than speech with such a
   safeguard from sins, snares, and sorrows! Publish it to the worst and
   vilest, if you meet with them. Let your kinsfolk and acquaintances know
   that there is a safe sanctuary in Christ and that you have tested its
   virtues and its validity. The weight of your personal testimony may be
   blessed by God's Spirit to their conversion! At any rate, your duty to
   your fellow creatures and your devotion to your heavenly Benefactor
   demand this grateful service! Or perhaps you may have never resorted to
   this Sanctuary. Then be sure that your peril is fearful and your doom
   is imminent! Out of Christ there is no hope! He that believes not on
   Him is condemned already, because he has not believed on the Son of
   God! At this present moment--and who can tell how critical the present
   moment may be--the wrath of God abides on you! It rests on you, moral
   though you may be as a citizen, virtuous though you may be as a young
   man, or pure and affectionate as a young woman, seeing you have not
   believed! The one thing necessary is lacking. No plea you can offer is
   valid. You have put yourselves out of court. The wicked shall be cast
   into Hell with all the nations that forget God! That is the category in
   which you place yourselves. You have forgotten God! You have neglected
   Christ! You have never reached a resting place!

   Oh, listen! Do you not long for an asylum, a sanctuary, a safe retreat?
   Are you anxious to reach it? You may easily find it! As you run
   eagerly, you will read clearly. If you are really humbled and brought
   to know your need of a Savior, He is easy of access. Just give up all
   your doings and cast yourselves into His arms. I have used this
   illustration before, but it will answer my purpose again. There is a
   boy in a burning house. He is clinging yonder to a windowsill. If he
   falls to the ground, he will be dashed to pieces. But a strong man
   standing underneath cries, "Boy, drop! I will catch you!" His hands let
   go and he falls safely into the arms that are stretched out to rescue
   him. That letting go is an act of faith, and he is saved thereby. Such
   faith I would have you now exercise--let go of everything you have been
   clinging to--just drop into the Savior's arms and on His sacred bosom
   you shall find rest. Depend on Him, and on Him alone. 'Tis all that is
   asked of you! Will you tell me that you are not fit? Did you ever hear
   of fitness in connection with a sanctuary? Why, the worst of thieves,
   and even murderers, were accustomed to fly to the sanctuary! So,
   however vile you may be, Christ sets the sanctuary of His Atonement
   wide open before you, that you may go to it and find shelter--

   "Let not conscience make you linger,

   Nor of fitness fondly dream.

   All the fitness He requires

   Is to feel your need of Him--

   This He gives you,

   'Tis His Spirit's rising beam." Right joyful should I be if, by the
   Holy Spirit's power, I might persuade some of you to flee to Jesus and
   depend alone upon Him. This would be the happiest day of your lives,
   the beginning of a new life! Well do I recollect when I looked to my
   Lord and Master and found salvation in Him. Never can I forget the
   happy day when Jesus took my sins away. Most affectionately and
   earnestly do I entreat you to look to Him--and so shall your eyes be
   enlightened. Depend on a Crucified Savior and you shall find peace and
   comfort to your souls. Secondly, Jesus Christ is a Sanctuary in the
   sense of--

   II. A PLACE OF WORSHIP.

   We often hear people talk, nowadays, of exclusively holy places. They
   will sometimes call some edifice, be it a parish church or a private
   chapel, a sanctuary. I take it that this is a mistaken use of the word
   if used exclusively. No one place is a bit more sacred than another!
   Those who would draw near to the Lord should remember that--

   "Wherever we seek Him, He is found, And everyplace is hallowed ground."
   It is nothing but a relic of Judaism, or a result of Roman Catholic
   superstition, to suppose that there are specially holy places
   constructed of bricks and mortar, or consecrated stones. Your bedroom,
   where you bow the knee, may be as near the gate of Heaven as the grand
   cathedral along whose vaulted roofs the music of song has resounded for
   centuries! Jesus Christ, however, is a Sanctuary! He is the Holy Place
   of His people's worship! Treasure that up. You may worship God anywhere
   if you get with Christ, but if you forget Christ, you can worship
   nowhere! "No man comes unto the Father but by Me," says Christ. You can
   never have an acceptable worship of the Most High except through Jesus
   Christ.

   I will take you for a moment into that which was called the Holy Place
   under the old Jewish law, the Holy of Holiest. What was there? Only two
   things which could be seen. The one was the golden censer, and the
   other was the Mercy Seat,

   and both of these things were instructive. Now, Beloved, when you go to
   the Lord to worship, the first thing you need is somebody to render
   your worship acceptable. See there, in the Person of your Lord Jesus
   Christ, a golden censor, representing the sweet merit of His prevalent
   intercession by which you are accepted. When the High Priest went into
   the Holy Place, he filled this golden censer and waved it to and fro
   till the sweet perfumed smoke went up before the Mercy Seat. That is
   just what Jesus does in Heaven for us! We burn the incense here, below,
   and the sweet perfume of His merit continually ascends before the
   Throne of the Most High and Holy God. And beneath the cloud of smoke we
   worship. Jesus becomes a Sanctuary for us, and you can never worship
   God aright till you feel that Jesus' merits go with your worship. If
   your prayers are perfumed with the incense of your own merits and you
   think they will be acceptable, you know not what you are doing! But if
   you see that golden censer and look to God through the smoke of Jesus'
   merits, then do you really worship--and Christ thus becomes to you a
   Sanctuary!

   The other article of furniture in the Holy of Holies was the Mercy
   Seat--a square casket upon which were set cherubim with outstretched
   wings. It was before this Mercy Seat, perhaps, that all prayer had to
   be offered. There was only one place where Israel's gifts could really
   come up before God--and that was before the Mercy Seat. Now, Beloved,
   when we go to God, we cannot go directly to Him--we must go to the
   Mercy Seat first. "I will have nothing to do with an absolute God,"
   said Luther, and he was quite right. We may not come unto God except
   through Jesus Christ! We look towards God in the Person of His dear
   Son. God in the Son of Mary. God in the Man of Nazareth. God in the
   bleeding Sufferer of Calvary--we look there, and we look through Jesus
   Christ up to the unseen, but ever-glorious Father--and with Jesus'
   merits before us, with His precious blood before our mind's eye, we
   come to God through Jesus Christ--and we are accepted in the Beloved!

   But, Beloved, I am afraid that many Sundays, and many weekdays, too, we
   try to worship God without Christ! It will never do--it cannot succeed!
   If ever you come out of your closet without the sense of having put the
   blood before God, you have had a lost season of retirement! If you ever
   go out of this Tabernacle feeling that in all the worship there has
   been no sense of Christ's Presence, no thoughts of His precious
   blood--that worship has been worthless--the time has been wasted!
   Without the incense of His merit, without the Mercy Seat of His
   substitutionary Sacrifice, there is no Sanctuary, there is no worship,
   there is no drawing near to God!

   Inside the Mercy Seat, if you had been permitted to open the lid and
   look in, you would have seen three things. First, you would have seen a
   golden pot of manna. Now communion is one of the sweetest portions of
   worship. Communion is set forth in Scripture by eating bread with one
   another. So the eating of manna with God is typical of communion, but
   we get no manna unless it comes out of the golden pot of Christ! I find
   no manna, except it is concealed beneath the Mercy Seat--no eating with
   God unless we come through Jesus Christ. Do not, I beseech you, attempt
   to commune with God apart from a precious sense of a Crucified Savior!
   It is at the Cross' foot that Jacob's ladder stands, the top of which
   is in Heaven. If you would see a Covenant God, you must get the
   telescope of faith and stand at the foot of the Cross and look, for you
   shall see God nowhere but in Jesus! You shall feed upon heavenly manna
   nowhere but as you feed upon Christ!

   Another mode of worship is that of service, for to work for God is the
   best of service. Inside the Ark there was Aaron's rod that budded. What
   was that? It was Aaron's symbol of work when he was called to work for
   God. Do you want to know whether you are called to work for God? Look
   for your Aaron's rod in Christ! You will never have a rod that buds if
   you look away from the Lord to the visible Church. The Church may call
   you when you have no Divine vocation. There are thousands of priests
   who have had bishops' hands upon their heads, who are neither God's
   ministers nor truly called to minister among men! But if you see your
   calling in Christ, if you get Aaron's rod that budded, full of life and
   vigor, the Spirit of God will maintain you in your work. In your
   worship, then, and in your service, Christ must be your Sanctuary.

   One other thing was in the ark, and that was the tablets of stone, the
   perfect tablets of the unbroken Law of God fairly written out. If you
   desire to have the Law written on your hearts, if you desire to have
   perfect righteousness in keeping the Law of God, you must not try to
   approach God for yourselves, but you must come through the Mediator,
   Jesus Christ! He who would offer to God a perfect obedience must take
   the imputed righteousness of the Immaculate Son of God, and being
   arrayed in that, he shall worship God aright, Christ being a Sanctuary
   for him.

   I am very, very anxious that every Believer here should draw a ring, as
   it were, around himself and ask his heavenly Father for help, that he
   may draw near through the torn veil of the Savior's pierced body and
   come spiritually, with

   heart, and soul, and strength, near to the Throne of God, worshipping
   the Most High! Our third point is that Jesus is a Sanctuary in the
   sense of--

   II. A DWELLING PLACE.

   This is an unusual sense, perhaps, but it is a Scriptural one. "He that
   dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the
   shadow of the Almighty. In the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide
   me. He shall set me up upon the rock." The priest under the old Law
   only went into the Holy of Holies once a year, but every priest unto
   God--and you are all such who have believed--every priest unto God goes
   in and never goes out again--at least, he never needs to go out! He may
   abide always in the Holy Place--a place where in the morning he sings
   his waking song--and a place wherein at night he sups with Christ.

   The Sanctuary was a place in which only one Person ever dwelt, and that
   was God, Himself. The mysterious light which they called the Shekinah
   shone from between the wings of the cherubim. There were the pillar of
   cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night--the symbols of the Divine
   Presence. It was God's House. No man lived with Him, no man could. The
   High Priest went in but once a year, and out he went again to the
   solemn assembly. But now, in Christ Jesus, in whom dwells all the
   fullness of the Godhead, bodily, we find a Sanctuary to reside in, for
   we dwell in Him--we are one with Him! God was in Christ, reconciling
   the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. And as
   God was in Christ, so is it written, "You in Me, and I in you." Such is
   the union between Christ and His people. Every Believer is in Christ,
   even as God is in Christ. So Christ is the Sanctuary where God and man
   may meet together and live in perpetual delight and solace! My Beloved,
   do you always dwell in Christ? I wish I did. I find it comparatively
   easy to get fellowship with Christ, but oh, it is so difficult to keep
   it up. When one climbs the mountain, gets one's forehead bathed in the
   sunlight, talks with God and feels the world to be far below in the
   valley, one feels that it is good to be there! But ah, we are soon down
   again, mixing with the people, marrying and giving in marriage. We are
   fighting our battles and buying and selling again! Oh, that we could
   have Peter's wish and build three tabernacles, for it is good to be
   there, where the transfigured Master reveals Himself to His delighted
   people! Oh, that we could always live in the banqueting-house, and see
   that banner of love always floating over us! And let me tell you, we
   may do so! There have been some of the saints who have been helped to
   do it. They have been as much with God when they have been trading
   across the counter as when they have been bowing the knee--as much with
   Jesus in their daily toils as in their Sabbath rest! Why should it not
   be so with us? I covet. I covet beyond all luxuries, to walk with God!
   If I might have this, I would not ask for anything else beneath these
   skies--

   "Oh, that I might forever sit With Mary at the Master's feet To hear
   His gracious voice!"

   Oh, that I might go into the door of His House and never find my way
   out! If we leave the Table, it is not because the feast is over or the
   Master has dismissed the guests. Oh, never! You are not straitened in
   Him, but in yourselves. The deep bottomless sea of His precious love is
   all before you! If you thirst, it is because you will not drink! If you
   live in the cold Arctic regions, distant from Christ, it is not because
   the sunlight of His love could not warm and cheer you. If you would
   come into the equatorial regions of a simpler faith and a more abundant
   trustfulness, you might yet have all the luxuriance of a tropical heat
   sent into your souls! Come up higher, Brothers and Sisters! From the
   lowest chambers come to the highest ones! From the Master's feet come
   to His bosom, and from His bosom come to His lips. From the outside
   court or tabernacle come to the court of the priests, and from the
   court of the priests come to the Holiest of All. Advance! Come boldly!
   The Lord help you by His Spirit to come and dwell in the Sanctuary!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS 10:1-20.

   Verse 1. Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is
   that they might be saved. Now these people had persecuted the Apostle.
   Wherever he went they had followed him--they had hindered his
   work--they had sought his life and yet this was the only return that he
   made to them--to desire and pray that they might be saved! Let us never
   be turned aside from this loving desire for those among whom we dwell.
   We wish them nothing worse--we cannot wish

   them anything better than that they may be saved. Let us not only
   desire it, but let us prayfor it. Let us turn our desires into the more
   practical and holy form of intercession.

   2. For I bear them record that they have a zeal for God, but not
   according to knowledge. Always make allowance for anything that is good
   in those who, as yet, are not converted. We must not be unjust with
   them because we desire to be faithful to them.

   3. For they, being ignorant ofGod's righteousness, andgoing about to
   establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto
   the righteousness of God. And that is the great mischief with persons
   who are not saved. They are very sincere, very earnest, but they will
   not submit to the righteousness of God--they will not agree to be made
   righteous by the Grace of God through Jesus Christ. But they "go
   about"--that is the Apostle's word. It is very expressive of the energy
   men will put into it, and the shifts to which they will have recourse
   in order to work out a righteousness of their own. They will go about,
   yes, even to the very gates of Hell! They will try to climb up by
   prayers, even to the gates of Heaven! They will go about to establish
   their own righteousness, but they do not know the righteousness of
   God-- and they refuse to submit themselves to it.

   4. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness for everyone who
   believes. He that believes in Christ is as righteous as the Law of God
   could have made him, if he had kept it perfectly. The end of the law is
   righteousness, that is, the fulfilling of it--and he who has Christ
   will see the Law fulfilled in Christ, and the righteousness of Christ
   applied to himself!

   5. 6. For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That
   the man who does those things shall live by them. But the righteousness
   which is of faith speaks on this wise--Ah, that is a very different
   sort of thing! It does not speak about doing and living, "but the
   righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise."

   6-9. Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven? (That is, to
   bring Christ down from above). Or, Who shall descend into the deep?
   (That is, to bring up Christ again from the dead). But what does it
   say? The word is near you, even in your mouth, and in your heart that
   is, the word of faith which we preach. That if you shall confess with
   your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has
   raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved. There is the Gospel in a
   nutshell! What a very simple way it is--to believe these great facts
   about the Lord Jesus Chr-ist--really to believe them so that they
   became practical factors in your life. This is all the way of
   salvation. Christ has not to be fetched down. He has come! He has not
   to be sent up. He has risen from the dead! The work is finished! What
   you have to do is to believe in that finished work and accept it as
   your own--and you shall be saved!

   10. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness; and with the
   month confession is made unto salvation. How different all this from
   that going about to establish our own righteousness, this setting up of
   prayers, tears, church attendance, chapel attendance, good works and I
   know not what besides! Instead of that, here is Christ set forth and,
   "you are complete in Him." If you take Him to be yours, you are,
   "accepted in the Beloved," and "being justified by faith, you have
   peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Oh, what a blessing this
   is!

   11. For the Scripture says, Whoever believes on Him shall not be
   ashamed. Though he did much that he need be ashamed of, yet when the
   Law of God so brought him to believe in Jesus Christ for righteousness,
   he is righteous! And he is so righteous that he shall never be ashamed
   of his righteousness, nor ashamed of his faith in Christ! Would God
   that some who are going about after a righteousness of their own would
   be led to try this method and believe in Jesus Christ.

   12. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek. What a
   blessed word that is--"There is no difference between the Jew and the
   Gentile"! There are some who want to keep up that difference. They say
   that we are Israel, or something of the kind. I do not care what we
   are. There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek!

   12. For the same Lord over all is rich unto all who call upon Him.
   Someone said to me, "I think that the Romish Church cannot be a
   Christian Church. I do not think that the Church of England is a
   Christian Church. Do you think the Baptists are a Christian Church?'
   And my answer was, "The Christian Church is to be found mixed up in all
   churches, and no churches at all." It is a people that God has chosen
   from among men--and they are to be found here and there and
   everywhere--a spiritual seed that God has marked out to be His own! And
   they are known by this--that they call upon the Lord and, "the same
   Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him."

   13. For whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. We
   call upon that name by having confidence in it. By speaking to God in
   prayer, using that name. By adoring and reverently proclaiming the
   majesty and the name of God. Whoever shall call upon or invoke that
   great name shall be saved!

   14. How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?For
   at the bottom of the saving invocation or call there must be real
   faith. There cannot be any true worship of God unless it be grounded
   and bottomed upon faith in

   God.

   14. And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?
   There cannot be such a thing as believing what has never been spoken in
   our hearing, and has never been made known to us. Of course, reading
   often answers the same end as hearing. It is a kind of hearing of the
   Word, but a man must know, or he cannot believe.

   14. And how shall they hear without a preacher?How is that possible? Do
   you see the machinery of the Gospel? There is the calling upon the
   name. That comes of faith. There is the faith that comes of hearing,
   but there is the hearing that comes of preaching. Now a little farther.

   15. And how shall they preach, except they are sent?Poor preaching. It
   will not be the kind of preaching that produces believing hearing,
   except they are sent. If God does not send the man, he had better have
   stayed at home! It is only as God sends him that God will bless him. He
   is bound to back up His own messenger when he delivers God's own
   message. "How shall they preach, except they are sent?"

   15. As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them who preach the
   Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things. And they are so
   beautiful because, you see, God has put them at the root of everything.
   God makes the preacher whom He sends to be the source of so much good,
   or the channel of so much good, for by his preaching comes the hearing,
   and by the hearing comes the believing--and out of the believing comes
   the calling upon the name and the salvation!

   16. But they have not all obeyed the Gospel. "But." A sorrowful "but"
   is this. Oh, this is the mischief of it. The Gospel, then, has an
   authority about it--or else the Apostle would not speak of obeying the
   Gospel. Men are bound to believe what God declares to them, and their
   not believing is a disobedience! "They have not all obeyed the Gospel."

   16. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?As if there were
   so few that did believe it, that he had to ask who they were!

   17. So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. You
   are wise, therefore, dear Friend, if you are seeking salvation to be a
   hearer of the Word. But mind that it is the Word of God that you hear,
   because the word of man cannot save you. It may delude you. It may give
   you a false peace. But the hearing that saves is hearing which comes by
   the Word of God. Oh, take care, then, that you do not run here and
   there just because of the cleverness of certain speakers, but keep to
   the Word of God--whoever preaches it--for "faith comes by hearing, and
   hearing by the Word of God."

   18. But I say, Have they not heard?These very people for whom the
   Apostle prayed--have they not heard?

   18. Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words
   unto the ends of the world. The preaching of the Gospel went forth
   among those Israelites who rejected it. Wherever they went, the Gospel
   seemed to follow them like their shadows. They could not escape from
   it, but they did not believe it.

   19. But I say, Did not Israel know? Assuredly, Israel did know, but did
   not believe.

   19. First Moses says, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are
   no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. Moses told them
   that it would be so if they rejected Christ. Christ would be preached
   to the Gentiles, and those whom they thought to be foolish would come
   in and accept what they had rejected!

   20. But Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found of them that sought
   Me not: I was made manifest unto them that asked not after Me. He told
   them, therefore, that God would save a people who up to now had never
   sought after God-- that He would send the Gospel to a people that were
   dead in sin, and had never asked to receive the light and life of God!

A Type and Its Teaching

   (No. 3523)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 3, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Abraham said, My son, God willprovide Himself a lamb for a burnt
   offering." Genesis 22:8.

   How stern the trial! How striking the triumph! How sublime, both in
   action and passion, was the faith of Abraham in that terrible crisis.
   It pleased God to try him on a very tender point. Abraham had received
   a great promise, on the fulfillment of which he greatly relied. Year
   after year elapsed, but no sign of the long-looked-for child appeared.
   At length old age crept over the Patriarch and his wife. Still he
   looked steadfastly for the promise because he believed implicitly in
   the Promiser. He considered not the infirmities of his own body, nor
   the deadness of Sarah's womb--he waited patiently, not doubting that
   God would, in due time, according to His promise, give him a son. What
   marvel, then, that this son, when born, should be the object of
   Abraham's fondest affection? Moreover, a strange halo of hope gathers
   round the lad's head, for God has made him the heir of a Covenant. It
   is in Isaac and in Isaac's seed that God will fulfill His Covenant
   which He has made with Abraham. No, something still more mysterious is
   linked with that youth's life. It is in him that all the nations of the
   earth will be blessed. And now, when the Lord says, "Take your son,
   your only son Isaac, whom you love," there is a cut in every word at
   the most tender part of Abraham's soul. To slay his own son, to cut off
   his hope of posterity, to sacrifice for a burnt-offering that son who
   was a special gift of God's bounty, to kill him in whom he looked for a
   further fulfillment of God's promise--to stop that golden pipe through
   which mercy is to flow to the whole world, to dam up that silver stream
   which is to enrich nations yet unborn--that were to blast Abraham's
   brightest hopes as well as to wound his most tender affections! God has
   cherished in him high anticipations. He has been pleased to give him
   strength of mind and faith of heart enough to see these expectations
   realized in a vision. And must that vision, after all, flit from before
   his eyes? Must his faith become a delusion and all his hopes a mockery?
   So it would seem! And yet mark the faith of Abraham--he not only
   submits to the loss of his choicest jewel, and to tear away one who was
   bound to his heart by ties stronger than flesh and blood--but in doing
   it, he staggers not, for he still believes that God will be true to His
   promise!

   It strikes me that this was the master work of Abraham's faith. To
   sacrifice Isaac was a wonder of patient submission and devout
   resignation, but the faith which was at the root of it all challenges
   our highest admiration! Still, to believe that God is able to raise
   Isaac from the dead, or to turn the stones which were wet with Isaac's
   blood into a new offspring, or, (for I know not which theory Abraham
   may have adopted), to believe that the whole Covenant was spiritual and
   that he must wait to see the seed of Isaac in another world, and not in
   this--in any case to believe that God must be true, that though Isaac
   died, God would keep His word and that He is able to do so
   notwithstanding all apparent impossibilities--that He will transmute
   stones to men, or raise that body after it has been slain, into newness
   of life--here was the climax of a faith that realized the grandeur and
   the goodness of the Divine Attributes and perfections, for he simply
   and sincerely believed and relied upon God!

   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, there are some men who can make great
   sacrifices for God--they have done so and herein they have emulated the
   example of Abraham. But the Patriarch showed a clear understanding, an
   unwavering calmness, a full assurance of hope to which few have
   attained. When in the very fact of presenting to God your sacrifice,
   can you account that you are losing nothing, but committing your
   treasure to His custody? Can you believe that the promise of God is not
   compromised by your parting with the earnest that gladdened your eyes?
   Has God given you a son, such an one as you can say of, "For this child
   I prayed"? Is he the pride of your life and the joy of your life? Do
   you think of him as the solace of your age and the perpetuator of your
   name in the world? What, now, if God shall call you to devote him

   as a missionary? Could you readily comply? Would you count it all gain?
   Could you interpret it as a blighting of your own prospect, or as a
   blooming of God's purpose? Have you Abraham's faith? Then let God be
   true if Heaven should reel and earth should rock! Though the sons of
   men pass away like shadows and death entombs us all, the counsel of
   God's heart shall stand and His Word shall endure forever!

   Stagger not, my Friends, at the promise of God through unbelief! Be
   assured that whatever He has promised, He is able to perform!

   Such reflections, though prolific of instruction, I must not tarry to
   pursue. I rather want to impress the scene and interpret the sentence
   brought before us in our text.

   The scene itself suggests to us three pictures. The first picture will
   naturally rise up in your imagination without my attempting any graphic
   description of it. The old man, a kind and doting father, bears in his
   hands a sharp knife, and hot blazing coals of fire. The younger man,
   perhaps twenty-five--so Josephus thinks--possibly 33 years of age and,
   if so, very manifestly the type of Christ, who was about that age when
   He came to die. The young man comes toiling up the side of the hill,
   bearing a load of wood upon his back. He knows that that wood is
   destined to burn some victim, for his father carries the fire and the
   knife. He understands that they are about to worship God yonder in the
   most solemn manner by a sacrifice of blood. On the way he puts but one
   question, marveling where the victim can be. He sees the fire and the
   wood, but where is the lamb? he asks. Abraham tells him with a bursting
   heart, that--

   I. GOD WILL PROVIDE HIMSELF A LAMB.

   Little did Isaac think that he was to be that lamb! They came to the
   spot. No doubt Abraham there tells Isaac what God had bid him do. The
   young man is strong--the old man has lost some of his youthful vigor.
   If that young man chose to struggle, the intent would be frustrated.
   But he, like his father, is ready to say to that Sovereign command of
   God, "Here I am." He allows himself to be bound by his aged sire, no,
   helps to put himself upon the altar! And there he lies, a willing
   victim, cheerfully consenting to be bound, willing then and there to
   die at God's command!

   Here you have a picture of the Almighty One, whom we every day address
   as, "Our Father, who are in Heaven." You see His son, His only Son,
   whom He loves. His Isaac, who has filled His heart with gladness. He
   bears upon his back the load of wood--the Cross--no, heavier than the
   Cross is the load which the antitype of Isaac, our blessed Jesus,
   bears-- the sin of all His people lay heavy upon His shoulders. He
   turns upwards to the hill of Calvary and there, in that thick darkness,
   through which no human eye could peer, however much it might desire it,
   God, the eternal Father, binds His Son! He cheerfully submits Himself
   to be fastened to the tree. The Omnipotent hand unsheathes the knife to
   slay His Son, and draws not back, but in Sovereign Vengeance slays Him!
   That picture of Abraham--the knife in his hand, about to execute
   Isaac--presents to you a picture of the God of gods about to smite His
   only-begotten Son upon Mount Calvary!

   Beloved, the one point an which I wish to concentrate your attention is
   the emotion of the Father. Oh, what grief, what love, what pity! What
   stern resolve and strong affections must have striven together in
   Abraham's bosom! We read an ancient story of a father whose two sons
   were taken prisoners. They were both condemned to die. The old man
   appeared on the scene to offer up his life--all that he had to
   offer--and to die, himself, if his sons' lives might be spared. For
   some reason the soldiers, melting to pity, went as far as they could,
   and told him he might have whichever of his sons he chose to be spared
   for the ransom. He looked first at one, and then at the other. He would
   gladly say, "Spare that one," but then they would put the other to
   death! And he would gladly say, "Spare this one," but then the other
   must die! And so the old man alternated between one and the other,
   undecided which should be released, till both were slain! History tells
   us of another case at the siege of Benda. A German nobleman, seeing a
   young man charging the hosts of the besiegers, remarked to those who
   stood by how valiantly he was fighting--he felt that a hero was in the
   camp. The enemy gathered so thickly round the warrior that at length he
   fell. "Give that young man a public funeral," said the nobleman. His
   counsel was accepted, a charge was made, the body was rescued. But
   judge his surprise as he looked down upon the face of the young man and
   perceived it was his only son! He stood aghast for a moment, no tears
   could he shed--his eyes were as though they would start from their
   sockets--he seemed transfixed. He fell backward--his heart was
   broken--his soul had taken its flight. Such a surprise, such a sorrow,
   such a sense of the loss he had sustained overwhelmed him. In neither
   of these cases had the father any hand in the death of his child. The
   parent in each instance was passive.

   Here, however, the knife must be handled by none other than the sire,
   and plunged into the vitals of his son. Oh, Abraham! Ah, Isaac--the
   tale of your trial makes my nerves tingle. But who of all the heavenly
   host, what angel near the

   Throne of God can tell of the Eternal Father, how His heart was moved,
   how His heart yearned! Do I speak after the manner of men? How else can
   I speak?

   Reprove me when you can believe in a God who has no feelings, no
   emotions, no affections, no life, no love. Hardly could I subscribe to
   the dictum of theologians who pronounce God incapable of suffering!
   Surely He is capable of anything! He is Sovereign of all senses and
   sacred sensibilities! His benignant tender Fatherhood are as clear to
   my faith as His eternal power and Godhead! How, then, can I conceive of
   His putting His own Son to death without a grief that I must defer to
   as possible, because I cannot describe it as actual? If we may not
   liken ourselves to God, yet may God liken Himself to us! This He has
   done, otherwise had we not known Him. Can you smite your own child
   without feeling more anguish than you inflict? Solomon says, "Spare not
   for his crying"--but it is hard to keep Solomon's advice, for the
   crying of your child makes you weep more than he does! Yet, behold how
   God, full of love, His very name being Love, smites even to the death
   His Only-Begotten, till that Darling cries out, "My God, My God, why
   have You forsaken Me?" And this was done out of love to us! "He that
   spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He
   not with Him also freely give us all things?" Oh, what love! His love
   is an indefinite quantity! It is expressed by an indefinite word--so!
   "God soloved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever
   believes in Him might not perish, but have everlasting life." What
   measure or gauge can compass that wonderful affirmation--He so loved
   Rude as my sketch may be--royal, indeed--is the scene! Let it be
   vividly portrayed on the tablet of your memories. Let its gracious
   effect diffuse itself over your hearts! Oh, for such love as angels
   cannot know, let us reciprocate with a love intense and vehement that
   inflames our whole heart--

   "Had we a thousand hearts to give Lord, they should all be Yours." Even
   now, with adoring gratitude, offer your homage to the Father, who gives
   His Son, and to that Son who cheerfully submits to plead by the altar
   for our sins.

   A second picture rises to our view. You will remember that our Lord
   Jesus once said, "Abraham saw My day." When did he see it? Why, I think
   it must have been on this occasion! The venerable Patriarch certainly
   had in his son Isaac-- II. A VIVID PICTURE OF THE SON OF GOD.

   When you see that his hand is stayed, you perceive at once that the
   portrait is not complete. A ram is caught in the thicket. This ram is
   caught, laid hold on, dragged out and put into the place of Isaac. So
   far the delineation is accurate, for the ram dies. It is really slain,
   even as Christ was sacrificed for us. But the vision changes its form.
   Isaac goes free-- not so the ram! Isaac's blood still flows in his
   veins--not so that of the poor ram, the knife sternly severs his
   arteries and the blood flows out. There he is laid upon the wood, which
   forthwith begins to glow and smoke for a burnt offering. Isaac gazes on
   himself in a burning figure--he owes his life to the victim that was
   presented as a substitute. Look earnestly, gaze intently, linger fondly
   on the picture, for it represents your own salvation! Let us take the
   place of Isaac--it is ours. We are children according to promise. If
   we, Beloved, have "fled for refuge to the hope set before us," we are
   saved. How we are saved you know. Because our Lord Jesus Christ, the
   ram of God's burnt-offering, did burn upon the altar for us, we are
   spared. It would baffle me to tell how Isaac felt when cords were
   unbound and he saw how narrowly he had escaped from death. Nor can I
   tell you how I felt when standing at the foot of the Cross--

   "Ibeheld the flowing Of my dear Redeemer's blood, With assurance,
   knowing He had made my peace with God." How can you perish, Believer,
   now that Christ has died for you? There is not a cord on Isaac as you
   see him now. He is free. So are you, my Friend--there are no bonds on
   you. Most gratefully can you cry with David, "I am Your servant; and
   the son of Your handmaid; You have loosed my bonds." As you gather
   round the Lord's Table, let the thought of Substitution be fresh in
   your mind. He bore, that we might never bear the Divine Wrath. He drank
   the cup, even to its dregs, that we might never drink a drop of it. In
   short, He suffered Hell's torments for us, that we might never enter
   its gates. My Hearers, did Christ thus suffer for you? Yes, surely, if
   so you are believing and depending upon Him, then He was your true and
   proper Substitute! Or if in His life you have no interest, then in His
   death you have no Redemption-- and His blood shall never save you!
   Alas, alas, you must perish in your sins!

   Pass from that scene. Inspect it more narrowly, more privately another
   time. Let me now unveil to you another picture. Behold the aged parent,
   with glistening eyes and placid brow, receiving his son, as it were,
   alive from the dead, when the angel stayed his hand. How joyously he
   cuts those cords! How they seem to leap together! I think I see them
   going homeward down the side of the hill to the tent where Sarah was.
   With what elastic step, with what grateful emotion, with what heartfelt
   joy they journey! And of what is this an emblem?

   III. THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST JESUS--and in that of the resurrection
   of every Believer! The Apostle Paul says that, "Abraham received Isaac
   from the dead in a figure." Now our Covenant God and Father has
   received His Only-Begotten from the dead, not merely in figure, but in
   reality! The morning has broken, the sun has risen on the third day. He
   cannot be held by the bonds of death any longer. He snaps them asunder
   and in incomparable beauty, the once slain Savior arises refreshed from
   His sleep! The stone had been rolled away by the angel. He comes out
   and the watchmen, in terror, fall on their faces in fright! He
   manifests Himself to Mary and then to His disciples afterwards, saying,
   "Peace be unto you," and in due time He ascends up to the right hand of
   the Majesty in Heaven. Angel hosts escort Him with trumpets' joyful
   sound--

   "They bring His chariot from on high, To bear Him to His Throne! Clap
   their triumphant wings, and cry, 'The glorious work is done!'"

   Oh, you saints, celebrate the triumph afresh! Your Lord and Savior is
   risen and ascended! Isaac is not dead! He, in whom all nations of the
   earth shall be blessed, lives, forever lives! In Him, the Child of
   promise, the Seed of the woman, are you now a heritor of the blessing
   if you believe! In Him shall you rise again! Though your flesh shall
   see corruption, you shall burst the bonds of death and, because He
   lives, you shall live also--

   "Nor does it yet appear-How great you shall be made, Yet when you see
   your Savior here, You shall be like your Head."

   Have these pictures impressed your minds? May the meditation they
   excite prove instructive to you! But lend me your ears while I proceed
   to commend to you the sweet prophetic words of Abraham.

   The name of the Lord--that particular name, Jehovah-Jireh--has been the
   comfort of many an indigent Believer, and sustained him under great
   difficulty. Sometimes it has been to him like the cake baked upon the
   coals, of which Elijah partook when he journeyed for 40 days. Oh, how
   graciously God has provided Himself a burnt-offering! The choicest
   Substitute for the most undeserving criminals. Lies there a wretch in
   Newgate for whom a royal heir would stand surety? No novelist would
   broach such a fiction! "Scarcely for a righteous man will one die;
   perhaps for a good man one might even dare to die; but God commends His
   love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for the
   ungodly." If every one of us had been left to endure the penalty of our
   own transgressions--had no Substitute been found to bear our sins--God
   would have been unimpeachably just and infinitely glorious!

   The voice of our torments would have only been a deep bass note to tell
   the universe the terrible justice of the Most High! It could not have
   impeached His mercy. To find a Substitute was an act of gratuitous,
   undeserved Grace. Such provision was not only undeserved, but it was
   most unexpected. What amazement must have wrapped the sky when
   celestial creatures heard that a Substitute for man was found! Where?
   Among angels, principalities, or powers? No, but at God's right hand!
   The co-equal Son, Himself, becomes the Substitute for rebel man! Nor
   less in dignity than the brightness of the Father's Glory, and the
   express image of His Person, is He who takes upon Himself flesh and
   blood and subjects Himself to our infirmities, that He, Himself, may
   bear our sins in His own body on the tree! Are we indifferent, or are
   incredulous, or what manner of men are we that one can talk and another
   can listen to so startling a fact, to so astounding a revelation
   without a thrilling emotion, a faltering tongue and tingling ears?
   Throughout eternity this will be a ceaseless wonder in Heaven, that the
   Creator should stoop to bear the creature's sin will never cease to be
   a mystery of Mercy that challenges endless admiration! God did, indeed,
   provide such a provision as makes His Providence startling! What a
   Gospel it is! Great God, will You redeem sinners at such a cost, at no
   less price than blood and that the blood of Imma-nuel? And is it so
   that Jehovah must veil Himself in human flesh? Must the Infinite become
   an Infant? Must the Omnipotent hang on a woman's breast? Must the
   eternal self-existent God breathe out an expiring life in ignominy and
   torture?

   Must all this be experienced by the Man who is Jehovah's Fellow? Yes.
   Manhood comes into such union with Deity that we cannot divide the two!
   There is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man, Christ
   Jesus. Oh, what a step was this from the highest Throne of Glory to the
   Cross of deepest woe! Well did an Apostle say, "You were not redeemed
   with corruptible things, such as silver and gold, but with the precious
   blood of Christ." Silver and gold? What are they in comparison with
   this costly Sacrifice? The merest tinsel, the sweepings of dross, not
   worthy to be thought of in the same minute as the precious blood of
   Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish and without spot!

   St. Augustine somewhere holds a kind of controversy with himself as to
   whether Christ shall die or not. As if he said, "Yes, let the sinner
   live, but Christ must die. No, He must not die! He is far too good, too
   great to die! Then let the creature die. No, but we cannot let the
   creature perish, God's mercy would prevent that. Then He must die."
   Then he seems to say, "No, the price is too great. Sooner let them
   perish than buy them at such a price! A company of worms redeemed by
   the blood of the Son of God? The price is too high! Yet God paid it.
   Oh, let us love and bless His name!"

   Though it was so costly a provision, it was the most suitable that
   could be devised! Who else could have borne our sins but God? No mere
   man could possibly have stood as the substitute for millions of the
   human race! He might, if innocent, himself, suffer for one, and so save
   one, but unless Deity should lend its unutterable perfections, it was
   not possible for human nature to sustain the weight of human guilt! But
   now by the suffering of a Man, the Law is vindicated and honored! By
   the personal interposition of God, sacred validity and Sovereign
   efficacy are imparted to the great work He has achieved. And oh, what
   an effectual provision it is! For the blood of Christ has saved, does
   save and will save millions of souls! Whatever else may be a myth, the
   Atonement is a veritable fact! Whatever empty rites and worthless
   pretensions may be foisted on credulous men and silly women, you cannot
   exasperate the power of the blood of Christ! Come here, come here, you
   blackest, foulest, vilest of mankind! Try it and see if the crimson
   streams do not wash your crimson stains, and make you white as snow!
   Come here, you old transgressors, steeped in infamy, quivering on the
   brink of Hell, see if the drops of this blessed stream cannot cool your
   fevered brow and give your troubled conscience rest! Come here, you
   distracted maniacs who would gladly lay suicidal hands upon yourselves,
   and rush blood-red into your Maker's awful Presence, and see if, bowing
   down before that awful Cross, you do not hear a voice that says,
   "Peace. Be still. Go your way, your sins, which are many, are forgiven
   you." Yes, there is life in a look at the Crucified One! None shall
   ever look to Him in vain! Millions of spirits around the Throne of God
   rejoice in the efficacy of God's provision. Jehovah-Jireh is extolled
   today in matchless songs of human praise around the starry Throne! And
   here on earth we repeat their strains with glad accord--

   "DDear, dying Lamb, Your precious blood Shall never lose its power,
   Till all the ransomed Church of God Are saved to sin no more."

   And then, once more, it is an ample provision. God has provided a ram
   for a burnt-offering and there is enough efficacy in that sacrifice for
   all that seek the ransom it supplies. I do not preach a stinted
   salvation, blessed be God! I have seen in my soul the vision that
   Zachariah saw. He saw a young man with a measuring line in his hand.
   "Where are you going? he asked. "To take the dimensions of Jerusalem,"
   he replied, "to record the breadth and the length thereof." "Run, speak
   to this young man," said the angels, "measure not the city! Jerusalem
   shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitudes of men
   therein."

   Some people have a strange disposition to use the measuring line and
   count the population, and number the souls that are saved by the
   precious blood of Jesus. Their estimate is commonly limited to a very
   few. Let us not measure it, for we know not what countless multitudes
   will be given to Christ for the travail of His soul. A multitude that
   no man can number has already been gathered! To come is a host, defying
   human arithmetic, that will lie marshaled there and still they muster
   day by day. O Beloved, this one thing we know, without entering into
   any vexed questions of Particular Redemption or General Redemption,
   there is enough in Christ for every sinner that desires salvation and
   comes and puts his trust in Him--enough to cleanse the vilest sin that
   ever disgraced humanity--enough to wash you white, though you are ever
   so begrimed! It is provision for the sins of all ages, of all ranks, of
   all conditions! The harlot, cleansed here, becomes chaste and sings,
   with Rahab, the new song! The thief, washed here, becomes forgiven and
   is accepted in the Beloved! If you are the most abandoned of sinners
   and have strolled in here to gratify curiosity or to idle away an hour,
   let me tell you that He who died--the Just for the unjust--always lives
   and He is mighty to save! Rest on Jesus! There is

   provision here to save you! With His infinite foreknowledge He has
   foreseen your case. You shall never find a case too hard for the
   Master--no sin too heinous for Him to forgive, no circumstance so
   extravagant in its guilt as to go beyond the Grace and the generosity
   which are treasured up in Christ Jesus--and the goodness and virtue
   flowing from His wounds!

   I have painted the pictures. I have proclaimed the purpose. Let me
   conclude with-- IV. A POINTED QUESTION.

   Since God has provided so great a Sacrifice, has He provided it for me?
   Am I a participator in the blood of Christ? To how many thousands of
   you do I speak? Let each one put the question to himself. My weak voice
   will soon exhaust its emphasis. Is there no echo in your conscience?
   What I say may drop from your memories. Let every soul among you
   earnestly enquire, "Have I Christ?" Give yourself a candid reply
   concerning yourself. Do you put your trust in Him? I do not ask you
   what possessions you can boast! The poor are very welcome in God's
   House. I do not ask you what reputation you have. The wise are not
   elected for their wisdom with God! The foolish and the base are not
   rejected for their worthlessness! What I do ask is this, "Have you
   Christ for your portion?" Remember, Soul, that whoever believes in
   Jesus receives Him as God's gift to his soul. Trust Christ and He is
   yours! Fall flat upon your face upon the promises of God in Christ!
   Have done with all the props on which you were known to lean, with all
   the pleas on which you were known to rely, with all the works of which
   you were known to boast! Go as you are to Christ, trust Him. To Him the
   Spirit of God leads every earnest, anxious seeker. If you trust Him,
   Heaven and earth may pass away, but the promise of Your salvation shall
   not fail. You shall be His in life, in death, in judgment, and all
   eternity, safe from Hell, secure in Heaven!

   What if you struggle with all your natural feelings as Abraham did? The
   more simple your faith, the more sure will be your triumph! Believe in
   the dark and you shall soon come into the light. As soon as you
   believe, there are signs following. Venture today to lay your hands
   upon that dear head of the victim Lamb, and tomorrow I will summon you
   as witnesses who can testify to others that there is joy and peace in
   believing! "He will deliver your soul from going down into the Pit, and
   your life shall see the light. Lo, all these things God often works
   with man, to bring his soul back from the edge of the Pit to be
   enlightened with the light of the living!" May this be yours! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HOSEA 11.

   1. When Israel was a child, I loved him, and called My son out of Egypt
   God remembers what He did for us when we were young. And sin against
   Him is much aggravated by His long kindness to us. He brings this up
   against His rebellious people, "When Israel was a child, I loved him."
   Some of you may remember your childhood with deep regret--when you used
   to sing your hymn and bow your knees on your mother's lap. Times have
   greatly changed since then, but God remembers them.

   2. As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto
   Baalim, and burned incense to carved images. These people only had to
   be called away, and away they went. There are some of that sort. You
   have only to beckon them anywhere. Like a dog that is whistled to, they
   will follow anybody's call. They leave God for anything, for nothing.
   These people went and forgot the true God and burned incense to carved
   images.

   3. I taught Ephraim also to walk, taking them by their arms: but they
   knew not that I healed them. God describes Himself as acting like a
   nurse that holds a child up by its arms and teaches it its first steps.
   Yet they did not know what God was doing for them! God has done great
   things for many of us, and perhaps we have never recognized His
   command. Years of mercy, and yet never a day of gratitude! It is sad
   that it should be so.

   4. I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to
   them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I stooped and
   fed them. As the good farmer, when the oxen come to the end of the
   field, takes off the yoke and puts on the nosebag, so has God often
   done with us in the day of our trouble. He has unyoked us and He has
   relieved our needs and fed us. Yet we have forgotten Him.

   5. 6. He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian
   shall be his king, because they refused to return. And the sword shall
   abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them,
   because of their own counsels. When men will have their own way, God
   sometimes lets them have their way--and that turns out to be the most
   unhap-

   py thing that can be! They make a rod for their own backs. They pile
   the firewood for their own burning. It is a great pity that it should
   be so, but often and often have we seen it.

   7. And My people are bent on backsliding from Me: though they called on
   the Most High, none at all would exalt Him. There is a propensity in
   the human heart to go away from God--even in the hearts of God's own
   people! Oh, how sad it is that, though often called to God by the voice
   of Providence, and by the call of His Word, yet none at all would exalt
   Him!

   8. How shall I give you up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver you, Israel?
   How shall I make you as Admah? How shall I set you as Zeboim? My heart
   is turned within Me, My sympathy is stirred. God represents Himself as
   holding a controversy within Himself. "These people I must punish.
   These people I love. I shall have to give them up. I cannot give them
   up." Justice debating with Mercy, and Mercy triumphant over Justice!

   9. I will not execute the fierceness of My anger, I will not return to
   destroy Ephraim: for I am God and not man: the Holy One in the midst of
   you; and I will not enter into the city. Remember that when God entered
   into Sodom and saw its sin, then He destroyed it! But He determines to
   have pity upon Samaria, and not to enter into it, lest, seeing it, He
   should feel compelled to destroy it.

   10. They shall walk after the LORD: He shall roar like a lion--If God
   can make His people follow Him when He roars like a lion, how we ought
   to follow Him who is the Lamb of God, who takes our sins upon Him!

   10. When He shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.
   When God puts on the lion's form and His grave, majestic voice is
   heard, full of thundering threats--then men are constrained and
   tremble!

   11. They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the
   land of Assyria. They shall come on hasty wings, trembling along, to
   find a shelter.

   11, 12. And I will place them in their houses, says the LORD. Ephraim
   compasses about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit It is a
   dreadful thing when men go to God and, as it were, make a ring round
   about Him and compass Him about with falsehood and with lies. Many
   profess to worship God when they are not worshipping at all. Their
   bodies are in the assembly of the saints, but their minds are far away.

   12. But Judah yet rules with God, and is faithful with the saints. And
   it was to the honor of Judah that it was so. When others are false,
   then is the time for God's servants to be true. If you held your tongue
   before, speak out for God and His Truth in the day when God is
   compassed about with deceit!

"Do I Love the Lord or Not?"

   (No. 3524)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 10, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Peter was grieved because He said unto Aim the third time, Do you love
   Me?" John 21:17.

   THIS is a pointed question which demands a personal answer and should,
   therefore, stir up full and frequent self-examination. "Do you love
   Me?" It is a probing question that is likely to excite much grief when
   pressed home to the sensitive, tender-hearted disciple, even as Peter
   was grieved because the Lord said unto him the third time, "Do you love
   Me?" Yet it is a pleasing and profitable question to as many of us as
   can give a like solemn and satisfactory response to that of Simon
   Peter, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You."

   I. IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT ALL DISCIPLES, EVEN THE MOST PRIVILEGED,
   THE MOST TALENTED AND THE MOST FAMOUS, SHOULD OFTEN BE ASKED THE
   QUESTION--HEAR IT IN THEIR SOULS AND FEEL ITS THRILLING
   INTENSITY--"SIMON, SON OF JONAS, DO YOU LOVE ME?"

   It must have been momentous, indeed, or the Savior would not have
   repeated it to Peter three times at one interview. He tarried on earth
   but 40 days after His Resurrection. The opportunities for conferences,
   therefore, with His disciples would be few. On what subjects, then,
   should He speak to them but those which appeared to Him of the
   weightiest import? Of the times or the seasons that must presently
   transpire, He refrains to divulge a secret. With the fulfillment of
   ancient predictions that prompted the curiosity of the Jew, or the
   solution of metaphysical problems that harassed the minds of Gentile
   philosophers, He did not meddle. I neither find Him interpreting
   obscure prophecy, nor expounding mystic Doctrine--but instead, thereof,
   I find Him inculcating personal piety! The question He propounds is of
   such vital importance that all other questions may be set aside till
   this one question is positively settled, "Do you love Me?"

   Hence, Beloved, I infer that it is of infinitely more consequence for
   me to know that I love Christ than it is to know the meaning of the
   little horn, or the ten toes, or the four great beasts! All Scripture
   is profitable to those who have Grace to profit by it, but would you
   both save yourself and those who hear you, you must know Him and love
   Him to whom Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles all bear witness that
   there is salvation in none other, and no other name given under Heaven
   whereby we must be saved! You may whet your appetite for logic, but you
   cannot, with your heart, believe unto righteousness while you occupy
   your thoughts, your tongues, or your pens wrangling about Calvinism and
   Armi-nianism, sublapsarianism and supra-lapsarianism, or any of the
   endless controversies of the schoolmen and sectarians! "Do you love
   Me?" that is the moot point! Can you give an affirmative answer? Will
   your conscience, your life, your God, attest the verity of your love to
   Him? Then, though you are no doctor of divinity, though you cannot
   decipher the niceties of systematic theology, though you are unable to
   rebut one in a thousand of the subtleties of the adversary, yet you
   have an unction from the Holy One! Your love approves you, your faith
   has saved you and He whom your soul loves will keep you for time and
   for eternity--you are blessed! To my mind, I say, the gravity of the
   question is palpable from the time at which it was put. During the few
   days of our risen Lord's sojourn, He would not have given it such
   distinct prominence had it not been, in Peter's case, the evidence of
   his repentance, his restoration and the full recognition he received.

   But, Brothers and Sisters, what question can more closely appeal to
   ourselves, to each one of us? Love is one of the most vital of the
   Christian Graces. If faith is the eye of the soul, without which we
   cannot see our Lord savingly, surely love is the very heart of the soul
   and there is no spiritual life if love is absent! I will not say that
   love is the first Grace, for faith first discovers that Christ loves
   us, and then we love Him because He first loved us. Love may be second
   in order, but it is not second in importance. I may say of faith and
   love, that these are like two roes that are twins--or rather of faith,

   and hope, and love, that these are three Divine sisters who mutually
   support one another--the health of one betokening the vigor of all, or
   the decline in one the weakness of all. "Do you love Me?" Why, the
   question means, Are you a Christian? Are you a disciple? Are you saved?
   For if any man love wife, or child, or house more than Christ, he is
   not worthy of Him. Christ must have from every one of His disciples,
   the heart's warmest affection! And where that is not freely accorded,
   depend upon it, there is no true faith and, consequently, no salvation,
   no spiritual life. On your answer to that question hangs your present
   state. Do you love Jesus? If the answer is, "No," then you are still in
   the gall of bitterness and the bonds of iniquity! But if the truthful
   answer of your soul is, "You know all things; You know that I love
   You," then, weak as you are, you are a saved soul--and with all your
   mourning and trembling, your doubts and misgivings, the Spirit of God
   bears witness with your spirit that you are born from above! The
   sincerity of your love to Christ shows more plainly than anything, the
   verity of your relation to Him!

   Oh, what searching of heart this question demands! Do not flatter
   yourselves with any false confidence. Many persons have been deceived
   upon this matter. Alas, they are partial judges who sit in judgment of
   themselves--for every defect they have an excuse--they find mitigating
   circumstances to whitewash their basest crimes. No marvel to me, but
   infinite pity for them that they choose their own delusions and become
   the dupes of their own infatuation! Their feelings, enhanced by the
   music of a hymn, or impassioned by the fervor of a sermon, they mistake
   for an inspiration of faith and love--and when the emotions pass off,
   as they quickly do--they grow loud in their professions. At first their
   own hearts were deceived. At length they practice deception on others.
   O you church members! I beseech you, do not conclude that you are
   members of the invisible Church because you are members of the visible
   Church! Though your names may be inscribed on the roll of the faithful,
   here, do not be too sure that they are written in the Lamb's Book of
   Life! Never take your position before God for granted. Do not shrink
   from a rigid scrutiny as those who never dare ask the question! Do not
   disparage self-examination like those who dare to think it is the devil
   who sets them to the task when he would beset them with legal terrors!
   Believe me, Satan is too fond of lulling you into presumption to aid or
   abet in awakening you to make sure of your condition! There is a gross
   infatuation which is the counterfeit of faith in God. Its credulous
   victims believe a lie and they fondly cling to it like limpets to a
   rock. But sound Believers are not afraid of vigilant
   self-examination--they are prepared to endure an even more severe
   test--they say, "Search me, God, and try me." It is your hollow
   dissemblers who resent all questionings and take umbrage at any
   suspicions. The man who knows that he has pure gold to sell is not
   afraid of the chemicals with which the goldsmith tests it, nor even of
   the crucible into which he may cast it. Not so the impostor who hawks a
   baser metal--he entreats you to be satisfied with his warranty, though
   it is as worthless as his wares! Search yourselves! Examine yourselves,
   whether you are in the faith! Prove yourselves! Know you not that Jesus
   Christ is in you, except you are reprobates?" By the cries of souls
   who, concerning faith, have made shipwreck, while they dreamed they
   were sailing gloriously into harbor--I beseech you make sure work for
   eternity and take care that your answer to the question, "Do you love
   Me," is well weighed, truthful and sincere--lest you should crash on
   the same reefs and be lost. Forever lost!

   And, dear Friends, I am sure the more closely we examine ourselves, the
   more need for self-examination we shall discover. Can you not recollect
   much in the tone of your thoughts and the temper of your actions that
   might well lead you to suspect that you do not love Christ? If this is
   not so with all of you, I know it is so with me. Mournfully must I
   confess that when I look back upon my past service for my Master, I
   could wish to blot it out with tears of penitent compunction, so far as
   my share in it has been concerned! Wherein He has used me, let Him have
   all the glory, for to Him it belongs. His be the praise! For me there
   remains shame and confusion of face because of the coldness of my
   heart, the feebleness of my faith, the presumption with which I have
   trusted to my own understanding and the resistance I have offered to
   the motions of the Holy Spirit. Alas for the carnality of our minds,
   the worldliness of our projects and our forgetfulness of God in times
   of ease! It is strange to me if we have not all cause to mourn over
   delinquencies like these. And if it is so with those of us who still
   can honestly say that we know we love our Lord, what scruples, what
   perilous scruples might some of you entertain whose conduct, character
   and the tenor of your lives may well raise a graver question!

   You imagine that you love Christ. Have you fed His lambs? Have you fed
   His sheep? Have you given that proof which our Savior imperatively
   requires of you? What are you doing for Him now? It is poor love that
   spends itself in professions and never comes to any practical result!
   Let this enquiry, then, pass round--

   "What have I done for Him who died

   To save my precious soul?"

   Alas, then, if instead of having, like the beloved Persis, labored much
   in the Lord (Rom 16:12), might we not, some of us, suspect ourselves of
   having so acted as rather to dishonor His name? Are you not tenderly
   conscious that Christian people full often lend their sanction by a
   loose conversation and lax habits, to the sins which the world has
   allowed and applauded? Jerusalem becomes a Comforter to Sodom when
   those who call themselves people of God conform to the usages of
   society--and of such society as is corrupt to the core! They say, "Ah,
   you see, there is no harm in it, for the saints, themselves, indulge in
   it! They are of the same mind as we are! They make a great pretence,
   but to no great purpose, for they do as we do." God forgive us if we
   have opened the mouths of the Lord's enemies after this fashion! Surely
   such failures and such offenses make it necessary for us to ask whether
   we love the Lord or not! And though we may hesitate to answer the
   question, it is well to raise it, lest, closing our eyes in carnal
   security, we should go on to destruction! Let us put the question to
   ourselves again, and again, and again, for the question will not mar
   our faith, nor even mar our comfort, as long as we are able to fall
   back upon Peter's reply, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I
   love You." And now, presuming that we are, all of us, convinced that
   the question is expedient and becoming, let me remark that--

   II. IT IS A QUESTION WHICH, WHEN RAISED, OFTEN CAUSES GRIEF.

   Peter was "grieved," but the Lord Jesus Christ never grieved one of His
   disciples heedlessly. This goes again to prove the need of the
   question. He was rather for comforting, cheering and blessing them. He
   inflicted no needless pain. He shielded them from bootless anxiety. Yet
   Peter was grieved. Now why should you and I be grieved when the enquiry
   turns upon our sincerity? You know that if we do not canvass the
   matter, ourselves, our foes will be prompt enough to suspect us,
   especially if we are in a public position. The clearer your character,
   the keener the assault. Satan--and he is the accuser of the
   brethren--said, "Does Job serve God for nothing? Have You not set a
   hedge about him?" The devil's taunting question has become a proverb
   with the profane! What worse can they say of the Christian minister
   than this, "Is he zealous for nothing? Has he not a motive? Is there
   not selfishness in the background?" Base insinuations will, I suppose,
   be freely uttered about you whatever may be your position in the world.
   Of the tradesman who fears the Lord, they will say, "Of course, he
   makes it pay." As for the merchant who consecrates his wealth for the
   love of Christ, they ask, "Do not you see that he is seeking notoriety?
   Is it not a cheap way of getting up a name?" We are sure to have the
   question raised. Sometimes it sorely grieves us because of our pride.

   We do not like to have our feelings chafed in such a manner. I cannot
   help thinking there was some sin in Peter's grief. He was grieved as
   one who felt himself aggrieved--"Is it not too bad to ask me three
   times! Why should the Lord thus distress me? Surely the blessed Master
   might have put more confidence in me than to press a question which
   stings like a reproach." Yet what a poor simpleton he was to think so!
   How much harm comes from answering in a hurry? When our profession is
   canvassed, we ought not to be angry. Did we know our own hearts, we
   would keenly feel the accusations it would be reasonable to lay against
   us--and the poor defense that conscience could make! When my enemies
   are finding fault with me, and forging lies to injure me, I sometimes
   think to myself that though I can exonerate myself from their charges,
   there are other faults of which they are not cognizant that humble me
   before God beyond their utmost surmise! Their conspiracies cannot
   explore the secret of my confessions when I lay the imaginations of my
   heart before Him against whom only I have sinned. How dare we whisper
   into the ears of our fellow men the wish, the whim the like, or the
   hate that haunts one's breast, or anything of the multitude of vanities
   that float along the rapid current of one's mind! What would they think
   of us who do not know how rightly to think of themselves? Surely pride
   is put out of countenance, for the worst opinions our enemies can form
   of us are probably as good as we dare to entertain of ourselves, taking
   the evil of our hearts into consideration! The heart is a very sink of
   evil! If we have not perceived it, we have yet to discover it. The
   voice Ezekiel heard speaks to us--"Son of man, I show you greater
   abominations than these." Little charm you can find, because little
   cheer you can get out of these sermons which wither your vain conceit!
   But they are not the less profitable. You prefer the small still voice
   of a kindly promise, or the rich tones of a glorious prophecy--and then
   you congratulate yourselves upon the happy Sabbath you have spent! I am
   not quite so sure that your emotions are the truest test of your
   interests. Is that always the most wholesome food your children get
   which has most sugar in it? Do they never get surfeited with luxury
   till they need medicine? Is comfort always the choicest blessing we can
   crave? Alas,

   we form so high an estimate of our estate, that to question whether we
   love the Lord Jesus Christ or not, lowers our dignity, annoys, vexes
   and sadly grieves us!

   Not that pride is the only incentive. Shame crouches full often in the
   same obscure cornerwhere pride nestles. Both alike are disturbed by a
   gleam of daylight. Peter must have felt, when he heard the question for
   the third time, "Do you love Me?" as if he could hear the cock grow
   again. He recollected the scene and circumstance of the dark betrayal
   hour. Does not the Lord remember my fear and my cowardice, the lies I
   told, the cursing and swearing I gave way to, and the paltry excuse
   that edged me on when the taunt of a poor silly maid was too much for
   an Apostle? Ah, she annoyed me, she irritated me, I was conquered. I
   became a traitor, a blasphemer, almost an apostate. The tears, the
   bitter tears he wept on the morning of the crucifixion when Jesus
   looked upon him, welled up again from his heart into his eyes as the
   risen Lord looked into his face and made him conscious of how richly he
   deserved to be asked the question, "Do you love Me?" Yes, and like
   bitter memories may cover some of us with shame! Bitter as gall must
   the recollections be to some of you who have so backslidden as to
   publicly dishonor Christ. I do not want to say an unkind thing to you,
   but it is good, sometimes, to keep a wound open. The Bible tells of
   some sins God has freely forgiven and yet fully recorded. It is no
   marvel if we cannot forgive ourselves for having in any way brought
   dishonor and reproach upon the Cross of Christ. The grief is healthy.
   We sing--

   "What anguish does that question stir, 'If you will also go?'"

   But what deeper anguish may that other question stir, "Do you love Me?"
   Our cheeks may well mantle with a crimson blush when we remember what
   grave cause for suspicion we have given to our Lord!

   Not that wounded pride and conscious shame are the only sensations.
   Perhaps fear distressed him. Peter may have thought to himself, Why
   does my Lord ask me three times? It may be I am deluded and that I do
   not love Him." Before his fall he would have said, "Lord, You know that
   I love You. How can You ask me? Have I not proved it? Did I not step
   down into the sea at Your beck and call? I will go through fire and
   water for You." But Simon, son of Jonas, had learned to be more sober
   and less loud in his protests. He had been tried. He had attempted to
   stand alone and he had proved his palpable weakness. He looks dubious,
   he seems hesitant, he feels scrupulous. He is alive to the fact that
   the Lord knows him better than he knows himself. Hence the diffidence
   with which he asserts his confidence--"You know all things; You know
   that I love You." A burned child is afraid of fire and a scalded child
   shudders at hot water. So a precocious Peter feels the peril of
   presumption. His timidity troubles him. He hesitates to give his word
   of honor. Distrust of self distresses him. He dreams his former
   downfall over and over again. The hypocrisy of his own heart horrifies
   him! What can he say? He answers the Accuser, or rather he appeals to
   the Appellant, "You know all things; You know that I love You." His
   previous guilt causes his present grief. Should like horrors haunt you,
   Friends, give no place to grievous misgivings! Do not encourage them.
   Go quickly to the Cross! Behold the crown of thorns! Fly at once, poor
   guilty Sinner, to the great Atonement which was made by the Lord upon
   the tree and let that fear be ended once and for all!

   Not that it was all pride, or all shame, or all fear--I think there was
   also love in it. Peter didlove his Master and, therefore, he did not
   like to have a doubt or a dark suspicion cast on his sincerity. Love is
   a very jealous emotion and keenly sensitive when questioned by those on
   whom it intensely dotes. "Why," Peter seems to say, "my Lord and
   Master, what would I not do for You? Though I was so false and so
   faithless in that hour of trial, yet I know that I am true in the very
   bottom of my heart. My fall has not been a total one, nor a final one.
   There is in my soul, my Lord, a true, deep and honest love to You--I
   know there is." He could not bear to have that love questioned. What
   would the wife say if her husband should ask, "Do you love me?" And if,
   after she had given a fond assurance of affection, he should repeat the
   question solemnly, and with an earnest and a penetrating
   look--especially if she had done much to grieve him and to make him
   suspect her--I ask, what would she say? Oh, I can understand how her
   love at last would make her heart feel as if it must burst! With what
   earnestness she would exclaim, "Oh, my husband, if you could see my
   heart, you would see your name written there!" It is hard, even in the
   conjugal relationship, to have a suspicion cast upon your affection!
   Because of the tenacity of his love, Peter was grieved. Had he not
   loved Christ so ardently, he would not have felt the grief so acutely.
   Had he been a hypocrite, he might have fired with anger, but he would
   not have grieved after this fashion. I tell some of our dear young
   people who get into trouble and say they are afraid that they are
   hypocrites, that I never yet knew a hypocrite who said he was afraid he
   was one, and those who say that they are afraid they do not love Jesus
   and are

   timid and trembling--though I do not commend them for their
   trembling--yet I have a much better hope of some of them than I have of
   others who are loud in their declarations and vehement in asserting,
   "Though all men forsake You, yet will not I." One is comforted to hear
   the confidence with which some of our young Brothers and Sisters can
   speak. Their warm expressions of love refresh us. Yet we cannot help
   feeling that they have got to be tried. Perhaps they will not be less
   confident in Christ when trial comes. They may be less confident in
   themselves and it is just possible that, though their voices may be
   quite as sweet, they will yet not be quite so loud. Years of trial and
   temptation--and especially any experience of backsliding--will pluck
   some of the feathers out of us and make us feel humble before the Lord.
   This grief of Peter, what a complex passion it was!

   III. BUT IF IT HAS GRIEVED US TO HEAR THIS QUESTION, IT WILL BE VERY
   SWEET IF WE CAN TRULY GIVE THE ANSWER, "YOU KNOW ALL THINGS; YOU KNOW
   THAT I LOVE YOU."

   Surely the preacher need not say any more if the hearers would just say
   what is in their own hearts. Let the question go round. With all your
   imperfections and infirmities, your wanderings and backslidings, can
   you nevertheless declare that you do love the Lord? Can you join in
   that verse--

   "You knowIlove You, dearest Lord, But, oh! I long to soar Far from the
   sphere of earthly joy, And learn to love You more"?

   If you can say that you love Christ from your very heart, how happy you
   ought to be! That love of yours is only a drop from the fountain of His
   own everlasting love. It is a proof that He loved you before He made
   the earth. It is also a pledge that He always will love you when the
   heavens and the earth shall pass away. "I am persuaded that neither
   death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers nor things
   present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
   creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in
   Christ Jesus our Lord." Jesus' hand is on you, or else your heart would
   not be on Him--and that hand will never relax its grip! He, Himself,
   has said it, "I give unto My sheep eternal life, and they shall never
   perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My hand." Now let your
   heart say, "What shall I do? What shall I render to Him whom I love?"
   And the Savior's answer to you will be," If you love Me, keep My
   commandments." You know His "commandments," as to the holiness of your
   life, the nonconformity of your spirit to the world, your private
   communion with Him. You know His commandment concerning your profession
   of your faith by Baptism. You know His commandment, "This do you in
   remembrance of Me," as often as you break bread and take the cup of
   fellowship. You know His commandment, "Feed My lambs; feed My sheep."
   Remember this--"If you love Me, keep My commandments."

   As for you who do not love my Lord and Master, what can I do but pray
   for you, that His great love may now overcome your ignorance and
   aversion--until, having first been loved of Him, you love Him in
   return? Jesus Christ would have you trust Him! Faith is the first Grace
   you need. Oh, come and depend upon Him who did hang upon the Cross!
   When you rest in Him, your soul is saved and, being saved, it shall
   become your constant joy to love Him who loved you and gave Himself for
   you! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN21.

   Verses 1-3. After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the
   disciples at the Sea of Tiberias; and on this wise showed He, Himself
   There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called the Twin, and
   Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee and two other
   ofHis disciples. Simon Peter said unto them, I am going fishing. They
   said to him, We are also going with you. They could not do better.
   Idleness is the most injurious condition in which a man can be found. A
   preacher is much better occupied fishing than doing nothing!

   3. They went forth, and immediately entered into a ship; and that night
   they caught nothing. Even Apostles may fish and catch nothing. Do not
   be discouraged, you who, when you are endeavoring to fish for souls,
   for many a day catch nothing.

   4. But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the
   disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Yet He was their old familiar
   Friend! Was it their unbelief? Let us hope not. Was it that a
   remarkable change had passed over

   the Master--that, after His Resurrection from the dead, there was a
   glory about Him quite unusual, such as they had never seen before,
   except when they were with Him on the holy mount? Perhaps so.

   5. Then Jesus said unto them, Children, have you any food?Just the kind
   of language you would expect from Him-- to call them children, and to
   inquire even about their temporal needs. For evermore the Lord had an
   eye to the temporal condition of the 12, as well as to their spiritual.
   "Have you any food?"

   5, 6. They answered Him, No. And He said unto them, Cast the net on the
   right side of the ship, and you will find some. They cast, therefore,
   and now they were not able to draw it in for the multitude of fishes.
   Christ knows where fishes are. He knows where you are, then, my Friend,
   though you do not, perhaps, know where you are yourself! You have got
   out of your own latitude, mentally and spiritually. You could not
   describe yourself, but Christ knows every minnow in the brook, and
   every fish in the lake, and knows where you are. Christ can bring fish
   where He wants them to be. He brought them into the net. Christ can
   bring souls into His net tonight. At His will, their will shall sweetly
   yield itself up, and they shall come into the net!

   7. Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter, It is the
   Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, heput on his
   fisher's coat, (for he was naked). He was in his undress.

   7, 8. And did cast himself into the sea. And the other disciples came
   in the little boat, (for they were not far from land, but as it were,
   two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish.It is all very well of
   Peter to be in such a hurry, but somebody must keep hold of the net. It
   is not always the most venturesome that is the most practical. We are
   glad to have some splendidly rash brethren, but we are equally glad
   that the rest are not quite so rash and are a little more prudent.

   9. As soon, then, as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals
   there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. Christ had provided this. We
   are to catch fish as if we should have nothing to eat if we did not,
   but yet we are to depend upon Him as if we never caught a fish
   ourselves. Do everything as if you had to do everything--but trust in
   God as if you had to do nothing! The blending of these two will make a
   wise Believer. "They saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon,
   and bread."

   10. Jesus said unto them, Bring some of the fish which you have just
   caught. "I do not need it in order to entertain you, for I already have
   fish here. Still, bring it." Nothing is given in vain. Use it.

   11. 12. Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great
   fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many,
   yet was not the net broken. And Jesus said unto them, Come and dine.
   And none of the disciples dared ask Him, Who are You? Knowing that it
   was the Lord. Inwardly conscious that it was Christ's habit to speak as
   He had spoken. Nobody could have caught His manner, and besides, what
   secret instinct enabled them to discern their meek and lowly Lord, even
   through the Glory which surrounded Him?

   13, 14. Jesus then came and took the bread, and gave it to them and
   likewise the fish. This is now the third time that Jesus showed Himself
   to His disciples after He was raised from the dead. Count the visits of
   Christ. "This is now the third time." We ought to remember Christ's
   visits to us so well and so thoroughly that we could tell how many
   times He has been with us. "This is now the third time."

   15-17. So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of
   Jonas, Do you love Me more than these? He said unto Him, Yes, Lord, You
   know that I love You. He said unto him, Feed My lambs. He said to him,
   again, the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, Do you love Me? He said
   unto Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said unto him, feed
   My sheep. He said unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, Do you
   love Me? Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, Do
   you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know
   that I love You. Jesus said unto him, Feed My sheep.Nobody can feed
   Christ's sheep unless they love Him, and when we love Christ, the most
   practical way of showing it is by taking care of His lambs--His little
   ones--and of all those that are His--His sheep. Love will teach us how
   to do it. Love will sign our commission and ordain us to the work. The
   Master went on to say--

   18. Verily, verily, I say unto you, When you were young, you girded
   yourself and walked where you wished; but when you shall be old, they
   shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry
   you where you would not. Peter, you will have to be girded with an iron
   chain and taken off to prison--and taken off to a cross to die!

   19. This spoke He, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And
   when He had spoken this, He said unto him, Follow Me. That is your life
   business. Follow Me, even though you end, as I did, on a cross. Follow
   Me. I am a Shepherd. You must be a shepherd, too, and as the sheep
   follow you, so do you follow Me.

   20, 21. Then Peter, turning about, seeing the disciple whom Jesus loved
   following; who also leaned on His breast at

   supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrays You? Peter seeing him,
   said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? What about this man?

   22. Jesus said unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
   that to you? Follow Me.We ought not to be curious about the future of
   anybody. We must not be inquiring into what is not revealed! And what
   the Savior said on this occasion was misunderstood--if the words of
   Jesus, even when He spoke them--were misunderstood so as to become the
   foundation of a false tradition, you may judge how little value can
   ever be put upon tradition in the Church!

   23. Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple
   should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, he shall not die, but if I
   will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you?The Word of God is
   to be trusted--not tradi-tion--for in the handing of a message from
   mouth to mouth, it generally varies. It sometimes loses its very
   essential spirit, and sometimes may be made to say the very reverse of
   what was said. Stick to the Word of God--and leave the traditions
   alone!

   24. 25. This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote
   these things: and we know that his testimony is true. And there are
   also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be
   written, every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not
   contain the books that should be written. Amen. Such a full life--so
   pregnant with meaning--so active, and all its activity so intensely
   real and spiritual, that to write a life of Christ is an impossibility!
   And though there have been many very admirable "lives of Christ" in our
   time, I recommend you to keep to one which is the best of them all--and
   that one is written by four Inspired authors--the Gospels according to
   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are the best life of Christ out of sight!
   All others must be but mere helps to the understanding of these four.

God's Overtaking Mercy

   (No. 3525)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 17, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S DAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 22, 1871.

   "And He [the Angel of the Lord] said, Hagar, Sarah's maid, where have
   you come from? And where will you go? And she said, I flee from the
   face of my mistress Sarah." Genesis 16:8.

   "And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her,
   You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees, for she said, Have I also here seen Him who
   sees me?" Genesis 16:13.

   HAGAR had lived for many years in Abraham's family. This was no small
   advantage. While all the rest of the world was in heathendom, the Light
   of God shone brightly in Abraham's tent. Not only was Abraham, himself,
   a worshipper of the Most High God, but he commanded his household after
   him. We may rest assured that there were family gatherings for
   devotion--that the Patriarch took occasion, both by precept and
   example, to teach the knowledge of the true God to all who were in his
   service. His was the central spot of the Light of God in the world--and
   all around him was the thick gloom of heathenism. Yet I do not find
   that Hager, during the years she lived with Abraham, even when she saw
   his faith in going forth from his kindred and his country, and dwelling
   in tents in the promised land--I do not find that she, herself,
   received any personal call from God, or had a word from the Angel of
   Mercy to her own soul. And truly in this she is like very many
   servants, yes, and sons and daughters, too, in godly families who are
   surrounded by the Light of God, but yet see not--who are where God
   speaks--and yet He has not spoken personally to them. Who enjoy the
   means of Grace, but have never yet got the Grace of the means--who are
   themselves strangers in the midst of Israel, foreigners, though they
   dwell in the land, itself! Now it would be a source of the greatest
   imaginable joy to many of us if some of these should be called as Hagar
   was--should hear the voice from Heaven and be enabled to make the
   double discovery which she made, namely, that God saw her, and that she
   might come into contact with God--might look to Him who had seen her!

   At this time I shall first direct your attention to a very interesting
   circumstance, namely-- I. THE SINGULAR SEASON CHOSEN BY GOD FOR THE
   INTERPOSITION OF HIS MERCY. Let us dwell on that a moment. God displays
   His Sovereignty in saving souls, both in the souls whom He chooses to
   save, in the instrumentality He uses in calling them, and in the
   conditions of mind in which He finds them when He is pleased to look
   upon them in mercy.

   Now Hagar at that time--at the time when the Angel called to her seemed
   to be in somewhat an unlikely state to be visited of God. She was,
   first of all, at that moment smarting under a sense of wrong. She felt
   that Sarah had not treated her well and in all probability Sarah had
   not. The Eastern mistress is often very tyrannical towards her
   servants, and Hagar stood very much in the position of a slave. We do
   not doubt but what the jealous wife had been very severe--unjustly
   severe towards the woman. There she sat by the well, feeling bitterness
   in her own soul, that in the house of good people where she had
   expected better things, she had been treated with injustice. It did not
   seem likely that the God of Abraham would call her when her heart was
   seething like a pot with indignation against the household where God
   was worshipped! At the same time, as she turned the matter over and her
   soul grew more and more bitter within her, I should not wonder but what
   she felt she had brought a good deal of it upon herself. She was but
   the servant and she had desired to play the mistress. She had despised
   the mistress--no doubt spoken to her very contemptuously--and now it
   had returned upon her and she was made to suffer for her own pride. Her
   proud, fierce spirit, perhaps, did not admit it, but yet she must have
   felt in her conscience that much of what was wrong about her she had,
   notwithstanding, brought upon

   herself. Now when a person is under such a feeling as that, disturbed,
   tossed to and fro, vexed, distracted--it does not seem a likely time
   for them to hear the voice of God speaking to their souls!

   Moreover, at that moment she was leaving all that was good. She had
   turned her back upon the household, the chosen household--left it, I
   will not say deliberately, but at any rate she had left it. She was
   going down into Egypt--going "anywhere, anywhere out of the world," so
   that she could but get away from the place where her bondage had become
   irksome. She was going, she scarcely knew where, but she probably did
   know that she was going into heathendom, among heathen people. The best
   she could hope to meet with was separation from God. She could not but
   feel that it was black darkness which was before her and she was
   rushing madly into it because her high spirit would not bend--would not
   bow--would not yield before the majesty of the Most High. I think I see
   her there, her eyes red with weeping, her spirit broken down with the
   hunger of her journey, sitting a while and refreshed a moment, and
   resolved not to stoop and never to go back--and then, again, shuddering
   at the darkness that lay before her and afraid to go on. It was in such
   a state as that that God met with her! To all intents and purposes she
   was a friendless, outcast woman. She had left the only tents where she
   could claim a shelter. She had gone into the wilderness--no father, no
   mother, no brother, no sister to care for her. She turned her back upon
   those who had any interest in her and now she was left alone--alone,
   alone in a desert land without an eye to pity or a hand to help! It was
   then, under those peculiar circumstances of trial and of sin
   commingled, that God met with her!

   I have been wondering in my soul, when I turned over this text, whether
   there would stray into this Tabernacle some kindred case, and whether,
   though no angel spoke, yet the voice of man might be tonight the voice
   of the Messenger of the Covenant to some poor soul? I know you not by
   name, nor face, yet I know well your feelings! It may be tonight you
   are sorely angry, greatly vexed, smarting, wrathful! You have made up
   your mind to choose the world and give up every semblance of that which
   is good. It may be tonight that you have lost everything that makes
   earth worth living in. You long for death--you would almost seek the
   place where the lamps quiver on the dark river, for your spirit is
   bitterness, itself, your lamp of hope is gone out! Oh, but it may be
   that this is the night when God's mighty mercy is ordained to meet with
   you--the very evening in which the Lord shall call out your name and
   you shall feel that He knows you, your case, your circumstances and
   that He has come to call you to Himself and you never might have been
   called had not these extremities of yours brought God to your rescue
   and to your salvation! I do not suppose that there will be anyone whose
   case exactly resembles that of the text, but it has sometimes happened
   that the turning point of human life has been the point of great
   sorrow, great penury and distress of mind on account of some gigantic
   fault, or it has been the time of some dreadful alternative put before
   the soul in which it seemed as though it must be God or devil that
   night--Heaven or Hell that night--eternal joy or eternal misery that
   night! On some such strange occasion as this in your mental history you
   have come here tonight--may God, who is here, speak with you! A
   singular season for mercy! Now, secondly, let us look at--

   II. THE MODE OF MERCY, OR THE HOME QUESTIONS WHICH THE ANGEL PUT TO
   HER.

   She is sitting there by the well. It is in a desert. It may be a little
   oasis on the road, but there is no one within sight, nor any
   probability of any caravan passing that way. As she sits quite still,
   she hears a voice, "Hagar." She starts, she looks up and there is a
   brightness like the sun above her--it shines brighter than the sun at
   noonday! She can scarcely bear the light, and she hears it again,
   "Hagar, Sarah's maid." Whoever it is that is speaking knows who she is,
   and what she is, and all about her. "Where have you come from? And
   where will you go?" She is so startled--she has just been thinking of
   the place from where she came--and that dismal question had just been
   starting her mind. "Where will you go?" She felt that there was no
   place for her to go. It was only a choice of equal horror--she knew not
   where to go. Now remark this, that very often the Gospel call comes to
   the sons of men not by a voice heard by the ear, but through the
   ministry in the way of describing the person's case with minute
   accuracy. It was the Savior's way of doing it when He was on earth. The
   woman was by the well. The Savior spoke to her. The words did not seem
   to take effect. He turned the subject, and He said, "Go, call your
   husband and come here." "I have no husband," she said. If she could
   blush, she blushed then--"I have no husband." "You have said well, 'I
   have no husband,' for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now
   have is not your husband. In that you said truly." Then the shock went
   to her very heart! She perceived that He who spoke was something more
   than man. And when the Gospel fully preached describes the sinner,
   paints him, photographs him, holds it before him and makes him say,
   "Why, that is me--he speaks of me--it is even me," then it is that the
   soul perceives what Hagar perceived--that God saw her--and that she
   might look to God!

   Now I shall not endeavor to make any picture of you, dear Hearer. If I
   were to try it, I could not do it--it is only the Lord, Himself, who
   guides us in such matters. But I will put the question to you, "Where
   have you come from?" Did you

   come into the condition in which you now are out of a godly parentage?
   Have you got into London sin, but was there a time when you once knelt
   at your mother's knee at eventide and repeated a gracious prayer? Ah,
   you have spent many a day and many a night in the haunts of sin! You
   were once a teacher in the Sabbath school--once a lover of the Gospel
   (at least professedly so) which now you turn from and abhor! "Where
   have you come from?" From old impressions that have been forgotten?
   From an old profession that has been disgraced? Were you once
   honorable, but now dishonorable-- once a servant of God, but now a
   servant at the devil's altar--a ringleader in sin it may be, though
   once you were at Heaven's own gates? "Where have you come from?"
   Remember from where you have fallen, and repent! And "where will you
   go?" Oh, let me put the question! You stand tonight just here, "Where
   will you go?" Another sin tempts you tonight--will you commit it? I
   would gladly stand with you, as the old Scythian did of old when his
   country was about to be invaded by the foe. He drew a line before the
   chieftain of the invading host, and said, "Cross that line, and there
   is war forever! Stay there and there may be peace." I put a line before
   your steps tonight! In the name of the everlasting God, I charge you
   cease from that sin! Once more commit it and it may be that no mercy's
   trumpet shall ever sound out a message of forgiveness to you again!
   "Where will you go?" Oh, go not like a dog to your vomit, like the sow
   that was washed to her wallowing! Go no further, for "where will you
   go" in the future? A man who sins today will sin worse tomorrow, and
   the next day even worse. Many a young man, when he has commenced with
   what are called the follies of London life, had no idea that he would
   end it debauched, depraved and abandoned! Many a woman, when she has
   once begun to trifle with sin, had no idea that her name would be
   coupled one day with infamy! Many a young man at his master's till is
   scrupulously honest, today, and never dreams that he will one day be a
   thief--yet he is about to take a step that will surely make him so--the
   first step to evil!

   Oh, "where will you go?" I believe that many a man, many a woman, if
   they could go back 20 years and be young people, again, and have their
   history written, the true history as they lived it, would say, "I never
   shall live so. Is your servant a dog that he should do this thing?"
   They would have been indignant at the supposition that they could ever
   be capable of the transgression into which they have now actually
   fallen! "Where will you go?" Stop! Stop! You who are marching on to
   evil, stop! In the name of Him that lives, stop, lest you march to
   damnation and take one step that shall be your inevitable ruin, for
   this is the worst of it! "Where will you go?" The way of sin is the way
   of destruction! Men cannot sin and be happy. The end, the end, the end,
   the end of it, oh, think of it! It is not today, nor tomorrow, but it
   is that dying hour--no, it is not that only--it is that hour when, up
   from among the dead, you shall arise amidst the ringing of the Last
   Judgment trumpet! It is that opening of the books, that reading of the
   several dooms--that separation of the righteous from the wicked--it is
   that which hangs upon this question, "Where will you go?" Oh, go not to
   the Judgment unforgiven! Go not to the Judgment to be condemned, to be
   cast into the place "where their worm dies not, and their fire is not
   quenched." God save you, Sinner! May He save you tonight instrumentally
   by the force of those two questions--"Where have you come from? Where
   will you go?"

   And now let us notice, attentively, having observed the remarkable
   season and the home questions, let us notice attentively--

   III. THE DISCOVERY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.

   The description had been so accurate--"Hagar, Sarah's maid." The
   questions had been so pertinent, had stuck so close to her soul--"Where
   have you come from? And where will you go?" that she said, "It is God,
   it is God that speaks to me." And there came home to her what she had
   often heard before, but never felt. "There is a God. God is not an
   impalpable somebody up there who has nothing to do with me, but there
   is God here, here, and He sees me! It is God that deals with me--not
   far away, asleep, or blind, but God sees me!" Oh, it is a glorious
   thing when a soul starts up to that conviction, "I am not alone, I am
   not friendless, after all. There is a God and a God who sees me and who
   takes such notice of note that He speaks to me." A man is never saved
   until he gets to feel something of the nearness of God, God in Christ
   Jesus, but yet God. Consciousness of Deity is one of the marks of
   salvation. Now Hagar's thoughts must have been something like this.
   "After all, there is Somebody that has seen me and marked all my past
   life, though I did not see Him. He knows everything that I have done or
   thought, or said, and I perceive now that He has spoken to me, that He
   cares about me. I thought Abraham did not care for me, Sarah was angry,
   and then I said, 'No man cares for my soul, and I will go away.' Now I
   see that God was watching me and He has cared about me, and though He
   did not interpose to help me just then, just when I was so bitterly
   oppressed, yet I know He has cared for me, for at last, when I was
   sitting on this well, alone, He spoke to my soul." Sinner, I pray the
   Holy Spirit to make just this discovery to you, that, after all, God
   does care about you! He who made the heavens and the earth does think
   of you! Though you are little, and less than nothing as compared with
   the bulk of His vast Creation, yet on you He sets His eyes, for you He
   has a care!

   "Well," Hagar said in her soul, "seeing that He cares for me, He will
   interpose on my behalf." The Angel, who spoke, spoke words of comfort
   to her heart--told her that there was a happier future in store for her
   than she dreamed--sent her away with a comfortable word ringing in her
   ears! Oh, Soul, I pray God to do that for you tonight! You have said,
   "God has forgotten me." He knows all about you. It may be this is the
   Truth of God--I hope it is--that your name is written on the palms of
   Jesus' hands! What if it should turn out that you, rebellious sinner
   that you are, are one whom God loved before the foundation of the
   world? What if you are one of His chosen, whom the Savior bought with
   His blood? What if you are one who shall surely sit in Heaven, wear the
   white robe and sing the new song--what if you are a favored one of the
   Most High? Oh, I think I hear you say, "If I had half a thought that
   that was true, I would not lie down in despair--I would up and bestir
   myself and I would have done with my old companions! I would have done
   with my old sins, if that were true!" Oh, Soul, I cannot tell you that
   it is true--I hope it is--but I can tell you one thing that is true,
   namely, that if you will now come and put your trust in Jesus Christ,
   and repent of your iniquities, then it is all true! I can only know
   your election by your calling! I can only tell your calling by your
   repentance and by your faith! And if you should find peace, tonight,
   and I pray you may, then you are God's beloved! He who made the heavens
   loves you! He who made the earth bought you with His blood and Heaven
   would not be complete without you! What if you have been far off by
   wicked works, yet still you are a child and Heaven shall yet ring with
   music on your return! What if you have been lost in the filth of
   drunkenness and all manner of lasciviousness, yet still a piece of
   God's precious silver, the house shall be swept for you and the candle
   lit, and you shall yet be found and put into the Savior's treasury! Oh,
   what hope this ought to make well up in the poor hopeless sinner's
   heart! It is not because of your goodness, but because of His Infinite
   goodness that He comes to meet with you, unworthy as you are, for He
   sees you--He sees you--with thoughts of love He sees you and tonight He
   interposes as He calls you by your name!

   Now when Hagar made that discovery, she made another at the same time.
   She said, "Have I also here seen Him who sees me?"--as much as to say,
   and probably she had not known it before, that as God could come to
   her, so she could go to God. "God has looked after me, and now I can
   look after Him." There is not a great gulf between the creature and the
   Creator. We can send messages to Heaven and receive blessings from
   Heaven. She felt from that moment that God was real, living,
   appreciable and that God would hear her prayers and answer her
   petitions--and had really and literally spoken to her. Oh, I do not
   know anything that puts such strength into a man, such encouragement,
   such joy makes him so patient as the belief that God has spoken to
   him--that God has spoken in words of love and promise to him! Why, from
   that day poor Hagar would say, "I will go back. I will go back. The God
   of Abraham has spoken to me. Abraham may be unkind, but I will bear it,
   for Abraham's God has spoken to me. Sarah may be more cross than
   ever--never mind, I do not know that I can tell her of it, but oh, it
   will be such a joy in my soul--God has spoken to me, assured me of His
   favor, given me a blessing!" Now that young man who thinks he has been
   so badly treated, if he gets his sins pardoned tonight, and the Lord
   speaks with him, he will go back and say, "I daresay I was as much to
   blame as anybody, but, whether or not, I am saved and I can now put up
   with anything!" And that man who is so poor that he would hardly dare
   come even into this Tabernacle because his clothes were so shabby, and
   he was ready to say, "I will give up the battle of life. I will never
   try again"--oh, if he were able to say, "I know that God has spoken
   with me tonight, brought me to the Savior's feet and blotted out my
   sin"--oh! dear Brother, you will pick up the weapons, again, and go to
   the battle of life once more, and your poverty will seem to have lost
   its edge! The bitterness will have departed! The iron will not enter
   into your soul! Get a word from God and know that you are His child,
   and you can say, "Now blow, you winds, rage, you waves, and all you
   elements let forth your fury--the God that rules you all is now my
   Friend! No hurt can you do to

   me!"

   If you notice, it was just so with Hagar when she had heard the voice
   of the Lord and perceived that God saw her and that she could speak to
   God--then at once she went back. Told to go back, back she
   went--submitted herself. You don't find her again personally--though
   the old blood came up afterwards in her son--you don't find her
   quarrelling with her mistress, but she patiently bears her lot in the
   recollection of the blessing that she had received. This is just the
   way with men, willful, wayward, headstrong--but when they get the Grace
   of God, they bend their shoulders to Christ's yoke and they become tame
   and gentle. Because they are happy in God's love, they are patient in
   the ills of this life. Remember the story of the poor raving maniac.
   They had often bound him with chains, but he snapped them asunder. He
   had left his family and gone to dwell among the tombs. He made night
   hideous with his screams and howls. Men dared not pass that way, for he
   was worse than a wild beast! He had cut himself and torn his flesh,
   torn himself with stones and briars--none could tame him! But after
   Jesus had said to the evil spirit, "I charge you that you come out of
   him," we find him clothed, which he had not been for many a day, in his
   right mind and sitting at the feet of Jesus! Oh, if some wild

   spirit is here now, some spirit driven to it by suffering, by neglect,
   by injustice from others--and also by its own personal sin--if the Lord
   brings you to trust in Jesus, His dear Son, and see your sin all laid
   upon Him, then you will, even at this moment, be a different man! Your
   wife will scarcely know you, nor your children, either! You will become
   another than you have ever been before. You will go back to your
   business, back to your burdens, back to your sufferings and bear them
   all for the sake of Him that spoke out of Heaven and saved your soul!

   Now the most of this I daresay is not applicable to the most of you.
   You know I have been thinking, while preaching, that you might say I
   had not been preaching except to some one or two that were here. Well,
   I will tell you my excuse. "What man of you, if he has an hundred
   sheep, if he loses one, does not leave the ninety and nine, and go
   after that which is gone astray?" After that "gone-astray one" I have
   gone! And my Master, too! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 1 CORINTHIANS 13; EPHESIANS1.

   1 CORINTHIANS 13

   Verse 1. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have
   not charity, I have become as a sounding brass, or a tinkling symbol If
   there is no love to God, and no love to man, the vital element is
   lacking. Whatever sound we make, if the Word of God is not in us, it is
   a sound that has no meaning, conveys no heavenly meaning. "I have
   become as a sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal." What if any of us
   who bears witness for Christ with our tongues should be found to be no
   better than this?

   2. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all
   mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I
   could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. Judas had,
   no doubt, faith in God's miracles, but yet he was not saved.
   Selfishness was his ruling motive--he had no love to God or man. How
   this clips the wings of those lofty ones who hover on high, boasting of
   their knowledge and of their gifts! There are many who have few
   gifts--obscure and unknown, but love God much--these are the accepted
   ones! Before God the balances of the sanctuary are rather turned by the
   shekel of love than by any weight of talent or position.

   3. And though Ibestow allmy goods to feed thepoor, and though Igive my
   body to be burned, andhave not charity, it profits me nothing. Love is
   a matter of the heart, and if the heart is not right with God, external
   acts, though they are very similar to the highest acts that flow from
   love, are of no service! God requires the heart to be right, and if
   that is not right, whatever comes out of us is not acceptable in His
   sight.

   4. 5. Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity
   vaunts not itself, is not puffed up. Does not behave itself unseemly,
   seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil Always try to
   put the best construction on other people's actions and work. Let
   gentleness triumph.

   6-11. Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth. Bears all
   things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
   Charity never fails: but where there are prophecies, they shall fail;
   where there are tongues, they shall cease; where there is knowledge, it
   shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part But
   when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
   done a way with. When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood
   as a child, I thought as a child: but when I become a man, I put away
   childish things. Much of what we call knowledge, much of what we call
   eloquence, will all be put away. As our spiritual growth shall
   increase, we shall not need these childish things.

   12, 13. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then, face to face:
   now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And
   now abides faith, hope, charity, these three. Three abiding Graces.
   Some have said that faith and hope will not be found in Heaven. Why
   not? Why not? It seems to me there will be plenty of room for them--
   plenty of space for them. Am I to be an unbeliever when I get to
   Heaven? Am I not to believe when my disembodied spirit goes to Heaven?
   Am I not to believe in the resurrection of the dead? Am I not hopefully
   to expect it? Am I not in Heaven to believe in the Second Advent of
   Christ? Am I not to be hoping for it? Am I not to believe in the
   complete conquest of Christ, and that He shall reign from the river,
   even to the ends of the earth? And am I not to hope for it? To miss
   faith and hope in Heaven were to miss two things which the Apostle
   expressly tells us are the abiding things!

   13. But the greatest of these is charity. It is the highest, the
   pinnacle. It is not the foundation--that is faith. Just as a rose in
   full bloom is greater than the stem that bears it, so, while faith is
   most necessary, and hope most cheering, love is the most beautiful and
   brightest of the three!

   EPHESIANS 1.

   Verse 1. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God. He was
   not made an Apostle by man, neither did he take the office upon
   himself, but he was made an Apostle by the will of God.

   1. To the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ
   Jesus. The saints in Ephesus, the saints where they cried, "Great is
   Diana of the Ephesians," had to bear an earnest witness against
   idolatry. And, dear Friends, today saints in London will not have a
   very easy time of it if they are faithful to their Lord, for there is
   much to protest against in this evil generation! But as there were holy
   ones in Ephesus, God grant that there may be many such in London!

   2. Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord
   Jesus Christ. Paul would have us peaceful, restful, quiet. That peace
   must be based upon Divine Grace--he does not pray that we may have
   peace apart from Grace, but, "Grace be to you, and peace."

   3, 4. Blessed be the God andFather ofour Lord Jesus Christ, who has
   blessed us with allspiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:
   According as He has chosen us in Him before the foundation of the
   world. The high mystery of Election is taught in the Word of God, but
   some are afraid to speak of it. Not so our Apostle! He brings it out
   very clearly and distinctly, and so should we, only taking care to keep
   it in the proportion of other Doctrines.

   4, 5. That we should be holy and without blame before Him in love.
   Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
   to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will. You hear much
   about the free will of man. Hear a little about the free will of God!
   You would think, from the talk of some, that God was man's debtor and
   must do according to the will of man. But it is not so. He is a
   Sovereign, and gives His Grace to whom He chooses, and He would have us
   know that it is according to the good pleasure of His will.

   6. To the praise of the glory of His Grace, wherein He has made us
   accepted in the Beloved. Are there four words in any language which
   contain choicer meaning than these, "Accepted in the Beloved"? Oh, if
   you can say that, if you can feel it to be true, you are among the
   happiest of men and women! "Accepted in the Beloved." You can never be
   accepted apart from Christ, the Father's best Beloved. But there is
   merit enough in Him to overflow and cover all our sins, and we are
   accepted in the Beloved.

   7. In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of
   sins, according to the riches ofHis Grace. Notice how the Apostle keeps
   on insisting that we have everything in Christ. He says, times out of
   number, "in Him," "in Christ." We have redemption. We are free. We are
   no longer under bonds. What is the price? "Through His blood." What is
   the result? "Forgiveness of sins." What is the measure of our liberty?
   "According to the riches of His Grace."

   8. Wherein He has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence. Not
   drowning us with floods of His Grace, but handing it out to us as we
   are able to take it. The riches of His Grace we have, but He uses
   wisdom and prudence, teaching us little by little as we are able to
   bear it, and raising us up by degrees from one stage of Grace to
   another, according as our poor frames can endure the joy!

   9. 10. Having made known unto us the mystery ofHis will, according to
   His good pleasure which He has purposed in Himself: That in the
   dispensation of the fullness of times He might gather together in one
   all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth;
   even in Him. There are things in Christ in Heaven. There are things in
   Christ on earth. But all the things in Christ shall be gathered
   together. All the redeemed shall come as one great host to bow before
   the Throne of the Infinite Majesty.

   11. In whom also--Notice those words.

   11. We have obtained an inheritance. We have got the inheritance. Even
   now we have entered upon possession of the Kingdom of Grace.

   11, 12. Being predestinated according to the purpose of Him who works
   all things after the counsel ofHis own will; That we should be to the
   praise ofHis glory, who first trusted in Christ. The first saints led
   the way in the front of the army, and they are to the praise of God's
   Glory to this day. We thank God for the Apostles and martyrs who went
   before us. We will follow them as they followed Christ.

   13. In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth,
   the Gospel ofour salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you
   were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise. After faith, the Holy
   Spirit is given to dwell in the soul. That is the seal. It is not that
   the Holy Spirit brings a seal with Him. He is the Seal. Where He
   dwells, He is the seal of God's love to that man.

   14. Which is the earnest ofour inheritance until the redemption of the
   purchased possession, unto the praise ofHis glory. The Holy Spirit is
   first, the seal, and next, the earnest. We all know what an earnest is.
   It is different from a pledge. A pledge is given and then it is taken
   back again when the stipulation is carried out. But an earnest is part
   of

   what is to be ultimately received. The man who receives an earnest of
   his wage gets a few shillings, say, on Thursday, instead of taking all
   on Saturday. He never returns that. It is a part of his wages. And so
   the Holy Spirit is a part of him. When we have got Him, we have got
   Christ--

   "You are the earnest of His love,

   The pledge of joys to come;

   And Your soft wings, Celestial Dove,

   Shall safely convey me home." 15, 16. Therefore I, also, after I heard
   of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints, cease
   not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers. Is
   that the way that we pray? Do we make mention of people in our prayers?
   It is well to do so! It is a good plan to keep a list of persons for
   whom we ought to pray and to put it before us when we draw near to God,
   and go over the names. I know one man of God who has kept a debtor and
   creditor list with God for many years. He puts his requests down in the
   book, and when they are answered he puts that down, and if they are not
   answered, he repeats them. It is a very wonderful book. I think that he
   told me that there is a name down there of a person for whom he has
   prayed, who is not converted yet, and that out of several for whom he
   began to pray, he is the only one who is not converted--and that he is
   the only one that is alive! The others were brought to Christ and died
   in the faith, but he, not yet brought to Christ, still lives--and my
   friend prays on with as great a confidence of the conversion of that
   man as I have that Christmas will come in due time! I wish that we did
   business with God in some such fashion as that, but our prayers are
   shadowy, unreal. God teach us how to pray!

   17, 18. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may
   give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
   Him: The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may
   know what is the hope of His calling. You see he gave thanks to God for
   their faith and for their love. But there are three Divine sisters that
   must never be separated--faith, hope, and love, and so the Apostle
   prays, "that you may know what is the hope of His calling."

   18-21. And what the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the
   saints. And what is the exceeding greatness of His power to us who
   believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked
   in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead, andset Him at His right
   hand in the heavenly places. Far above all principality, andpower,
   andmight, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this
   world, but also in that which is to come. See how high Christ is
   raised! The same power that brought Christ from the dead and set Him on
   high, works in the salvation of every Believer! Nothing less than
   Omnipotence can save a soul--and Omnipotence at its very best in the
   glorification of Christ is none too great for the salvation of a
   sinner!

   22, 23. Andhasput all things under His feet, andgave Him to be the Head
   over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him
   that fills all-in-all May God bless to us the reading of that Chapter.

The New Wine of the Kingdom

   (No. 3526)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 24, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day
   when I drink it new with you in My Father's Kingdom." Matthew 26:29.

   SUCH words could hardly have been spoken at such a time by our Lord
   Jesus Christ without some deep significance. Let us, then, reverently
   enquire into their meaning. What thoughts were those that stirred in
   His own breast? What lessons did He convey to His beloved disciples?
   And, first, does not our Lord here express--

   I. HIS RENUNCIATION FROM THAT MOMENT OF ALL THE JOYS AND COMFORTS OF
   LIFE?

   Putting aside the cup that was filled with the juice of the vine, He
   said, "I shall henceforth no more drink of this fruit of the vine."
   Here He bids farewell to social cheer. Whatever little comforts He had
   enjoyed were now to be quitted. He had never been rich--full often He
   had not where to lay His head. His clothing had always been that of a
   simple peasant--"a garment without seam" had sufficed for Him. Scanty
   the rest He had ever known. Little luxury He had ever enjoyed, but now
   He does, as it were, solemnly relinquish every creature gratification,
   "I will henceforth no more drink of fruit of the vine." Not as One who
   had been satiated with the comforts or surfeited with the pleasures of
   life did our Lord and Master speak. It is no uncommon thing for the
   pleasure seekers of the world to feel the strongest aversion to the
   indulgences for which they once had the keenest relish. The world's joy
   sours, its sweet honey sickens on the palate, its most fascinating
   entertainments, by constant repetition, pall the faculty of enjoying
   them! Our Savior had encountered life in its sterner moods. His main
   aim was to discharge its duties, not to divert Himself with its
   amenities. Nor did He put aside that cup out of any ostentation, as
   though He affected a stoical indifference. We all know that refreshment
   is needed to recruit the energies of the laborer or the sufferer.
   Nothing could be less in keeping with our Lord's disposition than a
   gloomy asceticism. Yet He willingly now, before His disciples,
   renounces all that there was of this world's good. Taking, then, this
   wine cup as a symbol, and understanding it to represent earthly cheer,
   we observe how significantly He puts it aside--He will partake of it no
   more! We ask the reason why in the presence of so strong a
   determination, so clear a prediction.

   But before I attempt to answer the question, let me remind you that
   there are occasions in the Christian life when a man is bound to give
   up all his comforts for Christ's sake. It is by no means impossible or
   improbable that honest principle and sterling integrity may demand of
   you or me a total surrender of everything which we have been accustomed
   to hold dear. A sincere Christian must maintain his conscience, even if
   he can scarcely maintain himself. He must come down from the broadcloth
   to the fustian, from the mansion to the cottage, from riding in his
   carriage to trudging on foot. Our fathers did it and they did it on
   principle--they did it for Christ's sake. The martyrs did more--they
   laid down their lives upon the altar when Christ's cause demanded it.
   The like times may come back to us again. In the competition of the
   unscrupulous, the righteous must suffer. Business is rotten through and
   through, nowadays. The whole style of conducting your merchandise is so
   doubly dyed in deceit, that I should not marvel if a Christian often
   finds himself a loser by doing the right thing and maintaining a strict
   integrity! But we must sooner be losers in this way than lose our
   acceptance with God! We must be willing to sink in the world's esteem
   and be counted fools for Christ's sake, rather than amass riches and
   rise to a position of commercial influence through any equivocal
   dealings or any sort of duplicity! We must keep our consciences from
   being soiled with the wiles and stratagems of those whose ingenuity is
   always directed to the promotion of bubble companies, or the practice
   of some disingenuous finesse whereby they lie in wait to deceive the
   unwary. Refrain yourselves from every false way! But do not vaunt your
   own purity or be ostentatious of your own vir-

   tue, as if you were better than others. Above all things, do not make a
   cross for yourselves and then put it on your own back and act the
   martyr! But when you must take up your cross for your Master's sake, do
   it as He did--with fidelity, yet with meekness--and say, "I will no
   more drink of this fruit of the vine. I will no more seek the esteem of
   my fellows. I will no more cultivate the world's friendship. I will no
   more foster the affection of those who once loved me in my sins. I will
   give up anything--I will give up everything--I will give up life,
   itself, if necessary, that I may glorify God as my Lord and Master
   did."

   Now why did our Lord thus say, "I will no more drink of this fruit of
   the vine"? It was because now He had other work to do. He must,
   therefore, forego all that would stand in the way of His accomplishing
   it. He had to sweat the bloody sweat! He had to stand accused before
   Pilate and Herod! He had to bear His Cross through Jerusalem's
   malicious crowds! He had to give His hands to the nails, and His feet
   to the cruel iron. These were no times for thinking of comforts. And
   the cause of the Master may sometimes make the same demands upon us.
   The man who will devote himself to the mission field must be willing to
   dispense with much of that personal and social comfort and
   gratification which those who stay at home look upon as the best
   recompense of their daily toil. The minister of Christ, if he would
   serve his Master diligently, must deny himself the rest and ease to
   which he would have a right if he were engaged in secular pursuits. For
   your Master's work, you must be prepared to forsake all and yield
   yourself up to Him unreservedly! You are not true to Christ, nor fit to
   put your hand to His plow, if you pull that hand back because it
   involves any sacrifice, however heavy. If Christ gave up the wine cup
   and renounced by that act everything like the comforts of life--you,
   too, if you have noble work to do for God--must follow His example and
   in so doing you shall have your reward!

   Our Savior did this, again, because His love to men compelled Him.
   Giving up the fruit of the vine was not, in itself, a great act of
   self-negation, but as a symbol it was very significant. As I have
   already observed, it betokened His putting aside everything that is
   considered gratifying and joyous in life. Jesus Christ, out of love to
   us, gave up all. The Heaven of heavens could not contain Him. The
   adoration of angels fell short of His Glory. He was "God over all,
   blessed forever." Yet a manger held Him and a Cross upheld Him! What a
   stoop was that--from the highest Throne in Glory to be a Man of Sorrows
   and acquainted with grief--and this out of love to those who hated Him!
   And they proved their hate by putting Him to death! Most sweetly will
   this Truth of God refresh us if we remember that it was out of love to
   us. We deserved nothing of Him. Love to miserable sinners, nothing but
   pure love, could have led Him to resign His gracious breath. He loved
   me before I had a thought of love to Him! He loved you when you were
   struggling against His Grace and defying all His Law. Oh, think of His
   giving up everything out of ardent love! How this ought to nerve us for
   toil or suffering! How it ought to inflame us with love to Him! How
   willing it should make us to give up anythingout of love to Him, and
   love to our fellow men! Alas, that so few of us ever make sacrifices
   out of love to souls! We can do a little ordinary service which
   involves but little fatigue and little inconvenience, but oh, to have
   the old spirit of chivalry burning in our breasts which would make us
   cast ourselves upon the very teeth of Death out of zeal for the cause
   of Christ! Oh, that some young men here could be moved by the love of
   Jesus to give themselves up from this moment to live and die for Him!
   Oh, that some holy women would renew their early consecration vows and
   from this very hour be servants of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of none
   beside! The Church needs some few conspicuous specimens of self-denying
   holiness, and perhaps those few, like standard-bearers lifting up the
   ensign, would attract many others--and the Church might lift herself up
   from the low level of our poor, weak, beggarly profession! We might
   then serve Jesus a little after the manner that He deserves to be
   served, and surrender ourselves to Him more after the fashion of His
   surrendering Himself for us!

   I take it that this no more drinking of the fruit of the vine means
   more than my tongue could ever tell, though I spoke on for many an
   hour. So I leave the thought with you. It is Jesus renouncing all that
   makes life happy--giving up everything that cheers and
   gladdens--sanctifying Himself for our sakes because He is called to a
   noble work by His Father and by His God. But now, secondly, I would
   have you think of our Lord--

   II. AS TAKING FAREWELL OF EARTH.

   He took the cup and, making that the symbol of everything below, He
   said, "I will no more drink of this fruit of the vine." He bade
   farewell to His disciples, and to the earth, upon which He had lived
   for 33 years--and this He did without any repining. He did not say,
   "Why am I taken away in the strength of My days? Why, when scarcely 40
   years old, must My sun go down at noon? Why, before I have attained the
   full age of man, must I be laid in the grave?" No, not a word of it,
   and when your turn and mine shall come to bid farewell to everything on
   earth, and to part with all below,

   may we cheerfully yield to the summons without one single word of
   repining against God! Oh, Lord, You have called me Home to rest--it was
   but morning, and my work was scarcely begun, and I had fondly mapped it
   out in the hope of much service to You and Your Church, but if You bid
   me come Home, I will thank You that I have not to bear the heat and
   burden of the day. Or if it is in middle life, just when my work is
   about me, and I am busy in the vineyard, that my time of departure
   should come, may I still be content! There are the plants and flowers I
   have so fondly nurtured! Yonder is a tree that was about to bud and
   here is what I hoped would be a fruit-bearing vine, but, Master, though
   I should like to have seen all these reach their maturity, and though
   my pride may say, "What will the Church do without me when I am gone?"
   Yet, Lord, You did without me before I was born and so here in the
   strength of my days You call me to leave these things, and I come, I
   come! And if the call shall come to you at night, or towards
   evening--as it will do, I know, to some of you, dear Brothers and
   Sisters, who are getting gray and old in years--I hope you will feel,
   "Lord, it is well. Our day's work is over, the shadows have lengthened,
   it is time to fall asleep. We do not stand so much in the earth as on
   it--we are waiting to be taken Home, to be gathered into the Garner."
   Yes, without regret, I say, without any repining against the will of
   God, may we heave the anchor and go into port! May we just quietly shut
   our eyes on earth and open them in Heaven to behold the Beatific
   Vision, without having made our last word on earth to be an act of
   rebellion by lamenting that the voice says, "Rise up, and come away."

   Our Lord did not withdraw from the world as an ascetic. He did not dash
   the cup to the ground or denounce its contents. He did not put away
   life, saying, "It is sour. I will taste no more of it!" I think I have
   heard some people talk about life with very much of that bitter spirit
   which cannot brook its toils and cares. They want to go Home, they tell
   us, when in truth there is more infirmity than faith in the wish they
   express! They are idle. They are not willing to bear their cross. They
   are weary of suffering for their Master. Oh, shame on us if we are like
   lazy workmen, always looking for Saturday nights! Such fellows are
   never worth their pay. Shame upon us if we are courting the grave that
   we may rest from our labors while there are yet wanderers to be sought,
   outcasts to be restored, sinners to be saved! Are there not kinsfolk
   and neighbors of ours that can hear the Gospel from our lips? Are there
   no children to be taught in our schools? Are there no little ones to be
   lifted out from the miry clay? Are there not fresh battles to be fought
   for Christ--new enterprises to be carried forward--regions beyond to be
   explored? If you have a real interest in the Redeemer's Kingdom, you
   may well ask for a longer life if it is God's will that you may take a
   larger share in these labors of love--and have weightier crowns to
   present to that dear Savior who has gone before us to prepare mansions
   for our rest! Thus, without repining on the one hand, or even a tinge
   of asceticism on the other hand, He puts away the cup with as cheerful
   an air as He took it! He sets His face towards death. "I will no more
   drink."

   And then notice how He stops, as it were, on the way His composure is
   unruffled, as though death were to Him but the goal of His earthly
   career, or rather a station on His journey to Heaven! He knows He is
   about to depart and yet He deplores it not, for He perceives that it is
   expedient for His disciples and for Himself that He should go away. Oh,
   that when our days below come to a close, when we hear the Master's
   call and feel the symptoms of approaching death, we may not be dismayed
   or frightened! God grant that we may take leave of this mortal life
   with peaceful confidence and holy calm! Should our exit be slow and
   painful, may we be steadfast in faith and full of patience! Or should
   it be otherwise, sudden and unexpected, may we be no less prepared and
   ready! Floods of wrath rose high at our Lord's death, but there shall
   be no such tumult about ours. The curse gathered around His dying
   head--a blessing shall make a halo around ours! There was no sort of
   pallet for Him to die upon--the Cross was His couch. The sweet comfort
   of looking up to God was lacking to Him. "Eli, Eli, lama Sabacthanii"
   was His dying cry! But we have our Lord to meet us and He has promised
   that He will make our bed in our sickness. Our third reflection shall
   be this-- III. OUR LORD'S WORDS CONTAINED HIS DYING ANTICIPATION.

   Said He not, "I will no more drink of this fruit of the vine, until
   that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom"? He knew
   He would die, but He knew that that was not the end! He expected
   happier and brighter days, fairer banquets, fresher wine and purer
   joys. Now, did Christ mean Heaven? I think He did, though that was not
   all. Yet were it Heaven which He just then anticipated? Follow out the
   prospect. Does He not picture Heaven to us as a place of festive
   enjoyment? When He says, "I shall drink no more this fruit of the vine
   now with you," does He not imply that in Heaven is the meeting place of
   them that triumph, and the state rooms of them that feast? All the
   enjoyments that can be imagined, and more, belong to the beatific state
   of the glorified! Whatever could conduce to make an intellectual

   mind happy, whatever could tend to make a refined spirit full of bliss,
   shall be our portion! At God's right hand there are rivers ofjoy and
   pleasures forevermore!

   We learn, too, that the joys of Heaven are social, for Jesus says,
   "Until I drink it new with you." I wonder what those make of Heaven who
   think we shall not recognize one another there? I rather admire the
   reply of a good minister to his wife, who, when she asked him whether
   he would know her in Heaven, said, "Know you in Heaven! Of course I
   shall! I know you here, and I shall not be a greater fool there, than I
   am here." We are to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and
   they will not have golden masks or veils that shall cover their faces!
   Heaven is a place where they shall eat and drink, and rejoice together,
   and I take it that much of the joy of Heaven will consist in seeing the
   bright spirits whom we shall recognize as being men and women in whom
   Christ's Spirit dwelt on earth, and in whom Christ's shall dwell above.
   Oh, I reckon on meeting David, whose Psalms have so often cheered my
   soul! I long to meet with Martin Luther and Calvin, and to have the
   power of seeing such men as Whitfield and Wesley, and walking and
   talking with them in the golden streets. Yes, Heaven would scarcely be
   so full of charms in the prospect if there were not the full conviction
   in our minds that we should know the saints and feast with them after a
   spiritual sort.

   But still our Lord's description of Heaven represents Himself as happy,
   and happy with His people, "Until I drink it new with you." Alas, these
   earthly banquets are too often so vitiated with revelry and excess,
   that while using them as emblems of the feast above, I feel as if I
   half dishonored that feast! In many cases the festivities of earth have
   become so degraded and wicked that the Christian shrinks from mingling
   with them. But we shall drink it new--this wine of Heaven. The wine of
   Heaven shall be nothing that can make us sin, or even think of evil!
   There shall be in it nothing impure or polluted--

   "PPure are the joys above the skies, And all the region peace."

   And those joys will not be like those of earth--fickle and frothy,
   volatile and variable--by reason of which we are often lifted up, only
   to betray our weakness and presumption! The wine will be new! It will
   be holier joy, purer, sweeter. It will be a Divine joy in which Christ
   will have His share and we, His people, shall each one take our
   portion.

   I have been wondering what will be the exhilarating contents of the
   wine cup that we shall drink with Christ in Heaven. I think it will be
   partly the joy of hearing that sinners repent on earth. We shall hear
   about it. The angels do. "There is joy in Heaven among the angels of
   God over one sinner that repents." Oh, how glad we shall be when we
   hear that after we were dead and gone our dear boy was converted and
   that in that place where we were once known to assemble, God's Spirit
   is still resting on the ministry! It will be a joy to hear the angels
   come and tell of tens of thousands of sinners brought to Jesus weeping,
   and finding pardon in His blood! There is a grand cup in store for you
   that love souls, when you shall hear these good tidings. It is Christ's
   cup, I know, but you, too, shall drink of it!

   Another ingredient of the joy will be to see the saints holding on
   their way and increasing in their likeness to Christ--to see the boy
   growing up and resisting temptation and all his spiritual faculties
   developing. It is the joy of Christ to see His saints below growing in
   Grace and persevering under difficulties, and that is the cup of which
   we shall drink, too! We shall be cheered by seeing our Brothers and
   Sisters who will be fighting the battle in this world when we have left
   it. Shall we see them? See them! Why not? What says the Apostle?
   "Seeing that we are encompassed about with so great a cloud of
   witnesses." Who are the "witnesses" but those bright and immaculate
   spirits who, from the battlements of Heaven, look downward and rejoice
   as they see us win the race? And we shall soon take our place among the
   spectators and look down and see the race of the righteous whom we have
   left behind, and rejoice as we see them win their crowns!

   Another ingredient of that heavenly cup will be to see the saints come
   up to Heaven. Oh, what bliss it is to Christ as, one by one, they come
   up to His bosom--the purchase of His agonies, each one exhibiting the
   power of His Grace in the change of their nature! If I could get a
   place hard by the gate, how I would like to welcome one of the younger
   ones of this congregation who may not arrive till long after we have
   entered into rest! No, Christ is not losing His reward! He does see of
   His soul's travail, and how we, too, will clap our hands as we say to
   one another--

   "They come, they come, Your exiled bands, Wherever they rest or roam,
   Have heard Your voice in distant lands, And hasten to their Home! Thus,
   though the universe shall burn,

   And God, His works destroy,

   With songs Your ransomed shall return,

   And everlastingjoy"

   Above all, and perhaps best of all, the wine cups of Heaven are filled
   with the brimming, sparkling joy of delight in God's Glory. In the
   latter days the hymn that now breaks on Christian ears shall salute the
   ear of every savage and barbarian! They that go down to the sea in
   ships shall sing the name of Christ as they spread the sail! The ranger
   in Arabia's deserts shall listen to the name of Jesus, the Savior of
   men! Far off, the swarthy inhabitants of Africa's sunny plains, and up
   yonder, where the sun scarcely shines on the natives of frosty
   Labrador, in every region of the earth, prayer shall be made for Him
   continually and daily shall He be praised! God shall be glorified, the
   whole world shall become an altar for God's praise! His saints shall
   worship Him, and sin, death, and Hell shall be overturned! And Christ,
   if He drinks of this cup new in His Father's Kingdom, will give us who
   share in His struggle, also partake in His victory!

   But surely this is not all. I think when Christ said, "Until I drink it
   new with you in My Father's Kingdom," He referred to His Second Coming
   to the establishment of the Kingdom of God--to the millennial splendor
   of the Redeemer's reign, and to that which will close it, when He shall
   deliver up the Kingdom, the mediatorial Kingdom, to God, even the
   Father, and God shall be All-in-All! I am not going to prophesy. That
   is not my line. Those brethren who can prophesy succeed so admirably
   well in duping their followers and also in contradicting one another,
   that I feel no inclination to enlist in their ranks! But if I can make
   anything out of God's Word, it is clear that a day shall come when the
   cause of Christ shall have supremacy, when the Kingdom of God shall be
   among men, when here on earth the Jew shall acknowledge the Messiah,
   and the nations of the Gentiles shall come bending before His Throne!
   There is to be a time when universal peace shall prevail, when the
   sword shall be beaten into a plowshare, and the spear into a pruning
   hook, and there is to be a day when Satan shall be bound and cast into
   his infernal den in prison--when death and Hell are also to be cast
   into the Lake of Fire. I take that to mean that there will be a day
   when good will triumph over evil, when righteousness will vanquish
   iniquity, when God shall have put beneath His feet manifestly before
   the sons of men all those rebel bands of demons and men who stood out
   against Him--and all the consequences of their sin in diminishing the
   Glory of God shall be forever put away!

   Such a day shall come when the great hallelujah shall be sung, when the
   marriage banqueting table shall be spread, when every elect soul shall
   sit at it--with Christ at the head--when every soul redeemed by Jesus'
   blood from among men, every soul quickened by the Holy Spirit and kept
   by the power of God unto salvation, shall, with his body raised from
   the dead, being perfect according to the adoption and the promise,
   stand up with Christ at the head, and--

   "Sing hallelujah to God and the Lamb, And sing hallelujah forever,
   Amen." Then shall this glorious wine cup of the New Jerusalem's best
   wine be passed from lip to lip! Then shall God be worshipped by all His
   redeemed! Then shall tears be wiped away and sin and grief shall cease
   forever! Then shall be fulfilled the saying of the Master, "I will not
   drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink
   it new with you in My Father's Kingdom." Roll on, you wheels of time,
   roll on and bring the glorious day, and may we be there! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: ROMANS8:26-30; REVELATION 21:10-27;
   22:l-5.

   ROMANS8:26-30.

   Verse 26. Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities. For we do not
   know what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit Himself makes
   intercession for us with groans which cannot be uttered. Groans, then,
   are prayers, yes, and prayers which the Spirit of God most certainly
   hears! And those desires which altogether exhaust language, or which
   cannot be put into language by reason of the exhaustion of our sorrow,
   are nevertheless heard of God, for the Spirit of God is in them.

   27. And He that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the
   Spirit, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the
   will of God. That is, when the mind lies still and God the Holy Spirit
   writes His will upon it, He also writes God's will. Hence such prayers
   are sure to be effectual, for they are but the shadow of God's secret
   purpose

   falling upon the soul as a kind of prelude to the coming fulfillment of
   that purpose! Saints' prayers are Prophets of God's mercies. We are
   sure of it! We have no doubt whatever! We know it by experience, as
   well as by Revelation.

   28. And we know that all things work together for good to them who love
   God. Not yet, "all mankind," but those who "love God."

   28. To them who are the called according to His purpose. For they would
   never have loved God if He had not called them to it, and had not
   purposed to call them.

   29, 30. For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be
   conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the First-Born
   among many brethren. Moreover whom He did predestinate, them He also
   called: and whom He called, them He also justified: and whom He
   justified, them He also glorified. One is tempted to linger over that
   golden chain and examine every link! It will suffice, however, to
   observe that every link is well fastened to the next. Where there is
   the "foreknowledge," which is also the "forelove," there is also
   "elect"--there must be '"called"--there shall certainly be
   "justification," and where that is, there must be "glory."

   REVELATION 21:10-27.

   Here we shall see a picture of what the Church of God is to be in the
   latter days. And inasmuch as this vision came out of Heaven, it gives
   us an idea of what is already in Heaven. Crowded as it is with almost
   impossible beauties, this description is given to us to let us think,
   and by faith conceive, of the glories of the future state!

   Verses 10, 11. Andhe carried me away in the spirit to a great andhigh
   mountain, andshowed me that great city the holy Jerusalem, descending
   out of Heaven from God. Having the glory of God: and her light was like
   unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal.
   But what the Glory of God may be, what mortal mind can imagine? All the
   imagery which the Apostle uses must fall far short of that simple
   expression, "Having the glory of God." That Glory is to be upon the
   Church and upon every individual member of it. The glory of every
   Believer shall be nothing less than the Glory of God!

   12, 13. And had a wall great and high. And had twelve gates, and at the
   gate twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of
   the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. On the east three gates;
   on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west
   three gates.From every quarter of the world, God's chosen shall come
   and find a gate straight before them, an entrance into Heaven! Die at
   the Equator, or die at the Pole, there is an immediate entrance into
   the rest of God from any place where we may die. Blessed be the name of
   God for this!

   14-16. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the
   names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb. And he that talked with me
   had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the
   wall thereof. And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large
   as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand
   furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
   This is an idea scarcely to be grasped, to see a city which is as high
   as it is broad! Such cities cannot exist on earth. They are meant for
   that glorious future state. They will exist under the new heavens and
   in the new earth, for which we look for at the coming of our Lord.

   17, 18. Andhe measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four
   cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. And
   the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was of pure
   gold, like unto clear glass. All these joys are without sediment of
   sin. Gold on earth is a dull thing. You cannot look into it. But the
   joys of Heaven, if compared to gold, must be transparent. "Pure gold
   like unto clear glass"--all the earth taken out of it, all its earthly
   grossness. The joy of Heaven is Divine!

   19, 20. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
   all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the
   second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; the
   fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the
   eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the
   eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.See hew lovingly our
   Apostle counts the foundations. He might have run them all into one,
   and said, "The foundations were of these twelve stones," but it must be
   the first foundation, the second, the third, the fourth. He dwells on
   every one! The joys of Heaven will bear dwelling upon--they will bear
   reflection. Here our joys, when they are over, leave but a handful of
   thorns--but a handful of ashes like thorns that crackle and blaze under
   the pot, and leave little behind them. But the eternal and spiritual
   joys will bear for us to go into detail, and each one shall be most
   precious.

   21. And thee twelve gates were twelve pearls. Whoever heard of such
   pearls? In what ocean but in the depth of God could such pearls be
   found? The twelve gates were twelve pearls!

   21. The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each individual gate was one
   pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent
   glass. Streets are used for fellowship. There men meet each other. And
   the fellowship of Heaven will be golden, bright, clear, perfect. Here,
   when we meet with one another, we soon display and discover our mutual
   faults, but there they shall delight each other with their common
   beauty, all the beauties being borrowed from the Lamb, who is the Glory
   of the place!

   22. And I saw no temple therein. For it was all one temple.

   22, 23. For the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
   And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in
   it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
   thereof Let us be going that way soon, Brothers and Sisters! Ah, may we
   all meet there. What must it be to be there?

   24-27. And the nations of them which are savedshall walk in the light
   of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into
   it. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
   shall be no night there. And they shall bring the glory and honor of
   the nations unto it. And there shall in no wise enter into it anything
   that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but
   they who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.

   REVELATION 22:1-5.

   Verses 1, 2. And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
   crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the
   middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of
   life, which bore twelve fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; and
   the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. Abounding
   joy, varied joy, ever changing, yet ever perfect--a tree which bears
   twelve fruits, and yet fruits every month! Oh, when shall we get away
   to those golden orchards? When shall we sit under those vines and press
   the clusters with our lips?

   3. And there shall be no more curse--Of labor, of sin, of sorrow, of
   death.

   3. But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it. So that we
   shall all be in the throne room, all beholding the King in His beauty,
   and ourselves made His courtiers.

   3. And His servants shall serve Him--That is Heaven to me, for here we
   sometimes are unable to serve Him as we would. We are distracted,
   worried, carried away from holy service by multitudes of cares, but
   there, His servants shall serve Him.

   4. And they shall see His face. What a happy blending--service and
   communion--the hands busy, but the eyes ravished with the wondrous
   sight of the face of God! You shall see His face! If any of us could
   see the face of God on earth, no doubt we would die. The vision would
   be too bright for us! When one heard this--one of the greatest
   saints--he said, "Then let me see it and die," and I do not wonder that
   he said so, for the sight of God, even should we die here, must still
   be perpetual and it would make us live again! "They shall see His
   face."

   4. And His name shall be on their foreheads. Their faces made like
   God's face, then--His name, His Character, reflected on their brows--is
   not this worth having?

   5. And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither
   light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light; and they shall
   reign forever and ever. They themselves shall be kings! They shall
   reign forever and ever!

The Divided Heart

   (No. 3527)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 31, 1916,

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S DAY EVENING, APRIL
   14, 1872.

   "Their heart is divided; now they are held guilty." Hosea 10:2.

   THIS was originally spoken of the Kingdom of Israel. For many years
   they had been under a king who commanded the worship of Baal and
   persecuted the worshippers of Jehovah. God chastened the people very
   sorely for this, but He did not utterly destroy them. At last Hoshea,
   the king, came to the throne. He was the last king of Israel and it is
   very remarkable that it is said of him that he was much better than
   those who went before him. He did not evil in the sight of the Lord
   after the manner of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. He was not what could
   be wished, but still he was not like the rest--and it seems very odd to
   a person who reads it casually that God should spare the nation under
   worse kings--and then should carry it away into captivity when they
   had, for once, a far better king! But the matter is explained thus.
   Ho-shea withdrew the curse of persecution from the people and they were
   left free to follow Jehovah.

   While they were persecuted--compelled to worship Baal--God, as it were,
   had compassion upon them. He abhorred their idolatry, but still His
   anger did not burn against them to the same degree as it did afterwards
   when they were left to do as they pleased, religious persecution was
   withdrawn and the pressure was taken off. Then, when there began to be
   internal discussion and strife--and some went after the true God, but
   others still followed the old idol-- then it was that God saw that the
   nation was incurable. They were altogether set upon evil and He said,
   "Their heart is divided; now they are held guilty." Or it might be
   read, "Now shall they be condemned." From which I gather that a sin in
   a certain case may be overlooked for a while, but the same sin under
   another circumstance may be speedily punished. God knows the
   circumstances of temptation in which a man may be placed, and though
   the force of temptation is not an excuse for sin, it may serve as a
   mitigation of it. A person under a tyrannizing power who is driven to
   sin by fear may be far less guilty than another who is under no such
   constraint, but who willfully, of his own heart, chooses the evil. And
   God may bear a long time with the same sin in a man under certain
   circumstances, which in another, under different circumstances, shall
   provoke Him at once to anger--and He shall sweep the man from off the
   face of the earth! Beware, dear Hearers, of deliberate sin! Beware of
   the sin which is of your own choosing! I may say, beware of all sin,
   for in a measure it is deliberate and of your own choosing--but
   especially that sin which is not brought upon you by any pressure, but
   simply by your own willful disobedience to God! This is a crying sin
   and one which God will not long put up with!

   And now I shall take the language of the text and apply it in other
   ways. "Their heart is divided; now they are held guilty."

   I. THIS MAY BE TRUE OF ANY CHRISTIAN CHURCH.

   It has long been my joy, Beloved in the Lord, that our heart has not
   been divided. We have walked together these many years in holy
   fellowship and, imperfect as we are, yet there have not been divisions
   among us. There has been no division about Doctrine. We have agreed
   upon the great Truths of God. There has been, I believe, no division
   about who shall be the greatest. We have been content, each one, to
   occupy his place in the Church and to work on. It is not our goodness
   that has made it so--it is only the power of God's Spirit which has
   kept us, who otherwise might readily have been divided--kept us as the
   heart of one man in sacred unity. Oh, let it always be so--let it
   always be so! May these eyes be closed in the darkness of death long
   before I shall see you contending, the one against the other! If it
   should ever happen that I should be unfit to go in and out among you to
   your edification, may I be laid aside and some other found round whom
   you may rally as one man, that by any means and every means the Church
   may be kept in its integrity--one in heart--a threefold cord which
   cannot be broken! Let each man endeavor to avoid giving offense to his
   brother. Let us

   all be members unto edification of the same one Lord, one faith, one
   Baptism. May the same Spirit abide in us and work with us to God's
   Glory, for we well know that a divided Church is found guilty. It is
   guilty so far as anything like usefulness is concerned. The strength
   that is spent in division is so much taken away from service. When the
   children of God use their swords against one another, they are not
   using them against the adversaries of the Lord. May our strength never
   be spent in division. A house divided against itself must come to
   nothing, but strong in the unity which God shall give us may we not be
   found guilty! I will not dwell upon that, however, but remark that the
   text-- II. MAY BE USED, AGAIN, OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CHRISTIAN.

   One-heartedness in a Christian is a great point. "Unite my heart to
   fear Your name" is a prayer which every Christian should always pray.
   "A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways." A double-hearted
   Christian--what shall I say of him? He is like the eye which when it is
   single, fills the body with light, but if it has lost its singleness,
   it causes the body to be in darkness--and if the light that is in us is
   darkness, how great is that darkness! Though a Christian, deep down in
   his soul, cannot be divided in heart, but must love his God, yet there
   may be very much of division of pursuit, division of aim and objectives
   in Christians. And, Brothers and Sisters, may I not suggest that it may
   be so with some of you, that your hearts may be divided and, therefore,
   you are found guilty? Take the Christian who desires to serve God, but
   still is equally desirous to amass wealth. Such a man--may God not put
   him into the scales and judge him, for I fear he will be found
   wanting--but if his desire for wealth is ever subordinate to that of
   the Gory of God only in a slight degree, he will never attain to any
   great eminence in the Divine Life. He cannot! In proportion as his
   vital force is divided and drawn away from the main business of life,
   he will become spiritually lean, even if he becomes peculiarity rich.
   He may be a millionaire in the world, but he will be a pauper in the
   Church. He may be a "strong" man in the market, but he shall be a very
   dwarf in the House of God! There will sure to be a guiltiness where the
   heart is so divided! The most charitable construction we can put upon
   it is that there are darker evils!

   We have known Christians, too, whose objective in life has been the
   large acquiring of knowledge, the pursuit of science, the gathering up
   of information. This, like the pursuit of wealth, is lawful enough in
   its subordinate place, but when it comes into rivalry with the seeking
   of the Glory of God, the man may become a scholar, but he will never
   become a beloved disciple that leans his head upon Jesus' bosom! He may
   be great in the classics and he may be a master in the sciences, but he
   will never be a master in Israel! The division of his vital powers, the
   lack of concentration will be sure to keep him in the rear ranks of the
   Church of God--if he is kept there. Oh, what a blessed thing it is to
   see a wholehearted Christian, who, while he pursues his present
   business, still pursues it for God's Glory! While he studies and stores
   his mind, is doing it for one objective, namely, that he may be thereby
   more useful to the Church of God and more helpful in the winning of
   souls! Give the man but one heart, one objective, and he is a man!
   Someone has said that he dreaded the man of one book--and so the wicked
   world may dread the man of one objective if that one objective is the
   Glory of God! They that have two targets to shoot at shall not strike
   either--they miss their aim--but he who lives only for God with all his
   might is like a thunderbolt launched from Jehovah's hand that goes
   crashing through every difficulty and reaches the point God aims
   at--and that the man, himself, seeks! He shall live for something! He
   shall count upon his age! He shall leave his mark! The man with an
   undivided heart--he shall not be found guilty. But he that is this and
   that--a follower of Christ, but yet something over and above that,
   almost equally as much the other, as he is a Christian--he shall be a
   poor, poor thing! He shall not enjoy the light of fellowship with God.
   He shall not walk in nearness to Christ. He shall be saved, but "so as
   by fire." No "abundant entrance" shall be administered to him into the
   Kingdom of God, our Father.

   I believe, dear Friends, and I will go a step further using the same
   words, that this case, if it should happen to be that of a minister
   with a divided heart, is more sad than it is in the case of the common
   Christian. Dear Brothers, those of us who believe that we are called to
   be ministers for Christ are, above all the rest of the Church, bound to
   devote ourselves to one thing. "This one thing I do." If other men have
   two things to do, we, by our call and office, if we are not liars in
   professing to be of God, and traitors to our office, are bound to do
   but one thing--and that is to free ourselves from the blood of all men
   that we may stand before God as His honest servants. You may depend
   upon it that a minister with his heart at all divided will make a
   failure of his ministry. It must be so. I have watched the career of a
   good many young men, though not old, myself, [Spurgeon was near 36] and
   I remember one with remarkable abilities. In his preaching there was a
   good clear sound of the Gospel. But I, who was as a father to him,
   noted that he had an ambitious desire to be

   distinguished as a speaker. I saw that even when he sought to win
   souls, it was with a view that persons might say how earnest he was. I
   could not help detecting in his conversation that there was an evident
   objective to make himself something, that he might be great in Israel.
   And I remember well how I walked with him and warned him that if God's
   servant did anything whatever for himself, God would not use him for
   His Divine purposes. That if we sacrificed to our pride, God would not
   let us stand as priests at His altar. That if we would be honored, we
   must stay down, stay humble--that God would not long bless a man who
   was self-seeking, even in the ministry of Christ. The warnings he
   received very kindly, but they never sank into his heart, and I can see
   him now! He is not here, but were he here I think he would confess the
   truth of what I say. He lies a miserable wreck upon the shore and he
   has fallen by his ambition! Had it not been for that, I would have
   conceived for him a high and excellent career. And I would say to every
   minister, "I charge you fling away your ambition! Your only ambition
   must be to be nothing, to be hated, scouted, called a fool, a
   driveller, if by any means you may win souls for Christ! But to
   cultivate rhetoric, to be an orator, to study that you may be thought
   to be a profound thinker, to labor earnestly with this idea that you
   may be esteemed to be a first-class soul-winner--even that is bad! The
   only thing is to seek to do what God would have you do and to glorify
   Him--to lay every honor at His feet and live for Him, for any sort of
   division in the Christian minister's pursuit may make him faulty." I
   believe that the man who gives himself to be a preacher should divest
   himself of the cares of this life, as the soldier does in the army,
   that he may be able to give his whole soul and life to the one matter
   for which his Lord has called him. It will be good for him to do this.
   And then he had better leave politics alone. He had better leave
   everything alone but his one work. We have not mind enough for two
   things--and besides, our work is such that if we had mind enough for 20
   things it would be best to consecrate it all to that one thing! If I
   may snatch firebrands from the flame, who will, may fill your Senate
   and may guide the policies of Cabinets! If I may lead sinners to the
   Cross of Christ and tell them of life in His dear wounds, I should be
   content, though I should never influence anything else except the
   hearts of men to the Savior! One thing, young man, if you are about to
   be a minister--one thing, my Brother, however old you may be, permit me
   to say to you and myself tonight--there is only one thing we must do if
   we would not be found guilty.

   But the stress of my text I intend to lay tonight upon one particular
   case, and that is--

   III. THE SEEKING SINNER.

   There are some persons who are awakened and are seeking salvation, but
   they are not likely to find it because their heart is divided and they
   will be found guilty. Very briefly, and very briefly, indeed, I mean to
   speak upon this disease, upon the evil of it, and suggest a few
   thoughts by way of a cure for it.

   Of this disease, let me say that it is a disease in the heart. Now a
   very small prick in the heart will kill. A great gash in the head may
   be healed, but a slight wound in the heart is deadly. A division of
   understanding or of judgment may be remedied, but a division of heart
   is a very terrible and often a very fatal disease. Let me show you how
   and in what respects some seeking souls are divided in heart.

   And they are, first, divided as to a sense of their condition. At one
   time they think they are in great danger. Tomorrow they don't know that
   there is anything very particular. When they have read a passage of
   Scripture, they believe their heart to be evil, but they forget the
   text and they think their heart is, after all, not so bad as Scripture
   says it is. They hear that there is a wrath to come and they are
   alarmed, but they get away to their friends and neighbors and say, "Why
   was I so foolish as to be frightened by the preacher?" They are in
   danger--they dare not say they are not, but yet they almost hope it is
   not true! They know it is not all right with them, yet they try to
   cheat themselves with the idea that it is pretty nearly all right. They
   are never likely to seek a Savior while they are in this condition, for
   until a man's mind is thoroughly made up that he must be saved by
   Christ or perish, he will never go to Christ. A divided heart about our
   personal condition before God is a deadly sign.

   These same seekers are often divided as to the objects of their choice.
   They need salvation tonight--they would give their eyes to have it.
   They will get to their chamber and pray, "O God, save me!" They will
   endorse the language of that hymn--

   "Wealth and honor I disdain. Earthly comforts, Lord, are vain. These
   can never satisfy-- Give me Christ, or else I die."

   Tomorrow they will forget all about Christ and they will be seeking
   after something else. Tonight they would have Heaven, but tomorrow they
   would find a Heaven on earth! Tonight they would give up sin, but
   tomorrow they wish to have much of it. Tonight they see the emptiness
   of earthly pleasure, but tomorrow they will suck it down as the ox
   drinks down water. Their heart is divided between this and that. They
   are not quite for the world nor quite for Christ--they halt between two
   opinions! Oh, that God would decide them that their heart, their
   divided heart, may not prove their ruin!

   Some seekers are divided as to the object of their trust. They trust in
   Jesus Christ, but they also trust a little in themselves. They believe
   His blood has a great deal to do with it, but they think their prayers
   have something, too, and so they stand with one foot on the land and
   the other on the sea and, therefore, they fall! They are relying upon
   self in part and upon Christ in part, and so they will assuredly come
   to destruction, for Christ will never be part Savior! It must be all or
   nothing! He never entered into partnership with sinful worms to help
   save them--He is the sole Foundation--and other foundation can no man
   lay. Alas, upon this matter, how many have their hearts divided! They
   are trusting to their Baptism, or to their Confirmation, or to their
   "sacraments"--all false foundations--and yet they are trying to trust
   in Christ at the same time! Their heart is divided and now they are
   held guilty.

   And this division is found in their love. They think they love Divine
   things, but by-and-by some earthly thing comes in and gets uppermost in
   their souls! Oh, I do remember myself when, if I woke in the morning, I
   always took care to have a godly book under my pillow, and an awakening
   book, too--Doddridge's, "Rise and Progress," Alleine's, "Alarm,"
   Bunyan's books and the like--and yet at another time I forgot all about
   that. I was hot today and cold tomorrow. I would have been ready to die
   in order to be saved, sometimes, and other times would gladly have
   escaped from the mercy of God to be permitted to "enjoy myself," as I
   said, in the things of the world! Oh, it is a sad state to be in. A
   seeker will never get Christ until he must have Christ, and he will
   never get salvation until salvation is the first thing, the last thing,
   the middle thing with him--until it comes to this, "By God's Spirit I
   must be saved! Nothing will content me. I must be saved and until I am
   saved, I cannot give sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids." The
   Lord in His mercy give us an united heart about this, for a divided
   heart, here, is a guilty heart in the seeker. Now let me speak upon--

   IV. THE DANGER OF THIS DISEASE--the evil of it. The evil of it is,
   first, that seekers with divided hearts miss the blessing. You shall
   find Him when you seek Him with your whole heart--not till then.
   Mercy's door opens to the knock of a whole-hearted knocker. A
   half-hearted seeker will have to wait many a day before that gate will
   ever give him entrance. No, Soul, if you do not think enough of mercy
   to ask for it with all your heart, you will have to wait awhile. No,
   Man, the choice mercies of God are too precious to be thrown away upon
   one who asks with a divided heart! Now look at Heaven's gate instead of
   here and there, instead of looking right and left. For you one thing is
   necessary, Sinner--just one thing. Fifty things you may leave to be
   sought, by-and-by, but now for you it is one thing, and if you will not
   make it one thing, you will miss it--miss it to your eternal loss!

   Again, remember that you who seek the Lord with a divided heart condemn
   yourselves. When you stand before the Judgment Seat you won't be able
   to say, as some will, "Lord, we did not know of this salvation. Lord,
   we never were impressed with its value," for the Lord would tell you,
   "Why, you trembled under a sermon. You knelt and prayed, and you cried
   to Me, though you lied with yours lips because your heart was not
   perfect before Me. Yet you did know the value of these things and you
   did feel them, too, in a measure, so that you are without excuse." He
   that follows the world with all his heart and thinks that is the best,
   is a reasonable man in following it. But he who thinks the world to
   come the best, and yet follows this present evil world--why, what a
   fool he is--and who shall plead for him? When he stands before God, his
   prayers will damn him, if nothing else will, for his prayers will be
   swift witnesses against him that he did know, did feel and yet he would
   not act upon his knowledge--he blotted out that which he perceived in
   his feelings. God save us from missing Heaven and from condemning
   ourselves by seeking it with a divided heart!

   Moreover, O Man, I would press one fact upon you very solemnly, and
   that is that a divided search after salvation is an insult to the
   Savior. Who is it and what is it, O Man, that you set up in competition
   with Christ? All Heaven and earth cannot produce His equal, and have
   you found something that can rival Him? What is it? Dare you say what
   it is? There have been men who have had good thoughts, but even a
   harlot's love has been chosen by them, instead of Christ! There are
   others who have loved the wages of unrighteousness, and
   Sabbath-breaking has made them forego Christ. We have known others who,
   for fear of a little scandal from their worldly companions, have been
   ashamed to follow Christ, and

   they have given up Jesus Christ sooner than bear a fool's derision! O
   Man, if you had the choice given you tonight of all the kingdoms of
   this world, or Christ, you would insult Christ if you should pause in
   the choice, for He is better than them all, and your soul's salvation
   is better than them all! "For what shall it profit a man, though he
   gains the whole world, and lose his own soul?" But I can weep for you
   while I rebuke you. What is it you put in competition with Christ? What
   is it you prefer to Christ? Man, are you mad that you should insult
   your Savior, who poured out His heart's blood for the salvation of such
   as you are, and do you think that anything can be worth the having at
   so dreadful a price as the loss of your soul, and the loss of the
   Savior's salvation? I beseech you, turn that over in your mind! I
   cannot put it as forcibly as I would, but I pray you let your
   conscience help you and answer if it is right in you to have a divided
   heart, and so to insult your Savior.

   Once more on this point, and that is, do you not know that a divided
   heart is a continued disobedience to God He says, "You shall love the
   Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your
   strength"--and now you have sinned your soul out of His favor and in
   danger of eternal death--and still with only half a heart do you turn
   to Him! You put out one hand towards God, but with the other you would
   have your sin! You would gladly go to Heaven and take your sins with
   you! You would be saved, but you want to sit both at the table of the
   Lord and the table of Satan! You desire to hold with the hare and run
   with the hounds--be the friend of the devil and yet the friend of God.
   O Man, the very thought is rebellion against your Maker! Cast it away
   from you and ask the Lord, this night, to bind all your affections into
   one bundle, and then draw them all to Him--that for you the one thing
   may be to seek salvation through Christ and reconciliation to the good
   Lord in Heaven through the precious blood of His dear Son! And now hear
   the last few words which shall be meant to be--

   V. A CURE FOR THIS DISEASE of a divided heart. And the first word shall
   be this. You ought well to have done with a divided heart when the
   matter in hand is your salvation or damnation. When a ship is floating
   gaily out at sea with favorable winds, men think but little of their
   safety. When she begins to rock and there is some danger, then their
   safety rises in importance and they put it side by side with the safety
   of the gold they carry with them! But when the winds break loose and
   the storm is up, and the ship is about to go by the board, and the man
   must leap into the lifeboat, he flings his gold away--he leaves his
   treasures loose upon the floor. As they sink into the abyss, he gives
   up anything if he may but save his life! In that dread hour when the
   vessel is going down and a handful of men alone are clinging to a mast,
   all is gone from them except the thought of saving life. And surely it
   should be so with you! When you are saved, you may begin to think of
   some other thing, but not tonight! For as the Lord lives, before whom I
   stand, there is but a step between some of you and death! Before
   another Sabbath--I may speak positively, for out of so many as there
   are here, someone of us will die this week, by all the probabilities of
   life and death--before another Sabbath one of us will lie in the shell,
   prepared to be taken to the grave! And if that should happen to be an
   unconverted man, then before another Sabbath you will know of Hell and
   of the Lake of Fire more than this Book can tell or these lips can
   utter, unless you are converted and fly to Christ! Surely in such
   jeopardy, your whole heart ought to be set upon the one matter--your
   own salvation--and I beseech you and I pray God the Spirit to make it
   so that you may now, with your whole undivided faculties, seek first
   the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. By the awful peril of your
   soul, I do entreat you linger, delay and remain undecided no more, lest
   your heart, being divided, should prove guilty and be cast away
   forever!

   Remember, again, and the argument is equally forcible, though it is
   more pleasing, the mercy that you are seeking after is worth the
   concentration of all your thoughts to find it To be delivered from all
   your past sin--is not this worth the seeking? To be made a child of
   God--is not this worth wrestling for? To be secure of Heaven, to be
   delivered from Hell--is not this worth an attempt to obtain? Oh, if it
   were necessary that you should go to your houses, tonight, and neglect
   your tomorrow's business--it does not require it, but if it did--if you
   went not to the market or to the Exchange by the week together--yes,
   and if your tables were deserted and you snatched but a morsel that
   might sustain life--and if you took no walk, had no recreation, if you
   denied yourself anything and everything until you found Christ, I could
   not blame you! I am sure it would be well worth the while! Anything,
   everything should be neglected that you might become one of the people
   of God and saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation! Did you
   know the joy that belongs to Christians, you would never be satisfied
   until you had it! The man that saw the pearl of great price saw it in
   another dealer's hands, and he thought, "I must have that! It is the
   finest pearl of all, so I must have it!" And he went his way, you know,
   and though he had many a dainty jewel, he sold all he had and turned it
   all to gold--and back he came

   to the trader--and he gave with joy all that he had that he might buy
   that one pearl, and he made a good bargain, too! And you would make a
   blessed bargain if everything were given up that you might find a
   Savior and be delivered from the wrath to come! Therefore I do pray you
   to seek Him with your whole heart.

   Once more, do remember that the Savior gave His whole heart when He
   came to save men. There was no by-play about Christ. His zeal for souls
   did eat Him up. He, loved, He lived, He died to save them! Will you
   have a divided heart about that which took the Savior's whole soul?
   Remember the devil is in earnest to destroy you. He will leave no stone
   unturned to keep you his victim that he may utterly destroy you! Shall
   Hell be in earnest to ruin you and will you not be in earnest to escape
   from it? Remember, good men are in earnest. I wish that I could speak
   to you with the tongue of an angel tonight. There is no faculty of my
   mind which I would not lay under a heavy mortgage if I might but bring
   your soul to Christ! I would willingly enough go to school, again, and
   sit at my Master's feet if He could tell me how to deal with human
   hearts aright, and stir them and draw them to the Savior! Ah, 'tis
   poorly done, but it is with my whole soul I would plead with you to fly
   to Christ! And yet 'tis but little a concern of mine, compared with the
   way in which it is a concern of yours! If I have been faithful, I shall
   not be responsible for you--it is your soul that is at stake. Sirs,
   shall I be anxious about your souls and will you not care about them?
   Do they seem precious to me and trifles to you? Shall I urge you to
   escape and will you feel, "It does not matter--it is but a trifle"?
   Lord, deliver us from this insanity, for insanity it is for a man to
   trifle with his soul, when others are in earnest for him! And God is in
   earnest. The great eternal God is in earnest! He says tonight to you,
   "Turn you, turn you! Why will you die, O house of Israel?" If salvation
   is child's-play to you, it is not to Him. He gave His Son from His
   bosom to redeem men! And He sent His Spirit unto men to sanctify them.
   He puts out His Omnipotence, lays His Wisdom under tax to find a plan
   and devise a way by which He might save mankind! Oh, trifle not where
   God is so in earnest, lest you find Him terribly in earnest in the day
   when His incensed love shall turn to wrath! Jealousy--what is it but
   love set on a blaze? And if you so hate God that you will prefer to
   live in Hell sooner than be indebted to His mercy, then rest assured
   you shall feel how heavy His arm can be--

   "What chains of vengeance shall they feel

   Who slight the cords of Love?

   How they deserve the deepest Hell

   Who scorn the joys above!"

   May God in His infinite mercy prevent anybody here from daring the
   wrath of God by following after Christ with a divided heart--trifling
   with his Maker, trifling with his soul, trifling with Heaven, trifling
   with Hell! May we be in earnest, each one of us, and may we all meet at
   the right hand of God through Sovereign Grace. The Lord bless you all,
   for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: HOSEA 10:1-6.

   Verse 1. Israelis an empty vine, he brings forth fruit unto himself Not
   to his God. It matters not how much fruit we bear--if it is for self,
   we are fruitless. A thing which is good in itself may lose all its
   goodness because stained with a selfish motive. We are to live unto
   God--and we must always be watchful about this--otherwise we may be
   doing much, and doing nothing. "Israel is an empty vine, he brings
   forth fruit unto himself."

   1. According to the multitude of his fruit he has increased the altars;
   according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.It
   is a very sad thing when the more men receive from God, the more they
   sin. But just in proportion as the land of Israel was fat and fertile,
   in that proportion did they set up altars to false gods and provoke the
   true God, who had given them these mercies. It is an ill thing when men
   grow rich and offer sacrifice to their own vanity-- when men gather
   learning and only use it to debate against the simple teachings of
   God--when just as God blesses, men cease to bless Him!

   2. Their heart is divided; now they are held guilty. A half heart is no
   heart at all. And when men seem to go after God, and at the same time
   to go after their idols, they are not going after God. Their religion
   is vain. The good side is but a pretense--the evil side is the real
   thing!

   2. He shall break down their altars. He shall spoil their images. Let
   us take heed then, dear Friends, that we make nothing into an idol. The
   shortest way to lose the dearest object of your affections is to make
   an idol of him. "He shall

   break down their altars. He shall spoil their images." Sometimes this
   is done in great mercy to God's people, for there is no greater evil
   than for a heart to be happy in idolatry. Sometimes it is done in
   judgment upon the ungodly. They will not have the true God, and the
   false god shall be false to them. "He shall break down their altars. He
   shall spoil their images."

   2. For now they shall say, We have no king because we feared not the
   LORD; what then should a king do to us? Their king was slain, but if he
   had lived, what would be the good of him without God? What is the good
   of any temporal blessing if God is not in it? It is the husk with the
   kernel gone! And if we are able to enjoy the husk, it looks as if we
   were swine, and swine are being fattened for the slaughter! What is the
   use of anything that we possess if God is divorced from it? I put the
   question again. If you are a true child of God, all the corn and wine
   in the world cannot feed you. Your bread must come from Heaven.

   4. They have spoken words. That which they spoke was not the truth. We
   cannot speak without words, but it is an evil thing when our speech is
   nothing but words. Words, words, words!--no heart, no truth! "They have
   spoken words."

   4. Swearing falsely in making a Covenant: thus judgment springs up as
   hemlock in the furrows of the field. God keep us from untruthfulness,
   and especially from a want of truth towards Himself. Do you not think
   that oftentimes, both in prayer and praise, it might be said, "They
   have spoken words--nothing more"? There has been a falsehood in the
   most solemn transaction towards God. Woe unto you, dear Friends, if
   that should turn out to be the case! You may cheat your fellow men if
   you have a heart for it, but you never will be able to cheat your God!
   He is not mocked. "They have spoken words," He says.

   5. The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth
   Aven. Why, those calves are their trust. They rely upon those images of
   false gods--those images which they set up in the place of the true
   God. Pretending thereby to worship Him, they trusted in these--and now
   they shall become their fear. He who will have a confidence apart from
   God will find his confidence soured into a fear before long. Your
   greatest ground of distress will be that which was once the ground of
   your reliance apart from God!

   5, 6. For the people thereof shall mourn over it And the priests
   thereof that rejoiced in it, for the glory thereof, because it is
   departed from it It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to
   King Jareb. The spiteful king.

   6. Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own
   counsel. These golden calves excited the desires of the king of
   Assyria, and he took them away. These gods were baits to their enemies,
   instead of basis for their confidence. They were carried away captive
   of the people with them--their god, captive--their god melted down to
   make images, or to make money for the king of Assyria! Ah, what shame
   does God pour upon idolaters! And what shame He will pour upon us if we
   have any confidence except the unseen God and if we rely anywhere but
   upon the eternal Covenant of His Immutable Grace! Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, let us try to flee away from that which is so tempting to
   sense-- confidence in an arm of flesh--and let our sole and only trust
   be in Him who made the heavens and the earth, and in His Son, Jesus
   Christ!

A Promise and a Providence

   (No. 3528)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I will feed My flock, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord."
   Ezekiel 34:15.

   BEFORE this can be done there are certain preliminaries. A flock cannot
   be fed until it is in existence. It cannot be fed, as a flock, until
   all the scattered sheep shall have been brought together. Hence, in the
   context, other promises supply this deficiency! We find, for example,
   the Lord declaring that He will search out His sheep and seek them.
   They have gone far astray. Some of them seem to have so exhausted their
   patience in wandering that they have invented new forms of sin and new
   methods of transgression. Yet the Lord will seek them till His eyes of
   mercy shall rest upon them and His hands of power shall grasp them. If
   the Lord has an elect soul in the center of Africa, He will find him
   out. Or should there be one for whom Jesus died who frequents the house
   that is infamous and has plunged into the most detestable sin, yet the
   Lord will not lose him! Having set His heart upon him, He will seek him
   till He finds him and follow him up till He reclaims him. You remember
   one of the Lord's sheep--a woman who had forsaken the paths of virtue.
   She had had five husbands and was then living with one who was not her
   husband. Yet He must go through Samaria to meet with her! He must--such
   was the Divine necessity that this sheep, which had wandered as far as
   it well could, should be brought back!

   Cheer up! Be of good courage, preacher of the Word. You may not find
   the sheep, but your Master will! Take heart, you that wait upon the
   Lord in prayer--you may see some of your agencies fail and success may
   not wait upon all your efforts, but God's purposes must stand--He will
   do all His pleasure and at the last it shall be seen that not a single
   sheep was left for want of being sought out. Nor is it enough to seek
   the sheep and to find them--they must be delivered from the dangers
   into which they have fallen. There is a promise to this effect. They
   had been scattered in a cloudy and dark day. Some of them had slipped
   from the crag and fallen into crevices, from which it seemed as if no
   hand could reach them. Others, skipping from rock to rock, had reached
   some lofty pinnacle where it seemed certain that the next move would
   dash them down the dizzy depth to ruin. But the Lord has said it, "I
   will bring them out from all places where they have been scattered."
   High up there in pride, in blasphemy, in persecution, or low down there
   in shameful degradation and infamy, they shall be brought, every one of
   them, from all the perils of evil within and evil without, and be
   gathered safely into the fold! But when, one by one, they have been
   delivered, they are not a flock till they are gathered by the Shepherd.
   They must, therefore, not only be brought out of the danger, but
   brought into the flock, safely housed, and collected into one fold. So
   the promise runs, "I will gather them altogether into one place."
   Beloved, this great work of gathering is going on today! By this man
   and by that, by this agency and by the other, the Lord is separating
   His chosen people from among the ruins of the Fall--fetching His Israel
   out of Egypt and His captives out of Babylon and Chal-dea--so that the
   whole company of the faithful may be a people separated unto the Lord!
   Let us entertain no fears as to the Lord having a Church in the world!
   With Omnipotent Power, directed by Infallible Wisdom and moved by
   Immutable Love, those whom God has chosen to be His sheep shall be
   sought out, rescued from their danger and numbered with the living
   people of the living God! Do I not now address a section of this great
   flock? Are there not many in this dense crowd who belong to that Seed
   which the Lord has blessed? Can there fail to be a rich vein of comfort
   to such in this promise, "I will feed My flock, and I will make them
   lie down, says the Lord"?

   Our text has in it a double blessing. By way of division, we will
   emphasize each word and endeavor to draw out the fullness of its
   meaning. To take the last word, first, "My flock" is--

   I. A NOTE OF DESCRIPTION.

   It describes God's people distinctively, separating them from all other
   people. They are not ravenous like lions. They are not crafty like
   foxes. They are not swift like the hare. They are not foul like the
   swine. They love not carrion like the

   raven. They are timid, trembling, weak, but they are clean and they
   love clean feeding. They are gentle. They have no guile. When Sovereign
   Grace has renewed and changed them, you may easily distinguish the
   Lord's sheep from the world's goats. Naturally, these sheep of the Lord
   have the infirmities of sheep--prone to go astray they are fearful,
   weak and liable to disease. It is said that man, a horse and a sheep
   are liable to more diseases than any other creatures. Certainly sheep
   have many contingencies. They are prone to infect others with their
   ailments. As to going astray they are so gregarious that if but one
   sheep leaps the wall, the whole flock must go after him! The Lord's
   people, in a state of nature, are very much like sheep as to their
   infirmities and, when converted, they are like sheep for their meekness
   and gentleness. Then they can suffer without repining--they can follow
   the Shepherd, for they know His voice, and a stranger will they not
   follow, for they know not the voice of strangers. This word is thus
   distinctive--it sets out a people who are no more to be mistaken for
   any other people than sheep are to be mistaken for wolves or lions!
   Question yourself, my Hearer, whether you are one of the Lord's sheep.
   Have you given yourself up to His care? Do you follow at His bidding?
   Do you desire to be washed in His sheep-washing? Are you desirous that
   He should make you to feed and to lie down in His green pastures?

   Nor is the word merely distinctive--it is likewise collective. It is
   not said, "I will feed My sheep one by one," but, "I will feed My
   flock." The Lord has only one flock, and so in this world He has only
   one Church. "Well," says one "we see 20 denominations." Thank God for
   it! I am not one of those who would deplore the fact that different
   Brothers are set for the defense of different parts of the Truth of
   God. Can you doubt that when Christ prayed that His people might be
   one, He was heard? It were almost blasphemy to think that His petition
   was denied! Very well, then, they are one. If the intercession of
   Christ prevailed, then today the Church is one! I do not believe for a
   moment that the oneness which Christ intended was ever a oneness of
   opinion, or a oneness of form of worship any more than a oneness of
   association, congregating them together in the same building! It was a
   mystical, secret, vital unity which exists in the Church of God at this
   very day! Brothers and Sisters, all Believers are really and truly one!
   When their souls are in a glow with Divine Love, and their hearts speak
   out of the fullness of their emotion, the unity of the one flock
   becomes perceptible! The little divisions in the Church of God that
   challenge your notice are like little cracks upon the surface of the
   earth--the rock is not cracked. The divisions that we have in the
   churches are only little skin wounds--the body is not divided. "Not a
   bone of Him shall be broken." The great body of Christ still remains
   indissolubly one! And here tonight, be we Independent, or Baptist,
   Presbyterian, Episcopalian, or Methodist--if we are one with Christ, we
   must be one with one another! After all, the Catholic is right in the
   expression, while he is wrong in the meaning he attaches to it, when he
   says there is no salvation out of the pale of the church. Referred to
   any worldly policy, it is a lie, but in sober truth, outside of the one
   indivisible Church of Christ lightly defined, there can be no
   salvation! But, thanks be unto Christ, every soul that knows the voice
   of God, the Good Shepherd, and follows at His beck and call, belongs to
   the one flock, soon to be gathered into the one fold. Note, then, the
   distinctive and the aggregate description--they are sheep individually
   and they are, collectively, a flock. But here is--

   II. A WORD OF DISCRIMINATION, as well as a word of description--"I will
   feed My flock"--"My flock." Oh, that sweet word, "My"! "I will feed My
   flock," not the devil's flock--let those goats browse where they will!
   Not the world's flock--let them wander on their own mountains of
   vanity! But, "I will feed My flock." Beloved, if we are the Lord's
   people by faith, remember we are His by Eternal Election. He chose us
   before earth's foundations were laid! He took us unto Himself to be the
   jewels of His crown and the delight of His soul. Before the channels of
   the sea were dug, or the sockets of the mountains were formed--long
   before the sun had scattered the thick darkness--our names were written
   upon the hands of Jesus! We are His, too, by purchase. Think of the
   price He paid for us! I am dwelling upon this to make you see how true
   it is that He will feed us. Did He choose us? Did He buy us--and will
   He not feed us?--

   "Count the purple drops and say, 'Thus my sins were washed away.'"

   Thus I, a captive, was set free! Thus I, impounded by the Law of God,
   saw the gate of the pound opened and I, the sheep of Christ, came out
   to lie down in His pastures. You are His by ties of blood, as well as
   His by purchase--and you are also His by power. He won you, fought for
   you and made you His lawful captives. You held out as long as you
   could, but at last you cried, "I yield! Almighty Love, You have
   overcome me! Now I bow myself to Your silver scepter, willingly Your
   subject." Oh, how hard it was for Christ to get some of us! Like
   wandering sheep, we strayed here, there and everywhere! And when the
   Shepherd came and began to grasp us, we struggled to get free,
   struggled for that awful liberty

   which would have been our ruin! But, glory be to God, He would have us!
   He took us upon His shoulders, He carried us home rejoicing and this
   day we acknowledge it was the victorious love of Christ which made us
   His! Yes, and we are His by our own free consent. Would you be
   another's if you could? Oh, if there could be a divorce court held
   between your soul and Christ, would you sue for a division? Say, my
   Soul, if the branch could be cut off from the Vine, would you wish to
   be severed from Him now? For His sake can you suffer shame, spitting,
   rebuke and poverty? Say, for His sake can you count the world's
   treasures to be as dross--and all its pomp and glory but as sounding
   brass and as a tinkling cymbal? I know you! You say, "Truly, by His
   Grace, I can, for He is mine and I cannot let Him go! He holds me so
   fast and He has proved unto me a love which many waters cannot quench,
   neither can the floods drown it." Thus you see, Beloved, that that word
   of discrimination, "My," has a good and grateful tone about it. "I will
   feed Myflock." Go, you who do not belong to God, and find such food as
   you can gather, but you who are the Lord's own peculiar ones, take this
   for your consolation, "I will feed Myflock." The next word, going
   backwards, is--

   III. A WORD FULL OF CONSOLATION--"I will fedMy flock." Yes, He will
   supply your temporal needs. You may run short, but you shall never
   want. When the garment has got to be threadbare, then He will find you
   another. I recollect one instance of Providence of which I was the
   almost passive agent. It was the case of a Brother Christian and
   minister. I was staying in a country town and it was requisite to
   borrow an edifice for the preaching. One Chapel could not be had, for
   the preacher was not high enough in Doctrine. And another Chapel could
   not be had for the whim of some of the deacons. But there was one
   little Chapel which the minister very willingly lent, for he said, "Oh,
   yes. To a fellow servant of my Lord and Master, I will cheerfully open
   the doors." The preacher of that night noticed that the minister of
   that little Chapel wore a threadbare coat and he observed that in his
   house there were signs of poverty. Twelve shillings a week was the good
   man's income--all that his flock could afford to give him. After the
   preacher had done his sermon, he said, "Perhaps the minister here will
   pardon me if I say that his clothes are getting much too shabby, and I
   think it would be a good thing for us all to contribute and buy him a
   new suit of clothes." 'Twas done and when I said to the minister, "I
   hope you will pardon me for such an impertinent remark?" "Pardon you?"
   he said, "why the Lord always finds me fresh clothes when my things
   wear out, and it is always some such manner as I never dreamed of." The
   good man is in Heaven, now. I believe that suit just lasted him till he
   put on the white garment before the Eternal Throne. Depend upon it,
   that as it was with him, so, if you believe in your Master, it shall be
   with you! He will give you food and raiment--that is all He has
   promised you--and if you get that, He will be as good as His bargain,
   so you must not murmur at your fare.

   "I will feedMy flock." The sense, however, is mainly spiritual. It does
   not say the Shepherd shall feed them, but, "I will feed them, says the
   Lord," and He says that He will feed them with good pasture. Good
   Doctrines, comfortable promises, sweet encouragements, tender words of
   exhortation, gentle notes of warning--these shall be their daily food!
   And, mark it, He says He will feed them on the high mountains. Some of
   His sheep do not like to go up such lofty heights. Dear me! How many
   faithful souls are frightened at the very mention of High Doctrine!
   Election is one of those mountains where grass grows of the very
   sweetest kind, but there are some of the flock who do not like to go
   there to feed. But the best food is on these high mountains. If your
   feet shall know how to stand on the craggy heights of Immutable and
   Eternal Love, if you shall know how to climb up yonder into the great
   Decrees of God, if you can take hold of His Covenant, if you can
   contemplate the Divine Purpose which is sure to all the Seed, you will
   find those to be the very sweetest and most satisfying spiritual food
   that is to be found on this side the Jordan! "I will feed My flock."
   Ah, sometimes God's people are placed where they have a very
   innutritious ministry, and then He feeds them in some other way. Their
   own private readings become a consolation to them. When, at times, some
   of the Lord's people are sick, laid on their beds, unable to go up to
   the House of Prayer, this promise, "I will feed My flock," proves quite
   as true to them at home in their seclusion as it is here in our joyous
   gatherings! If you neglect the means of Grace, in vain can you expect a
   blessing! But if you are lawfully detained from them, plead the promise
   and expect its fulfillment--"I will feed My flock."

   Are you just going to New Zealand, or are you just about to take a
   voyage to Australia, my beloved Sister, my dear Brother? God will feed
   you there. I know not how. You may be up in the back settlements, or in
   the bush, and have but little opportunity of meeting with the people of
   God, but still remember, "I will feed My flock." You are going on a
   long sea voyage, are you, and there are but few on board to encourage
   you? Well, take the promise to your God, "I will feed My flock." Or are
   you moving away from this Church, which has been like a hothouse to
   you, and going into some country village where there is no Gospel
   preaching? Never mind, Brothers and Sisters--if God sends you there,
   lay hold on

   Him by faith with these words, "I will feed My flock"--and He willfeed
   you, and you shall have enough and to spare! In the time of famine you
   shall be filled, and in the day of scarcity you shall be satisfied. "I
   will feed My flock." Again, going backwards, let us take the next--

   IV. A WORD WHICH IS FULL OF ASSURANCE.

   "I wllfeed My flock." "I will. I will. I will." See how positively He
   speaks. Not, "I think I will." Not, "I may," but "I will." Beloved,
   these "shalls" and "wills" are the very marrow of the Gospel! They make
   the strength of it. Take the "shalls" and "wills" out of the Bible and
   put in conditional "ifs" and "buts" and "perhaps," in their place--what
   a desolate appearance it would present! These "shalls" and "wills"
   stand like Jachin and Boaz, the great pillars of the Temple, right at
   the entrance, and we must see to it that we never give up these potent
   "shalls" and "wills," but hold fast and firmly to them! "I will feed My
   flock." "But," says one, "are not some of the flock lost?" Read the
   verse! He says, "I will seek them and I will feed them." "They may be
   lost, but if they have backslidden I will bring them back. If, like
   Peter, they have denied Me to My face, I will forgive them. If they
   have played the harlot, like Israel of old, and gone astray from Me,
   yet I will bring them back, for I will feed My flock." He cannot feed
   them unless He brings them back! But, "I will feed My flock. I will
   bring back all the wanderers who have been bought with My blood. I
   will." The adversary says they shall not be brought! "I will. I will,"
   says the Lord. "No, but," says proud flesh, "I will not be brought." "I
   will," says the Lord--and God's, "I will," is infinitely mightier than
   all the hosts of darkness and powers of corruption! But, Lord, there
   are some of them who have been driven away--legal preachers have driven
   them from Christ--their doubts and fears, their sins and trespasses
   have driven them away. "But I will feed My flock, every one of them,
   for I will bring them back--they shall have all their old comforts
   back, their joys and hopes shall be restored to them--I will feed My
   flock." But, Lord, some of them are broken! Some cruel blow has broken
   a leg, or some other limb of some of Your sheep. "But I will feed My
   flock. I will bring them back and heal them." You may be broken in
   heart and your faith may be weak, and your Graces spoiled, but this
   stands good, "I will, I will feed My flock." But, Lord, they are
   infected with disease--so runs the passage, "they are weak"--they have
   got some disease common to Your sheep. "I will heal them," says the
   Lord, "for I will feed My sheep."

   My dear Friends, it is not possible for an heir of Heaven ever to get
   into such a state that God cannot save him! And should he be allowed in
   Sovereign forbearance to wander to the utmost excess of sin--if he were
   even in the very jaws of the destroyer, yet our Savior, like another
   David, would pluck the lamb out of the jaw of the lion and tear it away
   from the paw of the bear! As long as you are out of Hell, Sinner, have
   hope! And, Believer, if you should sink in deep waters and be swallowed
   up of the Devourer, still, like Jonah, you shall be able to say, "Out
   of the belly of Hell I cried, and You heard me." "I will feed My
   flock." Oh, that you who are doubting and fearing would lay hold on
   this, "I will. I will. I will." Your flesh and carnal reason will
   doubtless say, "Well, I hope and trust." Away with your hoping and
   trusting! Do not halt and hesitate, but believe! If God says He will,
   who are you that you should entertain a suspicion? You shall be
   fed--God's Word cannot fail you! "I will feed My flock." Moreover, this
   is--

   V. A WORD OF DIVINITY.

   "Twill feed My flock." Who is this that says, "I will"? When a man
   says, "I will," it is often braggart impudence, but when God says, "I
   will," and, "you shall," such words are expressive alike of Sovereign
   determination and Irresistible Power! Christian, see who it is that
   makes the promise and mark who it is that will fulfill it! "I will feed
   My flock." Do you complain that you cannot feed under such-and-such a
   minister? The Lord promises, "I will feed My flock." Here you have
   Divine Infinity to be your supply! Here you have Divine Immutability to
   be your guarantee! Here you have Divine Omnipotence to be your aid and
   Divine Wisdom to be the measure of the supply which shall be afforded
   to you! Trust in the Lord and do good. When Jehovah says, "I will,"
   banish every doubt and fear and now, for time and for eternity, cast
   yourself upon your God. He says, "I will feed My flock"--let us reply,
   "The Lord is my Shepherd."

   Passing on to the second clause of the verse, "And I will make them lie
   down, says the lord, "you will please observe that this further
   blessing is intended to make amends for the harshness of the false
   shepherds. They would never let them lie down quietly. Their custom was
   always to drive, drive, drive, or else to seize, fleece and slay. But
   the Lord says, "I will make them lie down," and so redress their
   wrongs. For all the weariness they have suffered in the past, they
   shall have calm repose in the future. You know how apt the legal
   preacher is to whip his hearers with--"Do this!" And, "Do that." You
   know how certain Calvinists whip their hearers with, "If you have felt
   this," and, "If you have experienced that,"

   you may be saved. But the Lord Himself always makes His people, when
   they come fully to confide in Him, to lie down in a good fold and to
   feed in a fat pasture!

   When the Lord reveals to you that He has loved you with an everlasting
   love, is not that a good place to lie down in? When He tells you that
   having so loved you, He will never cast you away, is not that a good
   place to lie down in? When He tells you that your warfare is
   accomplished and that your sin is pardoned, is not that a good place to
   lie down in? Or supposing the message to be that Christ has brought in
   an everlasting righteousness and that you are accepted in the Beloved,
   is not that a place to lie down in? Let Him say to you, "You are My
   sons and My daughters, and I will be a Father to you"--is not that a
   good place to lie down in? Well, He does say all this to every one of
   you who has been brought to trust under the shadow of the wings of the
   Lord God Almighty! Your faith in Jesus is the evidence that He loved
   you before the world was and He will love you when the world shall
   cease to be! His righteousness is imputed to you and you are saved,
   completely saved, and Heaven is as surely yours as though you now wore
   the crown of gold! Is not this a good place to lie down in? Still more,
   He not only gives you a place to lie down in, but He also causes you to
   lie down! You know, dear Friends, it is one thing to have a promise,
   and quite another thing to live on it. Why, I am such a fool,
   sometimes, that though I know the sweetness of the Covenant, I cannot
   partake of it! Though I understand the sense and the preciousness of
   the promises, yet I cannot get a grip upon them! I remember when once
   talking to a captain on board his vessel, and telling him of the
   promises, he said to me, "Ah, Sir, the promises of God are very much
   like those posts by the riverside, strong posts driven in by the
   corporation of a country town! You see, if I could once get my cable
   right round them, it would hold my ship--but then thatis the job--to
   get the cable round them." So it is, but then the promise supplies this
   need--"I will makethem lie down. I will shed abroad the love of Christ
   in their hearts. I will make their peace like a river. I will come to
   them with such fullness of mercy, such overflowing of My communion,
   that their souls shall not dare to be afraid! They shall be sweetly
   hushed as a child is dandled to sleep upon its mother's knee. I will
   not allow a fear to vex them! I will send them such balmy breath from
   My own loving lips that their fears shall all fly away. I will make
   them lie down."

   Ah, and thanks be to God, some of us know what this means, for we have
   had to lie down. My soul has fed for a whole year on one promise. I
   know not why it was given to me, but I had it, "His soul shall dwell at
   ease," and my soul did dwell at ease! What had I else but to be at
   ease? My sins forgiven. My Heaven secure. Christ mine! God mine! This
   world mine! Worlds to come mine! Why should not I dwell at ease? And,
   Beloved, many of you, too--some of you at least--know what it is to
   enjoy the same peace! You can walk up and down the world and look into
   the grave and not be afraid of it. You can stand by a sickbed and long
   for evening to undress, that you may rest with God. You have such pure
   calm that business does not fret you--you can leave it with your Lord,
   casting all your care on Him, for He cares for you! Yes, you have such
   unspeakable joy that sometimes you could even shout for joy, for the
   love, the sweet love, the precious love, the unspeakable love, the
   everlasting love which Jesus has manifested to you!

   But there is another flock. Hear it and tremble! There is another
   flock. They never get fed at all, or, if they do, it is only on empty
   husks! It is the devil's flock! Sinner, you are of his flock and he
   only feeds you upon mere shams, pretences, delusions, lies! He never
   causes you to lie down--you know you can never lie down. Your sins
   never give you any quiet. Who has woes? Who has redness of the eyes?
   They that tarry long at the wine! Who has uneasiness? Who has pangs of
   heart? The midnight sinner! Who is he that quivers at the fall of a
   leaf? Who is he whose cheek turns pale in a storm? Who is he that
   quivers when but a little sickness gets hold upon him, and flies to the
   physician? Who is he that dares not think on death? Who is he that goes
   to the theater or to the ballroom to quiet his terror and to keep his
   conscience from being heard? Who is he whose end is destruction, whose
   god is his belly, who glories in his shame? He is here! He is here
   listening to my voice! Oh, Sinner, it is time that you should change
   your master!

   I remember an old salt, after listening to a certain sermon, coming
   with tears in his eyes into the vestry and saying, "Sir, I have served
   under the black flag for 60 years--and I think it is time I ran it down
   and had a new one." I think it is time you did the same, Sinner. The
   wages of sin is death! Fly from this tyrant master! Immanuel, the
   bright Prince of Glory, is willing to enlist you into His army! Though
   there are no conditions, I will tell you the terms. The terms are
   these, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved." To
   believe is simply to trust, to believe Him to be true. Trust your soul
   on Him! When you can do that, you are a saved man or woman! Whatever
   your sins may have been, or now are, the moment you believe in Jesus,
   you are a partaker of this precious promise, "I will feed My flock, I
   will make them lie down, says the Lord." God grant it to every one of
   you! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: DEUTERONOMY 33.

   Verse 1. And this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God,
   blessed the children of Israel before his death A very beautiful
   thought, that he should conclude his life with a blessing. Though they
   had greatly grieved and provoked his spirit, he was always meek and
   tender. And he had very much to bear from them, but this is the end of
   it all, that he will dismiss them with his blessing.

   2, 3. And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto
   them; He shined forth from Mount Pa-ran, andHe came with ten thousands
   of saints: from His right hand went a fiery Law for them. Yes, He loved
   the people; all His saints are in Your hand: and they sat down at Your
   feet: everyone shall receive of Your words. "Yes, He loved the people."
   God's appearance on Sinai was a token of His love to them, even though
   it amazed them and distressed many of them. Yet still it was a great
   thing that God should come so near to these people and should reveal
   His will to them. Dear Friends, if God should come to you with His
   fiery Law. If He should humble you, and make you "exceedingly fear and
   quake," it would be a token of love! The ungodly are left to go in
   their sin, but as for you, if you are one whom He loves, He will rebuke
   you and He will bring His Law to do its work upon your heart and
   conscience. It seems strange to you, but so it is. "From His right hand
   went a fiery Law for them. Yes, He loved the people." Oh, it is so,
   because He loves them, He reveals to them His fiery Law! "All His
   saints are in Your hand." A place of safety, a place of privilege,
   where they learn how precious they are to Him, for He holds them so
   dear that He keeps them always in His hand. "All His saints are in Your
   hand, and they sat down at Your feet." Another place for saints--they
   are always learning--they are disciples. They sit with meek humility at
   their Master's feet and drink in His words, "Everyone shall receive of
   Your words." Those who know not God's love, trifle with God's words and
   reject them. Those whom He loves receive His words and feed upon them!

   4-6. Moses commanded us a Law, even the inheritance of the congregation
   of Jacob. And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and
   the tribes of Israel were gathered together Let Reuben live, and not
   die: and let not his men be few. Here is his blessing, "Let Reuben
   live." Reuben's great sin had lost him his birthright, yet Moses gives
   him as much of his blessing as he can. If we are not allowed to draw
   the largest blessing, let us go as far as we can!

   7-9. And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the
   voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be
   sufficient for him; and be You a help to him from his enemies. And of
   Levi he said, Let Your Thummim and Your Urim be with Your holy one,
   whom You didprove at Massah, and with whom You didstrive at the waters
   of Meribah; Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
   him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
   children: for they have observed Your word, and kept Your Covenant
   Judah was the royal tribe--had to do much with warfare. Lord give him
   power in prayer! This is the peculiar benediction of those who have to
   lead the way in the battles of God. In the service of God, Levi was
   impartial--he did not wink at sin in his dearest relatives. You
   remember how they took the sword and went through the camp and slew
   their own brothers when they found them guilty of idolatry. And because
   of this faithfulness we read, "They shall teach Jacob Your judgments,
   and Israel Your Law." Above all things, a teacher of the Truth of God
   must be fearless and impartial in the delivery of God's Word! Then God
   will bless him, and it shall be said of such, "They shall teach Jacob,"
   etc.

   10. They shall teach Jacob Your judgments, and Israel Your Law: they
   shall put incense before You, and whole burnt sacrifices upon Your
   altar.True hearts, alone, can be God's priests--He will not accept
   sacrifices from those who will dally with His Truth and trifle with His
   Word.

   11, 12. Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands:
   smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that
   hate him, that they rise not again. And of Benjamin he said, The
   beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by Him; and the LORD shall
   cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between His shoulders.
   They that have God near them are safe, indeed! There is no protection
   in such a world as this like constant communion with God. We have to go
   out into a world full of all manner of evil. Go not out into the world
   without your God! Let Him dwell with you and cover you all the day
   long, and so shall you be safe.

   13. And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for the
   precious things of Heaven. Oh, in a spiritual sense, what a rich
   blessing this is! And remember it came upon that tribe whose father was
   the most afflicted of all Jacob's sons. If you are an afflicted Joseph,
   rejoice, for one of these days you shall have the capacity for
   receiving great blessings!

   13. For the dew--The Lord send us that dew tonight to rest upon our
   branch.

   13. And for the deep that couches beneath These deep eternal springs
   out of which we drink the Divine Water!

   14. And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the
   precious things put forth by the moon. They shall have blessings both
   ways--in the day and in the night. Those whom God blesses, the sun does
   not smite by day, nor the moon by night, but, on the contrary, they are
   blessed both in the one and in the other!

   15. 16. And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for
   theprecious things of the lasting hills. And for the precious things of
   the earth and fullness thereof, and for the good will of Him that dwelt
   in the bush. Oh, that we may always enjoy the good will of God, who
   wills good to us, who in all His dealings with us has a good will
   towards us. Oh, that we may have the good will of Him that dwelt in the
   bush!

   16-18. Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top
   of the head of him that was separated from his brethren. His glory is
   like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of
   unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of
   the earth and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the
   thousands of Manasseh. And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in
   your going out; and Issachar, in your tents. You that go much abroad in
   the world, God give you to rejoice in your opportunities of doing good.
   You that never go abroad, but live at home in the kitchen and the
   parlor, learn to rejoice in your tents, for there, too, you have a
   sphere of holy service!

   19-22. They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
   offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance
   of the seas and of treasures hid in the sand. And of Gad, he said,
   Blessed is He that enlarges Gad: he dwells as a lion, and tears the arm
   with the crown of the head. And he provided the first part for himself,
   because there is a portion for the lawgiver; and he came with the heads
   of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD and His judgments
   with Israel And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap
   from Bashan. "And of Gad, he said, Blessed be He that enlarges Gad."
   God knows how to enlarge His people, give them more Grace, more gifts,
   more opportunities of usefulness. Which He did. His tribes enlarged
   their boundaries by a sudden leap. God gives His people sometimes their
   leaping times--they leap from Bashan--some great purpose is
   accomplished, some great feat is done.

   23. And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full
   with the blessing of the LORD: possess you the west and the south What
   a condition of heart to be in! "Satisfied with favor; full of the
   blessing of the Lord." Beloved, may you enjoy that tonight!

   24. And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him
   be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.Then
   will he leave a mark wherever he goes of holy unction. He possesses it
   himself, and he will impart it to others.

   25. Your shoes shall be iron and brass, and as your days, so shall your
   strength be. Will not some Believer grip that promise tonight and find
   it true?

   26-28. There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rides upon the
   Heaven to your help, andin His excellence in the sky. The eternal God
   is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and He shall
   thrust out the enemy from before you; and shall say, Destroy them.
   Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be
   upon a land of corn and wine; also His heavens shall drop down dew.
   "Israel then shall dwell in safety alone." There is no place for God's
   people like a separated place--they must get outside the camp--they
   must not be numbered among the people. Notice, there is none like unto
   the God of Israel, and there is none like to Israel.

   29. Happy are you, O Israel: who is like unto you, Opeople saved by the
   LORD, the shield of your help, and who is the sword of your excellence
   And your enemies shall submit to you; and you shall tread upon their
   high places. As God is by Himself, so all His people are favored beyond
   all others

More Room for More People

   (No. 3529)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "It is done as you have commanded, and still there is room." Luke
   14:22.

   How delightful it is to observe that the wrath of man becomes tributary
   to the Glory of God! See an illustration in the parable of the marriage
   supper. Those persons who were first bid would not come. In order to do
   the good man of the house a despite, they declined his invitation, they
   refused to grace his board. Instead of causing his honor to be
   tarnished, they were, against their own will, the means of increasing
   his reputation! Had they come, it would only have been said that he
   made a great feast for his good friends. As they did not avail
   themselves of his hospitality, he brought in the beggars from the
   streets and swept the hedges and the byways to find the poorest of the
   poor--to all of whom he gave a hearty welcome! So it became the common
   talk all over the land, and tens of thousands extolled the generosity
   of the host who had given such a sumptuous banquet to such strange
   guests. Let not the haughty, the arrogant, or the scornful of the
   children of men imagine that their paltry conceit can thwart God's
   Covenant purpose or bring discredit on the riches of His mercy! Oh,
   Sinner, if you reject a Savior, it shall be your own loss, not His! If
   you live and die without faith in Christ, upon your own head the
   fearful recompense will fall! When the self-righteous reject Him, it
   only causes Jesus to say, "I came not to call the righteous, but
   sinners to repentance." When the rich men and the rulers refuse the
   Gospel, then, "the poor have the Gospel preached to them." When the
   wise and prudent put it aside, then it is graciously revealed unto
   babes! Thus God is glorified, though the temper of men is ever so
   turbulent. Let us, my Brothers and Sisters, always be patient of heart
   when we see the rage of men awakened against the Gospel of Christ. They
   can do it no hurt! His purpose shall stand--He will do all His
   pleasure. The bit is in their mouths, the hook is in their nostrils.
   Let them roar as they may, they cannot resist the force by which they
   are driven as chaff before the wind! He will surely perform His work
   and His name shall be glorious!

   Not less delightful is it to observe how the anger of God, instead of
   venting itself in rashness, vindicates His goodness. In reading the
   parable to you just now, I noticed to you that because the man who made
   the feast was angry, he said, "Go out quickly into the highways and
   hedges, and bring in the blind, and the crippled and the lame to the
   supper." So kindly disposed was he, that his very anger impelled him to
   an extraordinary deed of kindness! The Lord was angry with the Jews,
   and His Apostles turned to the Gentiles. The natural branches of the
   olive were put away in His wrath--but what then? Why, He took us who
   were of the wild olive and grafted us in who were heretofore wild and
   alien, so that even His anger towards Israel turned to the benefit of
   the Gentiles--and we get reconciliation out of their rejection! May we
   not regard this as a rule of His government? When a congregation hears
   the Word and tramples it under foot, what marvel if God takes the
   candlestick out of the place in His anger? But does He break the
   candlestick? No, He moves it to another place! Others get the benefit
   of the Light which those despised had it aforetime. Great God of
   Wonders, we bless You that even when Your anger burns, Your mercy
   brightly shines. Amidst the thunder and the storm, soft showers are
   rained in silver drops to make glad the earth!

   Our text tells us that the servant said, "It is done as you have
   commanded, and still there is room."

   I think I see here a satisfactory announcement--"It is done as You have
   commanded." A remarkable statement-- "still there is room." And an
   implied consummation--that the room will eventually be filled. First,
   then--

   I. A DESIRABLE ANNOUNCEMENT.

   He said, "It is done as you have commanded." Those who serve God best,
   have generally the least to say about it. When I hear people boast of
   their religious attainments, I am apt to seriously suspect their
   deficiencies. A boastful Christian I knew something of, when talking to
   an earnest man, met with very curt replies. "And pray" said the one,
   "have not you any Grace ?" "Yes," said the other, "but I never had any
   to boast of." Disciples who are fullest of Divine Grace will

   be slowest to vaunt. Humility befits a servant. "It is done," sounds
   better than, "I have done as you have commanded." In like manner the
   man who gained five pounds in one of the parables did not come and say,
   "Lord, I have gained five pounds"--he said, "Your pound has gained five
   pounds" That was the more delicate way to put it--not as an affectation
   of speech, but with a becoming modesty. So, too, with the Church of
   God, when she has done as Christ commands her, she will always feel
   desirous to wait upon Him as a humble servant, accounting this no more
   than her duty. Besides, the declaration appears to have been made in a
   waiting attitude, with an expectancy of having something more to do.
   "It is done as you have commanded, and still there is room," so that
   the servant seems to stand ready to do something more to fill the
   vacant places at the feast. And thus we ought always to stand as
   Christians when we have done our best-- waiting for fresh directions,
   never saying, "I have done enough, and now I can retire from service."
   Rather let God be thanked for what we have been enabled to do, but,
   strengthened and encouraged by success, let us resolve to do more and
   entreat Him to show us what still remains to be done, and what more we
   can have the pleasure of doing! "Oh, my Lord, I have grown gray in Your
   service! Fulfill to me Your promise, 'You shall bring forth fruit in
   old age to show that the Lord is upright.' Do not put me away from your
   loved employ. Honor me with some other task. Delight my willing soul
   with some fresh command. Bid me do or suffer your will, but pass me not
   by, leave me not to be a laggard, not honored and uninterested in
   fulfilling my Lord's requests." So let the Church of God always feel
   that she has never come to the place where she can say, "Rest and be
   thankful." "Higher, higher, higher, higher," must still be her motto!
   If her missions have conquered one continent, they must invade another!
   If half the world has been converted, there would be no rest to us till
   the other half were converted likewise. "It is done as You have
   commanded, and still there is room--room for more work, because there
   is room for more guests at Your feast."

   Did I not say that this was a desirable announcement? I am afraid these
   servants said what we would, some of us, hesitate to affirm. "It is
   done as You have commanded." Alas, how few churches could say this! And
   where the church might collectively affirm it, many members of the
   church would shrink from professing individually to have done as the
   host commanded! For what was that your Lord enjoined? "Go out quickly."
   How little there has been of going out after sinners! We have been
   content to preach to those who came to hear us! Of course, if the
   people will come to hear us in such numbers, and throng this Tabernacle
   so constantly, we have no reason to go away from them. But, alas, there
   are places of worship which I could indicate without difficulty that
   are not filled, that never were filled, that never will be filled,
   where there are, probably, as many spiders as there are persons under
   ordinary circumstance where there are certainly more pews than sitters!
   And yet it does not seem to have ever occurred to the preacher that he
   should go out after the people! Small congregations will continue to
   worship in places not one-fourth occupied, when they might go across to
   the theater or the music hall, or to some other large building into
   which the people might come, and where they might be met with! It would
   be a strange thing for the supply of fish, if our fishermen only sat at
   the window and caught what came beneath it--but never went forth to sea
   after the fish! There would be little game, I guarantee you, upon his
   lordship's table if he sat at the drawing room window to shoot only
   that which came there to be shot! But it does not come that way. The
   moors must be trod and the covers must be beaten! So if we are to have
   many sinners saved, we must go out of our own quiet haunts and go forth
   into frequented places. We must preach in the street, or at the market,
   or on the village green! We must take the Word to the people, if they
   will not come to the Word. "Go out, go out," says the Savior. This is a
   word that should ring loudly in the ears of many Christians. You have
   almost heard enough sermons--go out and teach yourself! While you have
   been eating the fat and drinking the sweet, multitudes are perishing
   for lack of the heavenly bread. Go out and break it to them! Oh, that
   there might come a holy impulse upon many here present to begin some
   good work for Christ! Break up some soil up to now uncultivated! Make
   an eruption and an invasion into Satan's territory! There is no land
   that yields so well as that which is newly broken up. The virgin soil
   that has long been given up to the forest, the brier and the thorn--let
   but the plow go through this and there shall be sevenfold harvests! No
   preaching is half as successful as that which carries the Gospel to the
   dissolute classes--those who have never been hardened by hearing and
   rejecting the tidings of mercy--those who, albeit they may have their
   faces stained with immorality, certainly have not any affectation in
   their manner! To these it comes like a new thing--it strikes them as
   sweet music and, hearing the joyful sound, they full often turn to God
   and live! To this day is it true, as our Savior said in His day, that
   publicans and harlots enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before
   Pharisees! This is a sphere of labor that remunerates the laborer. The
   lowest of the low, when hearing the Word, often accept what the
   so-called respectable despise. Go out, therefore, go out!

   Know this, likewise, that the matter is urgent, for the Master said,
   "go out quickly." Here, again, I am afraid we cannot say we have done
   this. "Go out quickly"--go out in haste, go out with the utmost
   speed--go out as one who runs on an errand, anxious to fulfill his
   mission! Go out, not listlessly, as if you had to wait for an
   opportunity, but eagerly, knowing that this is the opportune time!
   Hurry yourself to have it done at once. Go out quickly. The world goes
   by steam, nowadays, while the Church still jogs on by the broad-wheeled
   wagon! I know some churches that crawl like a snail upon a small leaf,
   making much ado to accomplish nothing! If half a dozen converts are
   added in 12 months, they think it is rather too many to be safe, and
   they are half afraid that they cannot be all genuine Christians! They
   would gladly "summer them and winter them," as they say, and try them
   in half a dozen modes. In fact, it seems to them as if God never sent a
   new-born convert into their church except for them to worry it--not for
   them to accept it as a blessing from Heaven and to train it, and nurse
   it--but to worry it! This will never do! We are to look after something
   more rapidly than the progress which these churches will ever make. Go
   out quickly! Men are dying. There is no time for us to be quibbling
   among ourselves! It behooves us to show our zeal rather than waste our
   energies. Men are perishing! We must preach the Gospel to them
   now--tell them that it is "now or never" with some of them--make known
   to them a present Savior, and cry to them, "If God is God, serve Him!
   If Baal is God, serve him! How long will you decide between two
   opinions, for the Holy Spirit says, 'Today, if you will hear His
   voice'"? There needs to be promptness, quickness, speed, eagerness
   after souls in the preachers of the Gospel. "Go out quickly."

   And have we not failed in another point? "Go out quickly into the
   streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the blind, and the
   crippled, and the maimed, and compel them to come in." There are
   certain missions now established for which we have reason to bless God
   greatly. There are works going on in London which are to the glory of
   Christendom. God speed them all! Such beloved friends as Miss
   MacPherson, Dr. Bernardo, our brother Orsman and many others deserve
   our love and esteem, for they have given themselves up to work among
   the poorest of the poor and the lowest of the low, bearing a great deal
   which some of us might shrink from, rejoicing to show their diligence
   among a people much neglected--and reaping a good harvest of comfort to
   themselves in the salvation of souls! But, dear Friends, where there is
   one of such works, there ought to be 50--and with this population of
   London, verging now upon four millions, when we have added all these
   works of faith and labors of love together, we might well say of them,
   "What are they among so many?" May God touch many of your hearts, my
   Brothers and Sisters, and make you feel the soft touch of sympathy for
   the perishing, while you hear the Master's words spoken to you, "Go out
   yourselves quickly, and lay hold on the blind, and the crippled, and
   the maimed and bring them in to the supper" Yes, bring them to Jesus!
   You cannot do it of yourself, but His Spirit dwells in you. Do not
   forget that! You are not an ordinary man. You are not an ordinary
   woman. "Know you not that your bodies are the Temples of the Holy
   Spirit?" God dwells in you! And with God in you, what can you not do?
   Have but faith in the indwelling Deity and attempt difficulties--no,
   attempt what some think impossibili-ties--and you shall find that with
   God all things are possible! Weak as you are, yet, through His
   strength, you shall perform all things! I pray God for this Church,
   that she may not be found guilty at the coming of Christ of not having
   gone out after the poor. Encourage them to come to this house at all
   times, whenever you can. I do not know where we are to put any more,
   but there is Thursday evening, and there is Monday evening, and there
   is room then. Oh, bring in whomever you can, for perhaps when the
   Gospel is preached, God may bless it to them. Let us not be deficient
   in this. In the next place we proposed to draw your attention to--

   II. A REMARKABLE STATEMENT.

   They had fished up all the poor people in the city and they had brought
   in the four characters--the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the
   blind--and after that it was alleged "still there is room."

   Well, well, that is a very encouraging piece of information for ungodly
   people here! For those who have not come to Jesus, this is welcome
   information! "Still there is room." Now we know there is still room for
   sinners, from several considerations.

   We may infer it, to begin with, from the Doctrine of Election. God has
   chosen unto Himself a people. We are told that their number is a number
   that no man can number. Well now, those who are saved are not so very
   many. They are a great many more than some bigots would like to
   believe, but they are a great many fewer than some enthusiasts would
   imagine! I am sure God has not yet saved enough to accomplish the
   number that He has proposed to save, by a very long way. It is my own
   belief, as it is my earnest hope, that in all things Christ will have
   the preeminence. As in other things, so also in this, He will have more
   souls than Satan, that He may have the preeminence over the old
   serpent. It does not look to me that there should likely be at the
   last, more lost than saved. We cannot answer the question to a
   certainty, but

   surely the Lord's mercy will triumph over human sin and God will get to
   Himself the victory! A good Divine used to say that he hoped and
   thought that, at the last, there would be no more persons lost, in
   proportion, than there might be found of persons in prison, in any
   well-ordered State, in proportion to the number of those who were
   citizens at large. I only trust it may be so. But the lines of God's
   election do not encompass a mere handful. There is a great and vast
   number chosen by Him--and there is no such great and vast number
   gathered in yet. Therefore, we are persuaded that there is still room.

   Next, the efficacy of the Atonement leads us to believe this. The
   Atonement that Christ offered on the Cross was no small matter. It was
   the sacrifice of Himself as an Infinite Being--as God and as Man--and I
   dare set no limit to it in its efficacy, itself considered. The death
   of so august a Person, in circumstances of such dishonor, amid agonies
   so inconceivable, must have about it an amount of virtue utterly beyond
   all reckoning! Jesus Christ is to see of the travail of His soul and to
   be satisfied--and the travail of His soul does not mean the few
   Christian people that are now in the world or have been--and His
   satisfaction will not be consummated by the few millions that have up
   to now been saved. Why, it does not satisfy us yet, and our hearts are
   narrow compared with His! He will not be satisfied unless myriads are
   His. The jewels of His crown must be countless as the stars of Heaven
   by night, and as the sands upon the seashore by day! By that
   bottomless, fathomless Atonement, I believe that there still is and
   must be, room--

   "Dear dying Lamb, Your precious blood

   Shall never Lose its power,

   Till all the ransomed Church of God

   Is saved to sin no more."

   The end has not been reached! The virtue of the blood has not been
   stayed. The ransomed Church has not been all gathered in. So there is
   still room!

   Again, when I consider the greatness of the adorable Persons who
   entered into Covenant to devise the wondrous plan and accomplish the
   mighty work of salvation, I feel persuaded that there is still room.
   Who is it that saves me? It is God who made Heaven and earth! He
   devised the magnificent purpose according to the good counsel of His
   will. Do you think that the Architect of yonder heavens has designed a
   little Church for the display of His Glory? Do you think that He who
   spread the stars abroad in all their countless hosts to adorn His
   universe has limited the number, with causeless thrift, of brilliant
   diadems who shall celebrate the everlasting song of His praise? We
   think not! It was Jesus who worked salvation and do you think that such
   a Savior, of such unrivalled dignity, came to effect a petty salvation
   for a petty few whom you might count upon your fingers? Incredible!
   Impossible! God forbid! And what shall I say of the Holy Spirit, whose
   majesty awes us, whose mystery baffles us, whose mercy enlivens us--the
   Spirit of God who works in us that salvation which the Christ of God
   has worked for us--do you think that He has come to dwell on earth with
   any small or insignificant intent? What small sect will contribute to
   His satisfaction? No, Glory be to His name, He brought three thousand
   in on the Pentecostal day, and He will yet cause nations to be born in
   a day, and the Church shall cry, "Who has begotten me these?
   These--from where did they come?" If I go to Gethsemane and see the
   bloody sweat, I expect a wondrous harvest from that matchless sowing!
   If I stand on Calvary and mark the flowing wounds, I expect a marvelous
   reward for those tremendous griefs! If we are not to be pitifully
   disappointed, there must be something greater yet in reserve than the
   world has ever seen! The history of Christendom is far more grand than
   any chapter that has yet been written. There is room! There must be
   room for the feast of mercy--much room still to be occupied! It is not
   yet half filled! Scant at present is the array of guests, compared with
   the complement of those who must be brought in!

   "Still there is room." With a mysterious spiritual consciousness, with
   an eager, sympathetic anxiety, the Church feels and knows that there is
   room. The individual yearnings of our Lord's disciples attest it. Do I
   not myself daily feel as if there were room--places that need peopling,
   as well as people that needed placing at the feast? Brothers, our
   Churches prove that the fresh converts introduced into their fellowship
   are like fresh blood poured into their veins. A Church cannot long be
   happy and healthy without recruiting, renewing, reviving--and we are
   always needing fresh workers with the dew of the morning upon their
   souls! We are needing preachers powerfully impressed with their own
   call to proclaim the Gospel. Many pulpits need them! We need
   Evangelists--men who have just welcomed the news, the good news, the
   heavenly tidings, and hasten to tell it at the corners of the streets,
   to the passengers along our thoroughfares! Lovers of souls, seekers of
   souls, oh, how much we need them! Many a Sunday school needs teachers.
   Many a Ragged School needs self-denying assistants! Everywhere there is
   a need--a real need--for more helpers in the Church, for more laborers
   in the harvest! So there must be room to store the fruits they need to
   reap!

   As the benches of the feast seem to groan for guests, so does the
   Church long after fresh access to her community. Were you here
   sometimes at the Monday night Prayer Meeting, you would feel there was
   room! Some of our Brethren pray as if they had room in their hearts for
   hundreds and thousands that must be reclaimed! When the Church gets
   into the spirit of prayer, her cries and groans give proof of secret
   tears and private wrestling. Her earnest members, by the instant
   entreaties made to God, prove that the Church feels that the guest
   chamber is not yet full. Her tent is not filled with children--she is
   crying out, like Rachel of old--"Give me children or I die." She needs
   to see her converts multiplied, she longs to stretch forth the curtains
   of her habitations. There is--there must be room! Judging by my own
   experience, I say that the minister can generally feel when God is
   saving the souls of his hearers. The efforts and anxieties of his labor
   are accompanied with such pangs and throes within his own soul that he
   is well content with the pain and travail for the joy he has in
   prospect! When last week I had some conversation with the candidates
   for Church fellowship, my heart rejoiced as I found out how many of you
   had lately found the Savior. After being half-dubious whether a
   blessing had attended the sermons I recently preached, as I listened to
   the stories of conversion that so many told me, it made my heart leap
   for joy! The fact was no tidings had come to me of the expectations I
   had fostered. There is an interval between the sowing time and the
   reaping time. But I am encouraged. No doubt there are more of you
   coming. All but decided now, you will be altogether decided soon. God
   is at work with you--He means to bring you in, that His Grace may have
   honor. Well, those desires and prayers, those longings and hopes, those
   wishes and expectations of the Church all show that she does not feel
   thorough satisfaction with present results--and certainly she feels no
   misgiving as to the accommodation ready for all comers.

   "Still there is room." Yes, God be praised, there is! That mother says,
   "Ah, that my child were brought in!" Blessed be God, there is room for
   him! And the father says, "Oh, that my sons were saved!" Well, there is
   room for them! There have been thousands who have gone to Heaven of
   late, but still there is room! There are thousands who have come to
   Christ of late, but still there is room! Prophets, Apostles, martyrs,
   confessors, saints have gone into Glory, but still there is room! In
   this Church hundreds have pressed in to know the Lord, but still there
   is room! There is room! There is room! And there is room for you!
   Blessed be God for that! Oh, that you may occupy that room! My third
   point is this, that there is implied in the text--

   III. A MOST BLESSED CONSUMMATION that the room will be filled.

   It is an old saying of the natural philosopher that nature abhors a
   vacuum. It is true, I doubt not. But here is another axiom--Grace
   abhors a vacuum. The good man of the house could not bear to see a
   vacant seat at his table. All things were ready, but there were empty
   places and he did not like it. The glory of the feast is to be found
   not merely in the provisions, but in the guests, so he must have the
   chairs occupied as well as the table covered. With reverence let it be
   said, the Glory of Christ lies not only in His Sacrifice, but in the
   sinners that that Sacrifice saves! A king is no king who has not any
   subjects. A head is no head if it has not a body. And so Jesus Christ
   would be a King without subjects if there were none saved. He would be
   a Head without members--and that is a ghastly thought! He must have a
   people and, what is more, He must have all His people. In our natural
   bodies, if but a little finger is missing, the body is not perfect. So
   also in Christ--if all His members are not saved, there would not be a
   perfect Christ! The Apostle tells us that the Church is the fullness of
   Christ. Hence if a part of the Church were lost, a part of Christ's
   fullness would be lost. Therefore He must cause all to come in the
   unity of the faith unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature
   of the fullness of Christ, for Grace abhors a vacuum! When at last the
   end shall come, and the dispensation of Grace shall be wound up, it
   will be seen that at the Table of Mercy here below, there was not a
   seat left empty! "All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me." "Whom
   He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image
   of His Son. And whom He did predestinate, them He also called." So it
   shall be. Satan shall not be able to point to a single empty place and
   say, "There should a certain soul have been seated. God appointed it,
   but I frustrated His purpose!" That cannot, shall not be! The wedding
   must and shall be furnished with guests!

   In like manner the Table of Glory, like the Table of Grace, while the
   board is richly spread, the seats shall be amply filled. There at that
   Table, blessed be God, there is a place for me, and none of you can
   occupy it. It will be only occupied by him for whom it was designed. If
   you believe in Christ, dear Friend, there is a place for you, a
   freehold, a vested right of which you cannot be deprived! There is a
   crown that will fit no other head than yours. There is a harp that will
   yield music to no other hands than yours. There is a mansion among the
   many, many mansions in our Father's House for your residence. There
   will be no mansions in Heaven at last untenanted. In some streets of
   London, "To let" is written on half the houses. Cheerless is the
   lookout. But when at last the King shall bring His children Home, there
   will not be one pre-

   pared mansion that has lost its prepared tenant! The reserved
   inheritance shall revert to the reserved people--the purchased
   inheritance shall inherit the purchased possession! This gives me hope
   in preaching! It convinces me that I do not preach in vain. There must
   and there shall be some saved. God has declared it! God has made ready
   for it on earth and He has made ready in Heaven for it. Therefore, they
   shall be brought in! His preparation shall not be in vain. His wedding
   shall be furnished with guests. This certainty fortifies me against an
   apparent contingency. It inspires me with hope about some of you, my
   dear Hearers, who look hesitant, that you, before long, will be
   resolute. If you come to God, there are preparations made to receive,
   to welcome you, to lodge you, to feed you, to supply all your needs. Do
   you desire to come? You shall not be cast away. Why should not you wear
   one of these crowns? Why should not you tenant one of those mansions?
   "Still there is room."

   But who will help to fill that room? Who out of this dense throng of
   people will help to fill the vacant places at the Gospel Supper? I
   cannot call you one by one, as I would like to, but I do call to you
   with all my heart, Come to Jesus! Should you say, "How shall I come?"
   Well, it is not a motion of the body--it is a motion of the mind. "What
   sort of motion of the mind?" do you ask. It is trust--trust--simple
   conviction and unquestioning faith! If you commit your case to Him, He
   will be concerned for you. Follow Christ--you shall have fellowship
   with Him. Your resolution will be evidence of your Redemption! Your
   plea will procure a sense of His pardon! By your acquiescence you will
   learn that you are "accepted in the Beloved." May God incline you, by
   the mighty operation of His Spirit, to come to Jesus! So shall my
   prayers be answered! So shall your souls be blessed forever! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 8:41-56.

   Verses 41, 42. And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a
   ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus 'feet, and besought
   Him that He would come into his house: For he had one only daughter,
   about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as He went the people
   thronged Him. Notice the word, "behold," for this was a wonder that a
   man so high in position to come to Christ at all, especially one who
   was in an ecclesiastical position, for he "was a ruler of the
   synagogue." Usually those who had to do with the synagogue were great
   despisers of our Lord Jesus! God works great wonders, however, and
   sometimes the camel does go through the eye of the needle! This man's
   name was Jairus, a common Jewish name, and you will find it was the
   name of one of the judges recorded in the Book of Judges. Note this
   man's humility, "He fell down at Jesus' feet." The greatest of men must
   humble themselves before they can obtain mercy. Jesus Christ is always
   ready to receive, to accept and bless all those who fall down at His
   feet, but those who lift up themselves shall find Him to be their sure
   and swift enemy--and the day shall come when He shall abase them to the
   dust. "He besought Him that He would come into his house, for he had
   one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying." She
   seems to have been not only the darling of the house, but of all the
   neighbors, too, for we find that all the neighbors came together to
   weep and to lament her. You find Matthew says that this daughter was
   already dead. It seems that some delay arose, so that the child died,
   but the father, with triumphant faith, still besought Him to come and
   raise her, even from the very jaws of death.

   43, 44. And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had
   spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,
   came behind Him and touched the border of His garment: and immediately
   her issue of blood stopped. This disease laughs at the physicians, and
   whenever a cure has been effected it has always been a slow one. Hence
   the supernatural character of this cure, "Immediately her issue of
   blood stopped." This is the glory of our blessed religion, that it
   heals sin-sick souls at once and upon the spot! The moment a man
   believes in Jesus, his nature is changed! He becomes a new creature--in
   that moment all his sins are gone! In that same hour he becomes heir of
   God, and joint-heir with Christ. "Immediately."

   45. And Jesus said, Who touched Me? When all denied, Peter and they
   that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng You and press
   You, and do You ask, Who touchedMe?What impudence on their part!
   Doubtless there are many things we say of our Lord, and even to Him in
   prayer, that are very far from such words as He should have from His
   disciples. There were many who touched Him out of curiosity, and
   doubtless some out of lack of respect to His Person came too close to
   Him, but there was only one who touched Him with the finger of faith,
   which was the only true touch!

   46-48. And Jesus said, Somebody has touched Me, for I perceive that
   virtue has gone out of Me. And when the woman saw that she was not hid,
   she came trembling and, falling down before Him, she declared unto Him
   before all the

   people for what cause she had touched Him, and how she was healed
   immediately. And He said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: your
   faith has made you whole; go in peace. Faith crowns Christ and,
   therefore, Christ takes the crown off His own head and puts it upon the
   head of faith. "Your faith has saved you." Christ's virtue would not
   have saved her without her faith--and certainly her faith could not
   have saved her without Christ's virtue! We ought to note how vital
   faith is to true salvation, and what a high degree of importance is
   attached to it. Let us, therefore, if we have some degree of faith,
   pray for more, "Lord, increase our faith, for if a little of it may
   heal, what may not a great faith do?"

   49. While He yet spoke, there came one from the ruler of the
   synagogue's house, saying to him, Your daughter is dead; trouble not
   the Master Be resigned, and say, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken
   away," and expect not the blessing back again. Do as David did, who,
   while the child was yet alive, fasted and prayed, saying, "Perhaps God
   will spare him," but when he was dead, fasted no more. Your daughter is
   dead--trouble not the Master." Ah, but this man knew that He who can
   stay the soul at the gates of death can also bring it back from the
   gates of death if He wills. He that can get it from the paw of the lion
   can get it from the jaw of the bear! He can deliver His people at all
   times and at all seasons, and even Death is a conquered foe!

   50. But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, Fear not: believe
   only, and she shall be made whole. "Believe only." What a depth lies in
   those two words! Believe only! Ah, Lord, it ought to be the easiest
   thing in the world to believe You, for You are so truthful! You keep
   every promise to us, and yet sometimes when we are in the dark, and
   when circumstances go contrary to us, it is hard to believe--but is it
   not the hardness in our own hearts? Believe only! Christian, what is
   your trouble this morning, what is your trial? Believe only, and let
   your humble faith cast your burdens upon your God! "Believe only, and
   she shall be made whole."

   51. 52. And when He came into the house, He allowed no man to go in
   except Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the
   maiden. And all wept, and bewailed her: but He said, Weep not; she is
   not dead, but sleeps. They were so sure she was dead that they had
   actually hired the minstrels for her funeral--so Mark tells us--and the
   pipers and the women that made those strange, Oriental lamentations
   were there, ready to bury her.

   53, 54. And they laughed Him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. And
   He put them out, and took her by the hand, and called saying, Little
   girl, arise.But Christ put them all out. They laughed Him to scorn and,
   therefore, He would not work the miracle in their presence. It is not
   meet to cast pearls before swine!

   55. And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and He
   commanded to give her food.Do note here the word, "straightway." Just
   now we had the word, immediately, and now we have, straightway. It is
   one of the distinguishing features of the Gospel, both of Mark and of
   Luke, that both Evangelists use the word "eutheos," "straightway."
   Christ's miracles do not take a long time to do--they are done
   straightway! If there is a distressed soul here, now, your salvation
   need not take months and years--it may be done today, and in a moment
   you may be able to rejoice that your sins are forgiven, and that you
   are a child of God! "She arose straightway, and He commanded to give
   her food." There are no unnecessary miracles. It needed a miracle to
   give her life, but food could sustain it and, therefore, there is no
   further miracle performed.

   56. And her parents were astonished: but He charged them that they
   should tell no man what was done.But we know from another Evangelist
   that the same thereof went abroad everywhere and, indeed, the healing
   of a soul is not a thing to be kept secret--but when any are raised
   from the dead the world must know it!

A Sad Confession

   (No. 3530)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "We hid, as it were, our faces from Him." Isaiah 53:3.

   You will find in the margin of some of your Bibles that this passage is
   rendered, "He hid, as it were, His face from us." The literal
   translation of the Hebrew would be, "He was as a hiding of faces from
   him," or, "from us." Some critical readers think these words were
   intended to describe our Lord as having so humbled Himself and brought
   Himself to such a deep degradation, that He was comparable to the leper
   who covered his face and cried, "Unclean, unclean!" hiding himself from
   the gaze of men. Abhorred and despised of men, he was like one put
   aside because of his disease, and shunned by all mankind. Others
   suppose the meaning to be that on account of our Lord's terrible and
   protracted sorrow, His face wore an expression so painful and grievous
   that men could scarcely bear to look upon Him. They hid, as it were,
   their faces from Him--amazed at that brow all carved with lines of
   anxious thought, those cheeks all plowed with furrows of deep care,
   those eyes all sunk in shades of sadness--that soul bowed down,
   exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death! It may be so. We cannot tell.
   So let it pass. I have a plain, practical purpose to pursue. Here is an
   indictment to which we must all plead guilty. Let us make the
   reflection our own, as we humbly bow at the dear pierced feet of our
   Lord and remember how cruelly we slighted our kindest Friend, when, "We
   hid, as it were, our faces from Him."

   At sundry times and in divers manners we may have done this. Where
   shall I begin? Alas, I fear that contempt and contumely, alone, will
   interpret some men's sayings and doings. Their conversation is so
   profane that their crime becomes indisputable. Sometimes men hide their
   faces from Jesus--

   I. IN COOL CONTEMPT OF HIM.

   How astounding! How revolting! He, the Lord of Glory, the Creator of
   Heaven and earth, out of compassion to the children of men,
   condescended to take upon Himself our nature! Should we, therefore,
   slight Him? Being found in fashion as a Man, He was subjected to all
   the pains and miseries of this mortal life and encountered the horrors
   of death, itself--should we, therefore, revile, or should we not revere
   Him? He ought surely to be esteemed by all mankind! I have sometimes
   felt that had He not redeemed my soul, I must reverence Him for
   redeeming others. Had I never tasted of His love at all, myself, yet
   the story of His love to His enemies is such that I think I could fall
   down and worship Him! His Character claims our admiration and appeals
   to the most tender feelings of our heart. So disinterested was the love
   of Christ, so self-denying, so unwavering in its constancy, He
   surpassed every instance on record and excelled any ideal that the most
   gifted imagination could paint!

   Greater love has no man than this, that he laid down his life for his
   friends. There, creature generosity exhausts itself! Mere human love
   has reached its limit! But God commends His love toward us in that,
   while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. And this blessed Man,
   Christ Jesus, personally shows and makes evident this love to His
   enemies, His persecutors, His murderers! Still there are those who can
   revile His name while they scan His history. We can scarcely speak of
   Him but forthwith the vials of their wrath begin to distil. Strange is
   it that a fame so lively, and a name so altogether lovely should so
   commonly set a man against his fellows and become the innocent cause of
   strife and persecution in the world! That name of Jesus--a name of
   highest heavenly Glory, a name of profound peace, a name of universal
   good will, a name to knit all mankind in one common brotherhood--has
   become, by the perversity of human nature, a by-word and a reproach!
   Their Savior in every age they have not known! Their day of visitation
   they have not heeded! Hence His name has excited wrath and opposition
   among the sons of men, where it should have excited reverence and love!
   Some show their opposition by attempting to ignore or to tarnish the
   dignity of His Person. These blatant infidels, I trust, are

   getting fewer and fewer. The rough, bullying speech of Tom Paine we
   sincerely hope will never be heard on earth again! There are thinkers
   (as they would have us call them) abroad in these days more courteous
   in their address and far more cautious in their language, than the
   disbelievers of former times--but too often they are as full of
   malignity and deadly venoms against the Christ of God as were the
   coarsest scoffers who uttered their blasphemy before we were born--so
   persistently is the Person of Christ held in contempt alike by Greek
   and barbarian!

   And are there not others who affect great admiration for Jesus of
   Nazareth as an example of virtue and benevolence, who, nevertheless,
   reject His mediatorial work as our Redeemer? As a substitutionary
   Sacrifice they do not and cannot esteem Him! Isaiah, in the Chapter
   before us, was holding up Christ as the Lamb led to the slaughter, the
   Victim of our transgressions, bearing our chastisement. How the anger
   of some men kindles at this representation of the Gospel! They sneer at
   the Doctrine of Substitution, Vicarious Sacrifice, Atonement--at the
   simple fact, indeed, that, "His own Self bore our sins in His own body
   on the tree." That He was a true Philanthropist, an admirable Teacher
   and an Inspired Prophet, they will readily allow--but that our
   iniquities were laid on Him, that He was punished in our place, that He
   died, the Just for the unjust--they set aside as though it were an idle
   tale, a baseless fiction! This noblest of all Doctrines, the grandest
   of all conceptions is here brought down to the humblest capacity of the
   most simple understanding. The learned can find no flaw in the logic.
   But learning and logic have little enough to do with it. The heart that
   believes it, can tell its worth--"He loved me and gave Himself for me."
   Angels have but to hear of it, and they sing of it! Marvel of marvels
   that there should be men on earth so wise that they hoot at it and
   count it worthy of nothing but their scorn! They hide, as it were,
   their faces from the Crucified Savior.

   And then they will pour contempt upon other Doctrines of His Gospel.
   Not satisfied with opposing the main and cardinal Truth of God, they
   will hold up other parts of Revelation to ridicule. If a man likes to
   laugh, and wishes to scoff, he can find folly in Infinite Wisdom. No,
   he can, if he has eyes that are full enough of lies, discover faults
   even in the Immaculate God, Himself! Given but the desire to deride and
   parody, the occasions and opportunities will always be plentiful. And
   with what pitiful disdain the Lord's people are slighted! The followers
   of Christ are, as it is commonly said, poor people--illiterate and
   uninstructed--and but few of the great ones of the earth, or the
   learned men, will give their names as adherents of the Savior! Well, so
   it always has been! And yet the day shall come when the Lord shall
   vindicate His own election and prove how infinitely superior it is to
   man's reputation! What though He choose the base things of the world
   and the things that are not, yet by these will He be exalted when His
   enemies are rolled in the dust!

   Do I address anybody who has despised the Lord Jesus Christ? Ah, my
   Friend, little do you consider what you have done! Your wantonness can
   offer no excuse but your ignorance. And as for your ignorance, it is
   without excuse! You are unacquainted with our Lord, or you would not
   decry Him. Think, I pray you! Have you really studied His Character?
   Have you looked into the proofs of His being the Messiah? Have you
   weighed the evidence of His Divinity? If you have not, surely you
   should be ashamed of your recklessness! Can it be that out of mere
   prejudice you have condemned One who, to us, is all our hope? One who
   has lifted some of us out of despair and given us peace of mind? One
   who is now so dear to us that we feel we could cheerfully die for Him?
   Do not affront Him! Do not disparage His claim upon our tender regard!
   Do not speak ill of His blessed name! He is a Friend to some of us, the
   like of whom we never found elsewhere! Were it not wiser and fitter
   every way, that you should listen to our testimony and go to Him--and
   see whether He cannot and whether He will not save you and make you
   partakers of our joy? If He rejects you, or if you find Him false to
   His promises, then speak against Him! But we beseech you, do not begin
   to rail before you have any reason! He that builds upon this Stone
   builds securely, but alas, for the man that falls foul of this Stone,
   it will assuredly grind him to powder! As surely as Christ is God,
   those who oppose Him will one day wonder and perish! The peril is
   looming as the day is coming. The glorious apocalypse for which saints
   look will bring about a total eclipse of everyone that is proud and
   lofty, everything that is high and lifted up! I will not linger on so
   dreadful a subject, but I earnestly admonish you to lay it to heart!

   A second and far more common way in which men hide their faces from
   Christ is-- II. BY THEIR HEEDLESSNESS, THEIR INDIFFERENCE, THEIR
   NEGLECT.

   Alas, all of us are guilty, or have been guilty in this respect. Allow
   me to ask you, my beloved Friends in Christ, to look back a little
   while to the period before your conversion. Was not Jesus as worthy of
   your love, then, as He is now, as glorious, as admirable? And yet for
   how long a time did you hide your face from Him! Surely you must
   remember the

   days gone by when you did not care even to hear about Him! Any kind of
   amusement was more fascinating for you than discourse or converse
   concerning your Savior and your King! There is music in His name
   now--it was dull enough to you once. You heard sermons without heeding
   them. Perhaps some of you were compelled by force of circumstance to
   attend the sanctuary, though no part of the service was attuned to your
   taste. You mixed with the multitude, but you did not see or draw near
   the Master. They were dreary hours--you were glad when they were spent
   and you were liberated! You listened, but what came in at one ear went
   out at the other. Scarcely that, for you did not allow it to go far
   enough into your brain for that! Listlessly you listened, with no
   desire to learn anything about that Christ who is your only true
   Savior, your only rightful Sovereign. If you had been in the market and
   someone had been describing the prices of goods, telling you of the
   probabilities of a rise or fall, you would have been all attention and
   you would have no difficulty in carrying home the bulk of what you had
   heard, especially that part which was about your own business! But oh,
   in those days Christ was nothing to you! The preacher might lift Him up
   with all his might and tell you with tears that if you rejected Him,
   you must perish. You took no heed. You did not care whether you
   perished or not! You did not give Christ a thought. He was put before
   you, but you hid, as it were, your faces from Him!

   Although the Bible was in your house, bearing witness to Jesus Christ,
   you never searched it. You may have taken the Book down sometimes and
   read a Chapter here, or picked out a verse there, and congratulated
   yourself not a little upon your good deed--but as to searching the
   Scriptures through and comparing passage with passage, spiritual things
   with spiritual, that you might know Jesus Christ, who is hidden there
   like a pearl in the field--oh, no, you did not care to give any
   diligence in this matter! Why, some of you young men were studying hard
   years ago! You rose up early and sat up late over professional and
   profound books and, truly, if you were to be proficient in your secular
   calling, you had need to do so. But all that while you never sat up an
   hour later than usual to make a search concerning your soul and the
   Lord who bought it with His blood! Neither did you ever rise from your
   soft couch at daylight on purpose that you might bow the knee and seek
   your Lord and worship Him. No, everything was sought except the Savior,
   every duty you would scrupulously fulfill except that which you owed
   your Lord--all the world was fair except the Altogether Lovely! And,
   perhaps, at that very time there were pursuits that gratified you
   utterly unworthy of your preference! You had loves which have proved
   bitterness to you--things that fascinated your heart that did but
   degrade you. He was your best Friend--He who only meant you good, He
   who elevates the man that does but look to Him, He whose very name
   fills the soul with refreshment, He, the love of whose Person is Heaven
   begun--He was all this while cast into the background!

   I am not speaking of you, my Friends, as if you had a monopoly of
   reproach. I speak of myself with many deep regrets of heart. I hid, as
   it were, my face from Him, and I let the years run round not without
   twitches of conscience--not without rebukes, when I knew how much I
   needed a Savior, not without the warnings which came from others whom I
   saw happy and rejoicing in Christ, while I had no share in His
   salvation! Still I put it off, as perhaps some of you are doing, from
   day to day, and month to month, and thought that Christ might come in
   some odd hour and when I had nothing else to do I might think of Him,
   whose blood could cleanse me! O my Soul, I could gladly smite you now!
   I have heard of a minister who preached for several years before he was
   converted, and when converted he became a very earnest preacher of the
   Gospel. But one day as he rode along the street, he was observed to
   stop and cane a dog which was lying in front of a door. When they said
   to him, "Mr. McPhayle, why did you beat the dog?" He said, "He was so
   exactly like myself, lying in the sun sleeping--a dumb dog that didn't
   bark--that I could not but give him a touch of the rod, though I meant
   it all the while for myself." Truly I could lay this rod about my own
   heart to think that weeks and weeks should have rolled over my head and
   I should have hid, as it were, my face from Christ in willful neglect
   of my dear Lord, whose heart has bled for me! Does not this come home
   to anybody here? Are there not some who might justly chastise
   themselves?

   But we pass on to a third form of this same folly. We hid, as it were,
   our faces from Him, many of us-- III. BY PREFERRING ANY OTHER MODE OF
   SALVATION TO SALVATION BY FAITH IN CHRIST. The great Gospel fact is
   that whoever looks to Christ is saved. The moment Faith, with her
   intelligent eyes, beholds Christ on the Cross and depends on Him, the
   man that exercises that faith is forgiven, rescued, saved! Now when we
   were awakened to something like anxiety about our souls, we were told
   this. Some of us were told it very plainly, others perhaps not quite so
   clearly, but we did not like this way of being saved, simply by
   believing! Did not we try to merit salvation by our own good works? Oh,
   we would do this, and that, and the other! We would correct ourselves
   in this depart-

   ment, and we would push on and make progress in the other--or at least
   we triedto do so. Oh, I could pour scorn upon myself to think of some
   of the good resolutions I made! I blew them up like children with their
   pipes and their soap. Fine bubbles they were, reflecting all the colors
   of the rainbow. But a touch and they dissolved! They were good for
   nothing--poor stuff to build eternal hopes upon! Oh, that working of
   ours! What slavery it was, but what small results it produced! We came
   to grief whenever we began to get a little comfortable with ourselves.
   Just when we said, "Now my tower will stand," there came an earthquake
   and it all went to a heap of ruins. Then, if we remember well, we tried
   our feelings--we said, "It cannot be that if I believe in Jesus just as
   I am, I shall be saved--I must felsomething." How we resorted to sharp
   books, terrible sketches of death, judgment and perdition--I know I
   did. Baxter's Call to the Uncon-vertedcut me to the quick and harrowed
   up my gloomiest apprehensions. We expected to feel something
   indescribable, and when we began to feel a little alarm and distress of
   mind, we found it was not the thing that brought satisfaction to the
   mind, or peace to the heart, for the more we did feel, the less we
   thought we felt! And the more we felt, the less we considered our
   feelings to be of the right kind! So, after tossing, and toiling, and
   rowing with feelings, we found we had got no farther than we did with
   works! And all this while there stood the Savior with this simple
   counsel, "Look unto Me and be you saved, all you ends of the earth."

   Still, we wrapped ourselves in our mantle and hid, as it were, our
   faces from Him. We kept looking at ourselves and enquiring in the
   biographies of good men after this feeling and after the other, while
   we hid, as it were, our faces from Him! And when we were beaten off
   from that false refuge, we took to a fresh conceit. Thinking we could
   pray ourselves into Heaven, we began to pray! This would have been
   quite right had not we put the exercise of prayer before the
   commandment to believe. "He that believes and is baptized shall be
   saved"--that is the Gospel! We were reluctant to surrender ourselves to
   an implicit confidence in our Lord. We resolved to pray. Prayer seemed
   to us a proper performance-- a religious duty acceptable to God and
   much to be commended. We did not understand that we must first be
   quickened into life before we could breathe freely. Looking upon daily
   prayer as a kind of ecclesiastical exercise, albeit there was no real
   heart in it, we thought some good would come of making it a habit. But
   no good came! Our prayers became a form, and we disquieted ourselves in
   vain. We found we could not pray. Oh, what fools we were! What fools
   all of us are to look anywhere for salvation but to Jesus Christ! God
   the Father has set forth Christ to be a Propitiation for sin. If God
   has done that, cannot I be content? If the Lord has accepted Christ
   instead of me, and promised that if I believe in Jesus I shall be
   saved, why need I go about to find some other way of peace, pardon and
   full salvation? Is not God's way good enough for me? If God accepts it,
   why should not I rejoice in it? Oh, dear Friends, if we have been
   covering our faces, let us uncover them right now! And if they are
   black as soot with sin, let us just look up to the Cross with a black
   face, and say, "Savior of sinners, I, the very chief among them, put my
   sole trust in You! Hiding my eyes no more from the Light of God, I will
   look to You and trust You with all my heart."

   In yet another way we hid our faces from Him. After we were quite sure
   that we could not be saved other than by the one Mediator, do you
   remember how we continued to hide our face from Jesus--

   IV. BY PERSISTENT UNBELIEF IN HIM?

   I know it for myself. I held up the handkerchief before my eyes,
   saturated with my own tears. This sympathy for our sorrows I could not
   credit. It is the sullen sulk of sad souls. Their distress of mind has
   come between them and the Redeemer. Strange to tell, some men will
   reason against themselves. No doubt if there were a gift to be bestowed
   upon all the poor people in the parish, everybody who needed anything
   would try to prove himself to be in the parish. If there were a man who
   lived with half his house in one parish and half in another, I'll be
   bound to say he would try to prove he lived in the parish where the
   gifts were to be had! But somehow or other, awakened sinners try to
   prove that they are notthe sort of people Christ died for! They used to
   have in Rome, when they were canonizing saints, an Advocatus Diaboli,
   or advocate of the devil, who used to plead against the person being
   canonized and offer all the objections he could. It seems strange that
   so many people should turn Advocati Diaboli against themselves! I can
   tell you how they argue, for I have talked with them by the hour, and
   this has been the fashion of their counterpleading--"But, Sir, I
   don'tfeel my need of it." We reply, "If you cannot go to Christ with a
   broken heart, go to Christ fora broken heart." "Oh, but, Sir, I don t
   feel that I am fit to go." "Your unfitness is the only evidence He
   needs." "But I don't think I have repented enough." "Granted. And you
   never will repent enough, could your tears flow forever. You cannot be
   saved by the merit of your repentance. Jesus Christ will forgive your
   impenitence as well as your other sins. Certainly if you need more
   repentance,

   you must go to Him for it." "Well, but, Sir, do you know I cannot help
   fearing that perhaps I am not one of the elect?" We have replied,
   "Perhaps you are. And anyhow, you had better go to Christ, because He
   has given an invitation to every creature. He says, 'Whoever will, let
   him come and take of the water of life freely.'" "Ah, Sir, but you
   don't know--I am so indifferent." "Well, but you will never be
   otherwise than indifferent as long as you stay away from the Savior. If
   you go to Him and put your trust in Him, He will remove your
   indifference. He alone can roll away this stone from the door of your
   heart." One moment they will say they do not feel--and almost in the
   same breath they will turn round and say they feel the horrors of
   despair! When they tell you of the dreadful blasphemies that come into
   their mind, you may answer that it is written, "All manner of sin and
   of blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, and whoever believes in Him is
   not condemned," feel, or notfeel as he may!

   Well, I have pursued that business till I have been pretty nearly tired
   of it, when all of a sudden the person I have been trying to comfort
   has begun again where he commenced, as if he had never said those
   things before! He has gone over the same round of objections and I
   have, no doubt, would have continued to repeat himself, had I continued
   to answer him, 50 times over! And so did he encourage the morbid
   apprehension that he could not, himself, be saved. You see a man put
   into the condemned cell at Newgate and you go in and tell him that Her
   Majesty presents him with a free pardon. I guarantee you he will not
   put his hand to his brow and say, "Well, but I think there is this or
   that objection to my accepting it." "No," he thinks, "if there is any
   objection, let those find it out that like--it is no business of mine."
   And so with the soul that is bid to come to Christ! I say, let it come,
   objections or no objections, and if there are objections, let somebody
   else find them out, but as for you, poor Sinner, don't cover your face
   from Jesus, but come as you are, just as you are, and say, "Here I am,
   my Savior! If You can, save--and I believe You can--save me! At any
   rate, if I perish, I will perish trusting in You." Rather, Sinner,
   shall Heaven and earth pass away than even a soul perish that acts on
   this firm resolve! Hide not your eyes from the Savior! It is a dreadful
   temptation of Satan, this mistaken notion of humility. People think, or
   affect to think, that it would be arrogant or presumptuous on their
   part to believe in Jesus. I tell you solemnly that unbelief is not
   humility! It is a foul conceit. Humility trusts the Savior. Base,
   indeed, is the ingratitude which casts a slur upon His truthfulness and
   refrains from venturing to accept His promises! Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, we once hid, as it were, our faces from Him--let us pray for
   others who are hiding their faces--and beseech the Lord to incline them
   to turn their faces right round to His dear Cross, and then let us
   gently take off the mantle that obscures their vision, and say to them,
   "Look, look through your tears! Look even now, for there is life in a
   look at the Crucified One."

   But not to tarry, I am afraid there are some of us who must plead
   guilty to another charge. We have hidden, as it were, our faces from
   Him since He has saved us, and since we have known His love--

   V. BY OUR SILLY SHAME AND OUR BASE COWARDICE.

   Perhaps I speak to some Christians here, who, though they love the
   Lord, have never professed His name! Dear Brother, dear Sister, do you
   think this is right--is it loyal? Had He kept His love to you a secret
   and never openly espoused your cause, and given up Himself for your
   salvation, where would you now have been? Howbeit He boldly declared He
   was not ashamed to call us "brethren," and, true to His word, He acted
   a brother's part and carried through the work of our Redemption! Since
   Jesus Christ was not ashamed of us, surely we need never be ashamed of
   Him! "But I think I may go to Heaven by myself," said one, "for I am
   afraid I shall compromise other people if I dishonor Christ." And do
   you not think, my dear Brother, that you are dishonoring Him by such a
   suggestion? "Oh, but suppose I were to fall into sin?" Do you not think
   that even now you are living in sin while you are refusing what He
   demands, that you should confess Him before men? His promise is that he
   that with his heart believes, and with his mouth makes the good
   confession, shall be saved. Or, as it is put in another form, we read,
   "He that believes and is baptized" (which is the open confession of
   Him) "shall be saved." Do not, I entreat you, play the coward! "Suppose
   I should fall," you ask, "after I have made a profession?" Which do you
   think the safer place--where your Lord bids you, or where you choose to
   be yourself? Come forward if you are His followers and put on His
   regimentals. I wonder what our Government would say if Her Majesty's
   soldiers were to take off their red coats and protest, "We should be
   just as good soldiers, and as true, without this uniform, as with it."
   They would be suspected of treason! They would be taken up as deserters
   And are there no deserters here? I would like to send the officer round
   and find you out--

   "Are you the soldiers of the Cross, The followers of the Lamb?

   How can you blush to acknowledge His cause, Or fear to speak His
   Name?''

   Come out Brothers and Sisters, come out! If you want your Master's
   blessing, come and join your Master's servants! Yes, but some of us who
   have made a profession of our faith may, nevertheless, have sometimes
   hid our faces from Christ--

   VI. BY COWARDICE.

   Have you ever been in company where religion was jested at and felt,
   "Well, I had better hold my tongue here"? There are seasons when that
   is prudent, and even proper--when you are so weak a champion that you
   might damage the cause. At the same time, even the weakest champion had
   better have his lance broken than be altogether a coward! How often
   might we have spoken for Jesus when nothing has kept us back except
   cowardice? It was not prudence--it was cowardice, downright cowardice!
   We thought they would give us a bad name, and so we dishonored Christ
   lest we should encounter a rude joke or a coarse jest from a person
   whose opinion was never worthy of a moment's thought! I wish there were
   more boldness for Christ everywhere. In the higher circles he that
   confesses Christ may have to run the gauntlet for it, but let him do so
   boldly! And among working men in the shop or factory there is a deal of
   "chaffing" goes on, often of a cruel kind, against the Christian, but
   he who is such a feather-bed soldier that he cannot bear the reproach
   is not worthy of such a Lord! Our sires were not so tame that they
   could be intimidated with a taunt. They never drew back at the stake,
   or in the fire! They were ready to die for the Lord Jesus. What do you
   think, then--should we play the coward-- shall a little maid make us
   afraid, or shall some silly fools who scoff at all that is holy, drive
   us to disown our Savior? Oh, Brothers and Sisters, do not surrender
   your souls so cheaply! Never mind their sneers! Never hide your face
   from Him. Come out and have no fellowship with the profane, the
   profligate, or the persecutors. Is Christ in the pillory? Put me in
   with Him, and then throw what you like at me! Is Christ's name rolled
   in the mud, and made a by-word and a proverb? Link my name with His and
   make a by-word and a proverb of it! Twist the two together and let us
   be the object of your slanders. I will glory in it! The reproach of
   Christ is greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt! Hide not,
   then, your faces from Him, Beloved, nor shrink from espousing His
   cause!

   I feel sure that many, if not all of us, who are Believers will
   penitently confess that we have sometimes hidden our faces from
   Christ--

   VII. BY NOT WALKING IN CONSTANT FELLOWSHIP WITH HIM.

   I once asked a Brother how long it was since he had enjoyed fellowship
   with Jesus. His reply was remarkable. "I feel sorry," he said, "you
   have asked me that question, and yet I must thank you. Had you asked me
   whether I continued in prayer, I would have said 'Yes,' for, with more
   or less fervor, I do constantly pray. Had you inquired whether I
   endeavored to walk honestly and uprightly before my fellow creatures, I
   would have said, 'Yes, thank God I hope I have not slipped with my
   feet.' But when you say, 'How long is it since you really have had
   fellowship with Jesus?' I blush to admit that many a day has passed
   since I have known this high privilege." Is that so with you, my dear
   Brothers and Sisters in Christ? If so, it is very, very sad. Our heart,
   if we are Christians, is married to Christ. Say, then, would it not be
   strange if a wife should live with her husband and hide her face from
   him by the week and month together? Should there be scarcely a
   comfortable word between them? Should there only be just the decent
   civilities of a daily routine, without much concern or any confiding?
   Yet perhaps some of you pray a little every morning and every night
   because you think it is proper. At special times you do your reverence
   to Christ and then you go out into the world, and there, in a measure,
   you estrange yourselves from Him. And then you return home, far from
   being eager and anxious for communion with your Lord--so, not seeking
   His face for yourselves--you do, in effect, hide your face from Him.
   There is no face to face fellowship. Remember, I entreat you, that His
   love to you is constant, although your love to Christ may grow cold. If
   you can dispense with His company, remember that He delights in
   yourcompany! There it stands in the Canticles, "Let Me see your face.
   Let Me hear your voice, for sweet is your voice and your countenance is
   comely." Now had you said that to Christ, it might be easily
   understood, but when He says that to you, it is most admirable! His
   love makes Him desire to hold fellowship with you--will you refuse it?
   Will you deny Him? Surely you will say, "Do You think so much of me? I
   ought to have said to You what You have said to me, 'You have ravished
   My heart, My sister, My spouse, with one look of your eyes, and one
   chain of your neck.' No, but these are the words of Him from whom I
   have often hid my face! And is this precious Christ so enamored of me?
   Has He, the Prince of Life, so fixed His affections on my spirit? Does
   He love to hear me speak with Him? Does He delight in my communing with
   Him? Oh, then I cannot forbear! I must cry, 'Come to

   me, my Lord, and I will tell You my griefs, and my joys, and You shall
   tell me all Your heart, and we will thus confer and confide with
   secrets of which the world knows not!'"

   The secret of the Lord is with them who fear Him. Let us, therefore,
   tell our heart's love to Christ. We hid, as it were, our faces from
   Him. Say, when and how did you begin thus to act? You used to revel in
   the light of His Countenance, once--why did you hide your face? Did you
   get worldly? Did you dote too much upon some earthly object? Did you
   neglect prayer? Did you give way to temptation? Beloved, whatever may
   have been the cause, remember Jesus Christ has not divorced you! He has
   said, "Return, you backsliding children; I am married unto you, says
   the Lord." Come back then! Come back, now, as we meet around the Lord's
   Table, you that love your Lord, but have lost fellowship with Him!
   Pray--pray that this may be the beginning of a happier era. Oh, that we
   might keep looking on to Jesus, and Jesus looking to us! Oh, that we
   might maintain that dear fellowship and never have it broken till it
   shall melt into the yet nearer and more glorious communion on the other
   side of the river where nothing can disturb the profound enjoyment! Get
   up, get up, Believers, from your sorrows, from your cares, from your
   anxieties and distractions! Get up to the Master's feet and sit there
   with Mary, and look up into His dear loving face, and listen to His
   gracious words of promise! Hide not your face from Him! He will not
   hide His face from you! Say, like the spouse in the Canticles, "Let Him
   kiss me with the kisses of His mouth, for His love is better than
   wine," and He will answer your prayer, and make your heart burn within
   you with the holy ecstasy of fervent love! May it be ever so with us!
   Amen.

'That Day' and Its Disclosure"

   (No. 3531)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THURSDAY EVENING,
   FEBRUARY 15, 1872.

   "The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy from the Lord in that
   day." 2 Timothy 1:18.

   [The original title was "The Day"...]

   GRATITUDE is never failing in Christians. When they have received a
   benefit, they are sure to acknowledge it. When Paul was at Rome,
   Onesiphorus found him out very diligently, and was not ashamed of his
   chains, but ministered to his necessities and, therefore, Paul felt
   bound to him and to his family in perpetual thankfulness. Let none of
   us ever be accused of ingratitude--it is one of the worst of sins.
   Paul, no doubt, would have done all he could for Onesiphorus in other
   ways, but he added to all other ways of showing his gratitude, that of
   praying for him--praying the prayer which we have here put on record in
   the Book of Inspiration. Learn hence that if we can do nothing else for
   our benefactors, we can bless them by our prayers. Let us be abundant
   in pouring out supplications before the Throne of God for all those who
   in any way have done us a service. We also learn from the text that the
   best of men have need to be prayed for. I cannot doubt but that
   Onesiphorus was saved. He seems to have been a most decided follower of
   Christ, for when others did not know Paul because he was a prisoner,
   Onesiphorus knew him. He sought him out--he sought him out diligently--
   even into the poorest quarters of that great city of Rome. He hunted
   him out, though probably the population at that time was not less, but
   perhaps far more than four millions of people. He found the Apostle and
   he ministered unto his need. He was a good man and yet Paul prayed for
   him--prayed for him a prayer which would be appropriate for a bad man,
   too, "The Lord grant that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day!"
   The best of us needs to be prayed for! Let us be thankful if we have
   anybody to pray for us. Let us count the prayers of the faithful to be
   our truest riches. He is the happiest man who shall have the most of
   God's people lift up their hearts in prayer for him!

   I call your attention, tonight, however, to none of these surrounding
   particulars. I want to fix your minds upon one thing. I desire,
   anxiously desire, that we may all be led to look forward to that day of
   which the Apostle here speaks. And our first point shall be that day.
   Then our second point shall be the mercy of that day. First, then--

   I. "THAT DAY."

   Paul speaks of the Day of Judgment here. He does not specify it,
   because it was so commonly believed in and expected among Christians,
   that it was quite sufficient for him to say, "that day." From the
   earliest times, wherever there has been Divine Light, that day has been
   expected. Enoch, also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied concerning the
   coming of the Lord. And his prophecy, though very early, was so clear
   that the Jew, who almost closes the Book of Inspiration, quotes
   it--feeling, I suppose, that he could not use words mode expressive
   than those which came from that ancient Prophet. All along the pages of
   Scriptural history you read of men raised up to tell of "that day."
   Asaph, in the Psalm we read just now, gave a most accurate description
   of that day when the Lord shall judge His people. And Daniel, when he
   saw the Throne of God set and the Ancient of Days come, perceived that
   day for which we also are now looking. Nothing, perhaps, is more often
   spoken of in Scripture than "that day." The New Testament teems with
   allusions to that Day of Judgment, when the Lord shall be revealed with
   flaming fire. I say it was so commonly understood that Paul had no need
   to say anything except, "that day." Questions will be asked tonight by
   some, "When will that day come?" to which I would answer, it were
   better for us to be prepared for it, come when it may, than to be
   anxious to fix its date! We can give you no information, because "of
   that day and of that hour knows no man--no, not even the angels of
   Heaven." After trying to discover what I can of the future, I arrive at
   this conclusion from Scripture, that the Lord would have us be in a
   state of perpetual vigilance and expectancy and, therefore, He has
   studded the Scriptures with phrases to the effect that He comes
   quickly. Truly His, "quickly," will not be the same as ours, but I
   think the noontide of the world may have

   passed and these are the latter days--and we might to be looking for
   and hastening unto the coming of the Son of Man. He may come tomorrow!
   He may come tonight! He may delay His coming, but He shall come at such
   an hour as the mass of men think not, and at an hour when they are not
   aware! That day shall overtake them as a thief in the night, and come
   upon them as pain upon a woman in childbirth. Some may curiously ask
   whether the Day of Judgment will be a natural day or not. Will it be a
   day of 24 hours? To which we again reply, we have no information--but
   we know that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a
   thousand years as one day. It will be a definite period. Whatever its
   length or brevity, it will suffice for an accurate judgment and a
   judgment of all mankind! Whether it shall occupy a thousand years or a
   single day, the work will be done--done thoroughly, done effectually,
   done forever--for all the race of Adam. Let us rest assured of that.

   It is far more important for us to know these things about that
   day--first, that it will be ushered in as no other day has been. The
   day began in Eden with the rising sun. And when the sun's first beams
   had lit up the sky, the birds began to sing right joyously among the
   trees. But "that day" shall be ushered in, not by the rising sun, but
   by the Sun of Righteousness Himself! He shall arise with all the Glory
   of His Father and the holy angels shall come with Him. There will be
   sights and sounds on that tremendous morning such as never were seen or
   heard by mortal men before! Even Sinai's tremendous pomp, which made
   Moses fear and quake, shall be outdone in that dread day when the Lord
   shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the trumpet of the
   archangel, and with the voice of God. It will be a day of days. Its
   dreadful surroundings are spoken of in Scripture, but, after all, words
   can but feebly describe them. It will be a day especially notable for
   the Revelation of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ! As yet He is
   hidden among the sons of men. He was as one concealed incognito. He
   traveled through this world and they counted Him a Man of Sorrows and
   acquainted with grief. He has gone into His Glory, but He is concealed
   at the right hand of God from the gaze of men below. They see Him not.
   They know Him not!

   But in that day He shall sit upon the clouds of Heaven and every eye
   shall see Him--and they, also, who crucified Him. Then shall they say
   that He is Divine, and no longer shall they dare to dispute it! Then
   shall the Jew see that He is the Messiah who was to come and then shall
   the Gentile perceive that He is King of Kings and Lord of Lords! The
   flashings of His Glory shall convince all mankind--and the wicked shall
   stand speechless before His Judgment Seat! Pilate then shall not ask
   Him, "What is truth?" for he, alas, too late, shall perceive it! They
   shall bring no accusation against Him, then, for to their confusion
   they shall see that He was no traitor, but a King! Judas shall not sell
   Him, then, for he shall perceive, then, that he who sold Him was the
   son of perdition, to perish forever! Oh, what a day shall that be when,
   coming out of His chamber, rejoicing like a strong man to run a race,
   the Bridegroom of the Church shall appear, and all His saints shall
   appear with Him! It will be a day remarkable for its wonderful
   convictions. There will be a general assembly held on that day such as
   never has been held before! For, first, the Son of God shall be the
   center of all eyes, and around Him shall be His Father's angels. Heaven
   shall send her pomp to swell His train. He shall come and His saints,
   also, shall come with Him. The glorified shall come to sit with Him and
   then, as in a moment, the dead shall arise. I shall go into no minute
   questions or particulars, now, but certainly at that moment there shall
   stand upon the earth all the dead, both small and great--they that were
   on the earth buried in it and they that were in the sea shall all
   arise--and as the trumpet rings out clear and loud, the whole multitude
   of men that lived and died shall start up from their tombs to see their
   God upon His Throne! And those who are alive at that time--all shall
   come and live again--and the raised bodies of men and the spirits of
   the just! There shall come up from the infernal pit of Hell, lost
   spirits, too, and the chief foe of God and man, long scarred by
   Jehovah's lightning--he shall come and lift his brazen front once more,
   and the saints shall judge the fallen angel who long had persecuted
   them! He shall receive his final sentence and begin the utmost Hell
   which God had reserved for the devil and his angels, so that there on
   this poor planet, little compared with greater stars, and yet in God's
   sight most glorious of them all, there shall be a convocation of the
   three worlds! Heaven, Earth and Hell shall meet together, and Christ,
   in the midst of them all, shall judge the world in righteousness and
   the people with equity. Oh, what a day will that day be!

   And it will be a day, in addition to the general convocation, of
   universal excitement. Next week the day of thanksgiving will move
   London from end to end, but there will be tens of thousands to whom it
   will be no day of thanksgiving, but perhaps of bitter sorrow. There
   will be nothing that could make them thankful in the pageantry of that
   day. So of all the days that have ever happened to the sons of men,
   there have been some unmoved thereby. Let us speak as though our soul
   were in every word--some of our Hearers will slumber, or their minds
   will wander. But on that day there will be no indifferent spectators of
   that tremendous pomp! The wicked shall wake up--their indifference
   shall have gone and they shall be filled with dismay and despair! They
   shall long for annihilation! They shall ask the rocks to cover them,
   and the

   mountains to conceal them. The righteous shall not be listless, either,
   for theirs shall be boldness in the Day of Judgment, and joy, and
   triumph, and acclamations of welcome with which they shall hail the
   King of Kings sitting upon His Throne! There will be a general
   excitement. Hell will howl its loudest howl and Heaven will resound
   with its loftiest songs on that closing day of the drama of time, that
   day of which the Apostle speaks!

   And that will be a day of wondrous revelations. On that day we shall
   detect the hypocrite. See him yonder? The mask has fallen. See the
   leprosy on his brow? Then shall we see the men who were misrepresented,
   who were counted the offscouring of all things, though of them the
   world was not worthy! The filth with which men pelted them in the
   pillory of scorn shall fall off and their garments shall be whiter than
   any fuller can make them in the Glory of the Righteousness which Christ
   shall put upon them! There will be a resurrection of reputations in
   that day. And at the same time there will be the judgment of mere
   profession. Perhaps in that hour we shall understand the Providence of
   God infinitely better than we do now. Then we shall see the evil of
   men's hearts as we never saw it, for every idle word that man has
   spoken shall be published there, and transgressions of midnight that
   were covered up with curtains of lies shall suddenly stand revealed as
   in the noonday sun--and the men who scorned the righteous and were
   themselves guilty of abominable sin! Oh, what a revealing day! The
   housetops, then, shall ring with secrets that have been hidden in the
   closet, and men shall read the writing, as it were, upon the sky, the
   dark sayings and the hidden things which were of old.

   And then when the revealing shall have come, it will be a day of final
   judgment. From almost any court on earth there is an appeal. Even after
   the judge puts on the black cap and condemns the criminal, he yet
   appeals to public opinion and to the mercy from the nation, and perhaps
   an unworthy life may yet be spared. But from that Judgment Seat there
   shall be no appeal! Forever and forever fixed is the fate of men whom
   Christ has judged. "He that is filthy, let him be filthy, still, and he
   that is unrighteous let him be unrighteous still." No change can take
   place, and no appeal can ever be made. 'Tis done, 'tis sealed, 'tis
   inevitable. 'Tis over forever and forever--forever saved, or forever
   lost! That day, then, ought to be a matter of personal interest to
   everyone of my Hearers, yes, and to everyone beneath the sun. It will
   be the last day of time! Then there will be no more counting of rising
   and setting suns, no reckoning by waxing and waning moons. Then there
   will be no revolutions of the year to mark the period of time, nor will
   men count by centuries. It shall be eternity--one ocean of eternity
   without landmarks by which to say, "Thus far have we gone, and thus far
   have we yet to go." Oh, wondrous day! Oh! marvelous day! The last day
   of time, a day forever to be remembered--remembered by the wicked in
   Hell, to whom it shall be said, "Son, remember," and remembered, I
   think, by the righteous in Heaven forever, for they shall look back to
   that day when Christ appeared and they were declared to be the blessed
   of the Father to inherit the Kingdom prepared for them from before the
   foundation of the world! Oh, how I blame my tongue and chide myself
   that I cannot speak upon this theme as I would, but nevertheless may
   the solemn facts make up for my lack of speech and may they tell upon
   your souls! Now I must turn to the second point, and speak upon-- II.
   THE MERCY OF THAT DAY.

   The mercy which is prayed for in this verse, "The Lord grant unto him
   that he may find mercy from the Lord in that day." Will that prayer be
   heard? Will that prayer be heard for me, for you, each one of you in
   this area, in these galleries? Will God have mercy on you in that day?
   I will tell you--

   First, He will have no mercy in that day upon those who had no mercy
   upon others. If you cannot forgive, neither shall you be forgiven! If
   you cannot kneel down and sincerely pray, "Forgive us our debts as we
   forgive them that are indebted to us," then the gates of Heaven are
   fast barred against you! If you take your brother by the throat and
   say, "Pay me what you owe me," the great Master of us all will commit
   you to the tormentors, because your great debt has not been paid!
   Relentless, malicious, revengeful men, take heed of that! Lay it on
   your pillow tonight and let it pierce your heart--if you forgive not
   every man his brother, your heavenly Father will not forgive you!

   Next, God will have no mercy in that day upon those who lived and died
   in wickedness. Here is the proof of it, "The wicked shall be turned
   into Hell," and Hell means not mercy, but misery! The men that have
   lied in the breaking of God's Law from day to day, from childhood to
   manhood, perhaps from manhood to old age, and have died still
   sinning--for them there shall be no mercy whatever! There shall be no
   mercy for those who neglect salvation. Again I give you God's words for
   it, "How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?" These
   people had not done any particular mischief to anybody else. They had
   not persecuted Christ. They had not reviled His Gospel. They had not
   been heretics--they simply neglected the matter. "How shall you escape
   if you neglect so great a salvation?" You shall not escape at all! If
   you neglect His mercy, here, mercy will neglect you forever!

   Then, again, they shall have no mercy who said they needed none. Are
   there not some here who fancy that they need no mercy from God? They do
   their best. They are excellent in character. They are well deserving
   and they expect to enter

   into Heaven through their good deeds. You seek no mercy, you shall have
   none! You proudly reject it. You trust to your own righteousness--you
   seek to have what you merit--you shall have what you merit--but that
   will be to be driven forever from the Presence of God! There cannot be
   mercy to those who will not confess that they need mercy. There shall
   be no mercy in that day for those who sought no mercy here. Prayerless
   souls? You are graceless souls and mercy shall be denied you then! You
   will pray loudly enough then! Oh, how they pray in Hell! What tears and
   groans send they up to Heaven! They would gladly have mercy there, but
   Mercy's day is over--Justice has turned the key and hurled that key
   into the abyss where it can never be found! They are prisoners forever
   beneath the wrath of God! They who will not ask for it deserve not to
   have it. When mercy is to be had for the asking, if man turns upon his
   heels and refuses to ask, what shall God do but say, "Because I called
   and you refused--I stretched out My hand and no man regarded--I also
   will mock at your calamity. I will laugh when your fear comes"? There
   shall be no mercy for those who ask no mercy.

   Further, there shall in that day be no mercy for those that scoffed at
   Christ, denied His dignity, railed at His people, broke His Sabbath and
   altogether abhorred His Gospel. Oh, Sirs, you fight a desperate battle
   against Him who made the heavens and the earth and who is the darling
   Son of God! In fighting against Christ, you dash yourselves upon the
   bosses of Jehovah's buckler! You cast yourselves upon the point of His
   spear! Be wise and stop your rebellion. "Kiss the Son lest He be angry,
   and you perish from the way when His wrath is kindled but a little."
   How shall the wax contend with the fire, or the thistles wage war with
   the flames? Yet you are doing this, O you that rebel against Christ!
   You shall either break or bow. Bow, I pray you, for if not, He shall
   break you with a rod of iron! He shall break you in pieces like a
   potter's vessel. Beware, you that despise Him, lest in the day of His
   coming He despises your image and you utterly perish.

   There shall in that day be no mercy for those who refuse the Gospel.
   And I am sorry to say there are some here of that sort. Those cannot be
   said to refuse the Gospel who do not know it, but most of you do know
   it. I was thinking this afternoon, as I prayed God to let this subject
   get into my own soul, about some of you who do not lack for light and
   instruction, who do not need to know more about the way of salvation,
   or about the penalty of neglecting it. What you need is a new heart and
   a right spirit! You need your will subdued! You need decision of
   character! You need to be made thoughtful--you need to be made
   prayerful! I cannot do this for you, but I can warn you over and over
   and over again that they who go to Hell from under the shadow of the
   pulpit wherein there is an earnest ministry, go there with an emphasis!
   They that fall from the heights of privilege fall, indeed, into the
   Lake of Fire! God grant that not a solitary one of the many hearers who
   gather here may know what it is to have it said, "It shall be more
   tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment than for you. They
   would have repented had they heard the Gospel, but you heard it and
   repented

   not."

   I must add to all this that there shall be no mercy in that day for
   those who have sold their Lord. "Where are they?" you ask. "Does there
   live on this earth a miscreant who has sold his Lord?" God have mercy
   on the man--he not only lives on earth, but he is here! He was once a
   professor, but he found it more profitable to cease from religion, and
   he has done so. He once came to the Communion Table, but he fell into
   lustful habits and he is no member of Christ. He has defiled the Temple
   of God--and God shall destroy him! He could sometimes pray in
   public--at the Prayer Meeting, but he dares not pray now--he has enough
   conscience left to let him cede from such hypocrisy! He sold his Lord
   for pleasure. He sold his Lord for money. He sold his Lord for the fear
   of man. "Verily I say unto you, he who is ashamed of Me and My Word, of
   him will I be ashamed when I shall come in the Glory of My Father and
   all My holy angels with Me." You know who spoke those words! They were
   spoken by Him whose hands were pierced! He has said it, and oh, note,
   you apostates, note it well, "He that denies Me before men, him will I
   deny before My Father who is in Heaven. Verily I say unto you, I never
   knew you! Depart from Me, you workers of iniquity." Oh, where is this
   unhappy man? May God have mercy on him, tonight, for He will have no
   mercy upon him in that day if he dies as he now is!

   And I shall close that list by saying in that day God will have no
   mercy for false professors. He will have no mercy upon preachers who
   could talk glibly, but whose lives were not consistent with their own
   teaching. What a condemnation shall await me if I am not found in
   Christ after having preached so continuously to so many thousands! Oh,
   whatever a man shall be in Hell, may God grant he may never be an
   unfaithful minister of Christ, condemned out of his own mouth! But what
   shall I say of unfaithful deacons and Elders, and Church members? Their
   condemnation will be as just as it is terrible! Why needed they to add
   to their other sins the sin of a false profession? If they loved not
   Christ they need not have been traitors. There was no necessity for
   them to come forward and be baptized into the Triune name! There was no
   demand upon them to come to the Table in remembrance of Christ's death
   if they were not His! They voluntarily thrust themselves into a
   profession which was a lie and into the midst of a Church with which
   they were not akin. Surely if He begins first at the House of God, His
   judgments will be most terrible upon false professors! For this chaff
   there shall

   be the unquenchable fire, for it was once upon the Lord's threshing
   floor! For this dross there shall be consuming flames, for it was once
   in alliance with the precious gold which the King calls His own. I feel
   inclined to stop preaching and to pray for myself. The Lord have mercy
   upon me in that day! And then to take you all by name, if I could know
   you all, one by one, and kneel here and say, "The Lord have mercy upon
   this man--this woman--this child--in that day." But I beg you pray it
   for yourselves! Now, in the silence of your souls, let this prayer go
   up vehemently to Heaven, "O God, have mercy upon me! Have mercy upon me
   in that day and to that end have mercy upon me now."

   I close, but I never like to close a sermon when it looks like
   Jeremiah's roll--written inside and outside with lamentations. Let us
   have a sweet word or two to finish with. We spoke of that day--for a
   moment let me speak of thisday-- of this day! You have not come to that
   day yet. Today it is not judgment, but love that rules the hour. Now
   the Great White Throne is not yet set, neither is there a trumpet that
   rings in your ears, but it is an affectionate voice which speaks to you
   and says, "Mercy is still to be had! Mercy is to be had by false
   professors! Mercy is to be had by apostates! Mercy is to be had by the
   very chief of sinners!" This is a night, this very night, in which
   prayer will be answered! God has said, "Seek and you shall find." This
   is a night in which Christ waits to be gracious! He is exalted on high
   on purpose to give repentance unto Israel, and remission of sins. This
   is a night in which sin may be forgiven! You are on praying ground--
   you are still on pleading terms! The sentence is not passed. The wax is
   still melted and it is not stamped and cold. There is hope for you!
   Better than that, there are kind invitations for you--there are loving
   exhortations! How long these may stand good, I cannot tell. As far as
   any one of us may be concerned, the Judgment Day may come tomorrow. It
   may come to all mankind--but as far as the practical fact is
   concerned--it may come in death to any one of us tonight. I look round
   me, now, and I remember a month ago certain seats in this place that
   were occupied by those that are now gone-- gone to their account. If it
   were right, I think I could point my finger to some of you that are
   sitting in the places of dead men. They were their seats. They used to
   sit there, some of them, and they rejoiced in every word they heard! Is
   a sinner filling a saint's place?

   There are some, again, that are gone out of this company who gave us no
   evidence of Grace. Alas, is there no sinner sitting in the place where
   one sat before him who forgot God? You are all passing away--I am
   passing with you. We are all shadows. We fly like an arrow through the
   air. We are a wind that passes and it is not. Oh, make sure of eternal
   things, Brothers and Sisters! Whatever you lose, lose not Christ!
   Whatever you miss, miss not salvation! May God impress you with this
   thought. May He impress you, moreover, with this thought--that, "today
   is the accepted time; today is the day of salvation"--and may some of
   you be unable to sleep tonight until you have found the Savior--

   "For should swift death this night overtake you, And your couch become
   your tomb," then tomorrow, if unregenerate and unforgiven, you would be
   shut up where hope can never come to you! Oh, seek His face tonight!
   Dare not permit yourselves to feel the image of death upon you in sleep
   unless you have felt the scepter of Christ, touched by faith,
   communicate life and pardon to you! Seek Him! Oh, seek Him! Seek Him
   while He may be found! Call upon Him while He is near! The Lord bless
   you, everyone of you, and may we meet in Heaven without exception, for
   Christ's sake! Amen and Amen!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: 2 TIMOTHY 1:1-18.

   Verse 1. Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according
   to thepromise oflife which is in Christ Jesus. Paul takes high ground.
   He is not an Apostle by the will of the Church, but an Apostle by the
   will of God! God's will is the great motive power in the Church of God.
   Some talk a great deal about man's will. What do you think of God's
   will, the will of the Almighty? Surely that shall stand! Paul felt that
   he had that at the back of him. "Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ by
   the will of God." Hence he always speaks very boldly. He never asks
   leave of anybody. If he is an Apostle by the will of God, he exercises
   his office without fear!

   2. To Timothy, my dearly beloved son Son in the faith. When all the
   ties of natural descent shall be forgotten, son-ship in Christ will
   continue. I do not doubt that in Heaven Timothy is still Paul's
   son--Paul is still father to Timothy, for the relation is of the
   Spirit.

   2. Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our
   Lord. I think I have called upon you to notice that when Paul writes to
   a Church, it is, "Grace and peace." Whenever he writes to a minister,
   it is, "Grace, mercy, and peace." I have sometimes wondered whether we
   ministers need mercy more than other people, and I suppose that we do,
   or else the Apostle would not have said, "Grace, mercy, and peace." Oh,
   if a minister gets to Heaven, it will be a wonder!

   His responsibilities are so great. "Who is sufficient for these
   things?" It will be a marvelous display of mercy if any of us shall be
   able to say at last, "I am clear of the blood of all men," for we have
   not only our own blood, but the blood of others to look to in this
   matter.

   3. I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience,
   that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and
   dayFor this Paul thanks God. He never forgot to pray for Timothy, and
   it is a matter of thankfulness. When we feel moved to pray, though it
   is for another, the spirit of prayer is essentially the same, whatever
   its object--and we ought to be thankful when we feel continually able
   to pray for a friend. "I thank God," he says, and he says that he had
   served God with a pure conscience all his days. So he had, but it was a
   blind conscience. At first, when he was a Pharisee, he still served
   God, though he then ignorantly persecuted the people of God! Oh, but it
   is a good thing sincerely to follow after God. May we be helped to do
   so. "I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day."

   4. Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may
   be filled with joy. What were those tears? Tears of holy men and women
   are as precious as diamonds! Paul had noticed the tears twinkling in
   brother Timothy's eyes--the tears of repentance, the tears of
   gratitude, the tears of fervent desire. He had noticed that and, being
   mindful of all this, he wished to see that dear face again!
   Christianity does not make us unsociable. It gives us new ties of love,
   fresh brothers, fresh sons.

   5. When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which
   dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice: and I am
   persuaded that in you, also. Happy son who has grandmother and mother
   before him in the faith! Unhappy young man who has quit the faith of
   his fathers and has turned aside altogether. If such are here, we would
   remember them in our prayers, but we cannot say that we can remember
   them with joy.

   6. Therefore I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God
   which is in you by the putting on of my hands.Stir up your gifts like a
   fire. It will not burn without sometimes poking. Stir it up! And every
   now and then it is a good thing to have the heart stirred up, awakened,
   quickened, brought to a higher diligence. We must try to do this.
   Perhaps there are some dear friends here who have a large measure of
   latent gifts, dormant faculties. Stir up the gift that is in you!

   7. For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of
   love, and of a sound mind. Neither Paul nor Timothy had a cowardly
   spirit. They were, neither of them, afraid. God had taught them His
   Truths and they knew them, and they held them, defying all opposition.

   8. Be not you, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of the Lord, nor of
   me, His prisoner. What? Were people ashamed of Paul? Oh, yes, dear
   Friends. The great Apostle, because he was persecuted, found himself
   despised by some of the very people who owed their souls to him! It is
   the lot of those who are faithful to Christ to find even good men
   sometimes turning against them. But what of that? They are responsible
   to their Master, not to their fellow servants! Yet it is a hard thing
   when any come to be ashamed of you--ashamed of you, though you know
   that you have done right. I do not wonder that he puts it even to
   Timothy, "Be not you, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
   nor of me, His prisoner." Some of us know what it is to have trained
   and brought up those about us, who were to us what Timothy was to
   Paul--who have been ashamed of us and of the testimony of our Lord.

   8. But be you partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to
   the power of God. You will need the power of God to do it, and mind you
   do it. Take your full share in whatever affliction the Gospel brings
   upon Christians. "According to the power of God."

   9. Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according
   to our works, but according to His own purpose and Grace, which was
   given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. How plain it is that
   he earnestly believed in the eternal Election of Believers--in their
   being in Christ and in their possession of Grace in Christ. "Grace
   which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began." God's love
   to His people is not a thing of yesterday! He loved them before the
   world was made and He will love them when the world has ceased to be.
   "It was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began."

   10-12. But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus
   Christ who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to
   light through the Gospel Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an
   Apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles. Indeed, for this cause I also
   suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for Iknow whom I
   have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I
   have committed unto Him against that day. Paul knew that Grace could
   keep his soul, but I think that he here means that he could keep his
   own Gospel. Paul had kept it, kept the faith, but he committed it now
   into the hands of the Greater One, who would keep it when every Apostle
   was

   dead, and every faithful witness had passed away. "He is able to keep
   that which I have committed unto Him against that day."

   13. Holdfast thee form of sound words. Many say they have no creeds,
   and there is hardly an Epistle in which there is not a distinct mention
   of a creed.

   13. Which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ
   Jesus. Hold fast the Truth of God. Hold fast the very form and shape of
   it! If you are to keep the life that is in an egg, you must not break
   the shell. Take care of it all, and take care of it all the more when,
   with specious reasoning they say, "We will hold the same Truth of God,
   only in a different form." Why a different form at all, if they do not
   wish to hold a different Doctrine altogether? No, my Brothers,
   especially you that are like young Timothy, take this passage to heart.
   "Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me in faith
   and love which is in Christ Jesus."

   14. That good thing which was committed unto you keep by the Holy
   Spirit which dwells in us. This is what we need! If the Holy Spirit is
   in us, we shall never trifle with the Truth. He is the lover and
   revealer of Truth, and we shall press the Doctrines of the Word of God
   and the Word of God, itself, nearer and nearer to our hearts in
   proportion as the Holy Spirit dwells in us!

   15. This you know, that all they who are in Asia have turned away from
   me; What? Turned away from Paul? Some people think it is an awful thing
   because certain people turn away from a minister of Christ. It is not
   an awful thing at all, except for them! Paul stands fast--even he, the
   bravest of the brave--and they all turn aside from him. What of that?
   Does Paul flinch? No, not he! "This you know, that all they who are in
   Asia have turned away from me."

   15. Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. Two men who ought to have
   known better! Paul evidently fixed his eyes upon them--more bitter than
   others, more perverse, more cruel, more willfully guilty in turning
   aside from him.

   16, 17. The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he
   often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chains. But when he was
   in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. You could not
   tell in Rome where a prisoner was. The registers were not open to
   investigation. You had to go from prison to prison, and pay the guards
   to get admission, or to be told who might be there, but Onesiphorus was
   determined to find Paul. I suppose that he went to the Mamertine, a
   dungeon in which some of us have been--one dungeon under the bottom of
   another. The first one has no light, except through a round hole at the
   top. And the second has a round hole through which you drop into the
   lower one. We think that Paul was there. It is a tradition that he was.
   And then there is the Palatine prison, which was at the guard house of
   the Praetorian guards, near the palace on the Palatine Hill. There Paul
   certainly was, and Onesiphorus went from one jail to another. "Have you
   seen a little Jew with weak eyes?" I daresay that was his description
   of him. "He is a friend of mine. I want to speak with him." "What? That
   Paul?--the man that is chained to one or another of us every morning?
   We have twelve hours of it and he preaches to us most of the time! And
   we know it by the time we are let go again!" "Oh, that is the man,"
   said Onesiphorus. "That is the man! Does he talk about Jesus Christ?"
   "Oh, nothing else but that. He will not let any soldier go from being
   bound to him without hearing about Jesus Christ." "That is my man,"
   said Onesiphorus. He sought him out very diligently, and he found him!

   18. The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy from the Lord in
   that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, you
   know very well.

Christ's Great Mission

   (No. 3532)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to
   give His Life a ransom for many." Matthew 20:28.

   THE mission of Christ to our world was distinct and definite. The
   ministry of the Gospel should be alike clear and transparent. It was
   but the other day I read a letter from the deacon of a church in which,
   speaking of his minister, he said, "We ought to understand geology
   thoroughly, for we usually hear something of it, at least once every
   Sunday. There is one thing, however, we shall never be likely to
   understand under our present friend's ministry-- he seems utterly to
   ignore the Doctrine of the Atonement. I have not heard him allude to it
   for the past three months, nor do I know, for certain, whether he
   believes it or not. Though he sometimes alludes to Jesus Christ as an
   example, I have neither heard of Christ dying, nor Christ buried, of
   Christ risen, or Christ pleading in Heaven at all! In fact, it seems to
   me I might as well attend a Socinian chapel." Well, God forbid that
   such a reflection should ever be cast on me! Is it not my constant
   endeavor to bring you back, Sabbath after Sabbath, to the same old, old
   story of the Cross and of the Redemption by blood which was then and
   there worked? This bell has but one note! It may be repeated, I
   sometimes fear, with too much monotony. Still, the tone is clear. I
   know that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. There is
   salvation in none other name under Heaven. The Propitiation which God
   has set forth for human sin is alone efficacious. There is no remission
   without blood. Full salvation is to be procured only through the wounds
   of Jesus slain. There is no salvation in Heaven or earth beside. We are
   coming to that same story again. It never wearies the Believer's ears,
   nor does it ever fail to be the Power of God unto salvation to everyone
   who believes! I want my text to speak this evening! Let me, then, begin
   by expounding it, word by word--and after that let me explain the
   Doctrine to which it gives most distinct prominence.

   I. THE PLAIN DECLARATION.

   "The Son of Man!" So does our Lord Jesus Christ speak of Himself. In
   relation to our fallen humanity, it sounds humble, but in the light of
   Prophecy, it is full of dignity. " The Son of Man." This is none other
   than the true Messiah-- the Son of God, Infinite, Eternal, Co-Equal
   with the Father--and yet He chooses to call Himself, full often, "the
   Son of Man." Perhaps because as it was man who committed sin, it is man
   who must make an Atonement for sin to the injured Law of God! Man was
   the offender, man must suffer the penalty. As in one man the whole
   family died, in another man they must be made alive, if made alive at
   all. Jesus tells us that He is a Man--thoroughly a Man--one like
   ourselves. The Son of Man, a Man among men, bone of our bone and flesh
   of our flesh--not wearing a fictitious manhood, but a real Humanity
   like our own! This we must always bear in mind, for without it there
   could be no Atonement at all. Jesus is not merely a Son of Man, but He
   is preeminently the Son of Man foretold in the prophecy of Daniel and
   predicted on the threshold of Paradise in the language of the first
   promise, "The Seed of the women shall bruise the serpent's head." He is
   the Man, the Second Adam in whom men are made alive. Being thus found
   in fashion as a Man and having taken upon Himself the Federal Headship
   of man, He was qualified to become man's Substitute and to make an
   Atonement for human guilt. Dwell on this blessed Truth of God, my dear
   Hearers! Dwell upon it, those of you who are not saved--look wistfully
   at it for the encouragement it offers you! The Person in whom you are
   admonished to trust is not only God--or His unclouded Glory might
   strike you with awe and His terrors might justly make you afraid--but
   He is also Man--and this ought to attract you to Him, for He is akin to
   yourselves in nature and sympathy. Sin excepted, He is in no wise
   different from you! Oh, may you not well draw near to Him without
   appalling dread, and with inspiring confidence, since He calls Himself
   the Son of Man and bids the sons of men come and put their trust under
   the shadow of His wings?

   He "came"--that is the next word in our text. "The Son of Man came."
   Strange the errand and unique as the blessed Person who undertook it.
   Thus to come He stooped from the highest Throne in Glory down to the
   manger of Bethle-

   hem--and on His part it was voluntary. We are, as it were, thrust upon
   the stage of action--it is not of our will that we have come to live on
   this earth. Jesus had no need to have been born of the virgin! It was
   His own consent, His choice, His strong desire that made Him take upon
   Himself our nature, of the seed of Abraham. He came voluntarily on an
   errand of mercy to the sons of men! Dwell upon this thought for a
   moment. Let it sink into your mind. He who was King of Kings and Lord
   of Lords, the Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace,
   voluntarily, cheerfully descended that He might dwell among the sons of
   men, share their sorrows, bear their sins and yield Himself up a
   Sacrifice for them, the innocent Victim of their intolerable guilt! If
   the angels burst out in song on that first Christmas night. If they
   made Heaven and earth ring with their sweet harmonies, much more may we
   who have a share in the redemptive work of the Incarnate God burst out
   into song as the news greets us that Heaven descends to earth, that God
   comes down to man, that the Infinite becomes an Infant, that the
   Eternal, who has life in Himself, deigns to dwell among the dying sons
   of men! Surely a way from earth to Heaven will now be opened up, since
   there is a way from Heaven to earth, so sacred, yet so simple! The same
   golden ladder that brings the blessed Visitant down to our humanity
   will also take us up to the Divinity of God, to see Him as our
   reconciled Father. "The Son of Man came."

   The next words are startling, for they reveal a singular intention, far
   different from the usual aim and end of messages and errands. "The Son
   of Man came not to be served, but to minister." Let me give you the
   exact translation, "Not to be served, but to serve." That is the
   nearest approach to a literal rendering I can supply. He came not to be
   served, but to serve! He had not a selfish thought in His Soul! Though
   He had set His heart upon being the Incarnate God, He had nothing
   whatever to gain by it. Gain? What could the Infinite God gain?
   Splendor? Behold the stars--far away they glitter beyond all mortal
   count! Servants? Does He need servants? Behold angels in their
   squadrons--twenty thousand, even thousands of angels are the chariots
   of the Almighty! Honor? No, the trumpet of fame forever proclaims Him
   King of Kings and Lord of Lords! Who can add to the splendor of that
   diadem that makes sun and moon grow pale by comparison? Who can add to
   the riches or the wealth of Him who has all things at His disposal? He
   comes, then, not to be served, but to serve! And you see Him in the
   workshop serving His reputed parent. You see Him in His home honoring
   His blessed mother with all filial obedience. You see Him at the
   noontide of His wonderful career in the midst of His disciples, much
   more their servant than their Master, though He always maintained
   precedence by His own Sovereign counsel, and by their weak
   apprehensions. As He takes the basin, and the pitcher, and the
   towel--and washes His disciples' feet--you can see the meekness of His
   disposition. And soon after this, you see Him giving Himself up--His
   body, His Soul, and His Spirit--in order that He might serve us! And
   what if I say that even at this very moment, as the Son of Man in
   Heaven, He continues a kind of service for His people? For Zion's sake
   He does not hold His peace and for Jerusalem's sake He does not rest,
   but still continues to intercede for those whose names He bears upon
   His heart! Hear it, then, all you people, and let everyone that hears
   hail the gracious fact--be you saints or sinners, be you saved already,
   or thirsty for the knowledge of salvation--the thought that Christ's
   errand was not to aggrandize Himself, but to benefit us, must be
   welcome! He does not come to be served, but to serve. Does not this
   suit you, poor Sinner--you who never did serve Him, you who could not,
   as you are, minister to Him? Well, He did not come to get your service!
   He came to give you His services, not that you might first do Him
   honor, but that He might show you mercy! Oh, you need Him so very much!
   And since He has come not to look for treasures, but to bestow
   unsearchable riches--not to find specimens of health, but instances of
   sickness upon which the healing art of His Grace may operate--surely
   there is hope for you! I think were I just now seeking Christ, and
   sorely cast down in spirit, it would make my heart beat for joy to
   think that Jesus came to serve, and not to be served. Perhaps I would
   say, He knows my case and He has come to serve me, poor me! Do I not
   need washing? Why should He not wash me? The dying thief rejoiced to
   see in his day the fountain which Jesus had opened! Why should not I
   see it, too, and have a washing from that precious One who came to
   serve the vilest and the meanest of the sons of men? Behold! Behold and
   wonder! Behold and love! Behold and trust! Jesus came from the right
   hand of God to the manger, to the Cross, to the sepulcher, not to be
   served, but that He might serve the sons of men!

   Pass on to the next words, "And to give His Life," or, more correctly,
   "and to give His Soul." We have no lives to give. Our lives are
   forfeited--they are due to Divine Justice. Christ had a Life of His own
   which was, by no means, due to God on account of any obligations. He
   had not sinned, but He gave His Life. The death of Christ was perfectly
   voluntary. As He was free to come, or not, so He was not under any
   constraint to give His Life, but He did so, and that of His own free
   will! The grand objective of His coming to this earth was to give His
   Life. Read the text again. "The Son of Man came not to be served, but
   to serve, and to give His Life." Our Lord Jesus Christ did not come
   into this world merely to be an Example, or merely to reveal the
   Godhead to the sons of men. He came to make a Substitutionary
   Sacrifice. He came to give His Soul as a ransom! If you do not believe
   this Doctrine, you do not believe Christianity. The very pith and

   marrow, the very sum and substance of the mission of Jesus Christ is
   His coming to give His Life that He might stand in the place of those
   for whom He died. He came on purpose to give His Life. Now to give the
   soul is something more than to give the life. He died, 'tis true, yet
   He did more than die--He died by an outpouring of all His Life-floods,
   by the endurance of an anguish such as no ordinary mortal could ever
   have borne. Of old 'twas the blood that made Atonement. The animal was
   presented in sacrifice, but the animal was no sacrifice till it was
   slain--and then when the purple stream smoked down the altar's side,
   and the bowels of it were cast upon the altar, then it was that the
   sacrifice was truly presented. Jesus Christ gave up the very essence of
   His Humanity to be a Substitutionary Sacrifice for us! His spirit was
   tortured with pangs that are past conception, much more past
   description! He said, "My Soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even unto
   death." He was like a splendid cluster put into the winepress, and the
   feet of eternal vengeance trod upon Him till the sacred wine of His
   atoning blood streamed forth to save the sons of men! He gave His very
   Self, His entire Self, His soul, His Life, His essential Being, to be a
   ransom for the sons of Adam! Oh, that I could turn your eyes to that
   great sight! Behold how He gave His Life! Would to God that for a
   moment your thoughts were fixed on those five streaming wounds, those
   sacred fountains of life, and health, of pardon and peace to dying
   souls! Oh, that your eyes could but gaze within the wounds, into that
   heart boiling like a cauldron with the wrath of God, tossed to and fro,
   heaving within itself, oppressed, burdened, tormented and filled with
   terrible anguish! Oh, that you could see it! Oh, that you could
   understand that He came from Heaven to suffer all this, to give Himself
   up thus, that He might be, instead of us, the Victim of a vengeance we
   deserved--that His griefs might avert our ruin, that His pangs might
   rescue us from destruction! He drank the cup of condemnation dry! Not a
   drop was left and, in so doing, He poured out His Soul unto death!

   Moreover, His death is our ransom. So it is written, He came to give
   His Life "a ransom." No one here, I suppose, needs to have explained to
   him what a ransom means. It may be fairly illustrated by the old Jewish
   ceremony of the redemption money. Every male person among the Jews
   belonged to God and he must be redeemed. There was a settled price. The
   rich were not to give more--the poor should not give less. The same
   amount was fixed for all. The tithe drachma was paid by every Jew. Then
   he was enrolled as one of the Lord's redeemed, of whom you so often
   read. Failing that, he would have been cut off from the congregation of
   Israel. That piece of money stood instead of the man--it was his
   ransom. He was not to die--he was to live as a redeemed person! That is
   just what Jesus has done for His people! He has put Himself, His Soul,
   His devoted Life, His accomplished death before God in the place of our
   soul, of our death, of us! And every man who has Christ to be his
   Substitute is a redeemed man! He is one of the Lord's ransomed people
   and shall go to Zion with songs of everlasting joy upon his head. But
   every man who has not accepted Christ remains an unredeemed man, under
   the curse and subject to the Divine Wrath--under the slavery of Satan
   and awaiting the sentence of an utter destruction! Jesus Christ came to
   give His Life as a ransom. As a slave is redeemed by the payment of a
   price, so Jesus redeems us from the curse of the Law under which we
   were by nature, having Himself come under the Law. He redeems us from
   the death which was due to us by Himself enduring a death which was a
   full equivalent in the estimation of God. He gave His Life as a ransom.

   Our text says "for many." We might with greater force and stricter
   accuracy translate it, "He gave His Life as a ransom in the place of
   many." The word, "for," there, has a substitutionary meaning, "He gave
   His Life instead of many." Indeed, this is the point of the
   sentence--One stood for many! Jesus suffered for many! He put Himself
   into the place of many! Mark the word, "many." With this we finish the
   exposition. It does not say "all." There are passages which speak of
   all. They have their meaning. None of them, however, refer to the
   substitutionary work of Christ. Jesus Christ did not give His Life as a
   ransom in the place of all mankind, but a ransom in the place of many
   men. Who are those many men? Bless God, they are many, for they are not
   a few! But who are they? God knows. "The Lord knows them who are His."
   You may ascertain as much as you need to know by answering a plain
   question. Do you trust Jesus Christ with your eternal destinies? Do you
   come, all guilty as you are, and rely upon His blood to take that guilt
   away? Do you confide in Jesus, and in Him, alone? If so, He died for
   you, and in your place--and you shall never die! This is your comfort,
   that you cannot die! How can you perish if Jesus was put into your
   place? If your debt was paid of old by Christ, can it ever be demanded
   of you again? Once paid, it is fully discharged--the receipt we have
   gladly accepted--and now we can cry, with the Apostle, "Who shall lay
   anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is
   he that condemns? It is Christ that died; yes, rather that has risen
   again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes
   intercession for us."

   See here the mainstay of every Believer's confidence! He knows that
   Christ died for him because he has put his trust in His blessed
   mediation. If Jesus died for me, then I cannot be condemned for the
   sins which He expiated. God cannot pu-

   nish twice for the one offense. He cannot demand two payments for one
   debt. The Believer, therefore, finds sweet solace in the song which
   Toplady composed--

   "Turn, then, my Soul unto your rest,

   The merits of your great High Priest

   Speak peace and liberty--

   Trust in His efficacious blood,

   Nor fear your banishment from God since

   Jesus died for thee."

   Thus did the Son of Man give His Life a ransom in the place of many.
   And such do I believe to be a fair and honest exposition of the words.

   II. SOME POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS.

   The main drift of the text is the Doctrine of a vicarious or
   substitutionary Atonement whereby Christ's ransom suffices in the place
   of many. On this let me give to each thought but a sentence or two. It
   would seem that man is not delivered from the bondage of his sins
   without a price. No one goes free by the naked mercy of God. Every
   captive exposed to God's vengeance must be redeemed before he is
   delivered, otherwise he must continue a captive. Broad as the statement
   may appear, I venture to assert by Divine Warrant that there never was
   beneath the cape of Heaven a sin forgiven without satisfaction being
   rendered. No sin against God is pardoned without a propitiation! It is
   only forgiven through the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ! It never
   can be remitted without the penalty having been exacted. The Divine Law
   knows of no exception or exemption. The statute is absolute, "The soul
   that sins, it shall die." Every soul that ever sinned, or ever shall
   sin, must die, die eternally, too, either in itself or in its
   Substitute. The justice of the Law of God must be vindicated. God
   waives none of the rights of justice in order to give liberty to mercy.
   Oh, my Hearers, if you are trusting in the unconditional mercy of God,
   you are trusting in a myth! Has someone buoyed you up with the thought
   of the infinite goodness of God? I would remind you of His infinite
   holiness! Has He not declared that He will by no means spare the
   guilty? No debt due to God is remitted unless it is paid. It must
   either be paid by the transgressor in the infinite miseries of Hell, or
   else it must be paid for him by a Substitute! There must be a price for
   the ransom and evidently, according to the text, thatpricemust be a
   soul, a life! Christ did not merely give His body, nor His stainless
   Character, nor merely His labors and sufferings, but He gave His Soul,
   His Life, as a ransom! Oh, Sinner, Almighty God will never be satisfied
   with anything less than your soul! Can you bear the piercing thought
   that your soul shall be cast from His Presence forever? Would you
   escape the dire penalty, you must find another soul to stand in your
   soul's place! Your life is forfeited. The sentence is passed. You shall
   die. Death is your doom! Die you must, forever die, unless you can find
   another life for a sacrifice in lieu of your life! And know that this
   is just what Christ has found. He has put a Soul, a Life, into the
   place of our souls, our lives. How memorable that text, "Without
   shedding of blood there is no remission." Why? Because "the blood is
   the life thereof." Until the blood flows, the soul is not divided from
   the body. The shedding of the blood indicated that the soul--the
   essence of the being--had been offered! Oh, blessed, forever blessed be
   the crowned head of Him who once did bear the Cross! He has offered for
   His people a Soul, a Life, a matchless Soul, a Life unparalleled! No
   more can Justice require! Vengeance is satisfied! The price is paid,
   the redeemed of the Lord are completely free!

   The question has been asked, "If we are redeemed by the blood of
   Christ, who receives the ransom?" Some have talked as if Christ paid a
   price to the devil! A more absurd imagination could never have crossed
   human mind! We never belonged to the devil. Satan has no rights in us.
   Christ never acknowledged that he had any and would never pay him
   anything! What then? Surely the ransom price was paid to the Great
   Judge of All. This is, of course, but a mystical way of speaking. A
   metaphor is employed to bring out the meaning. The fact is that God had
   sworn and would not repent, that sin must be punished! In the very
   essence of things, it was right that transgression should meet with its
   just recompense. There could be no moral government kept up, there
   could be no unimpeachable governor unless conviction followed crime and
   retribution was exacted from the guilty. It was not right, nor could it
   have been righteous, on any ground, for sin to have been passed over
   without its having been punished, or for iniquity to have escaped
   without any infliction! But when Jesus Christ comes and puts His own
   sufferings into the place of our sufferings, the Law is fully
   vindicated, while mercy is fitly displayed! A man dies--a Soul is
   given, a Life is offered--the Just for the unjust! What if I say that
   instead of Justice being less satisfied with the death of Christ than
   with the deaths of the ten thousand thousands of sinners for whom He
   died, it is more satisfied and it is most highly honored? Had all the
   sinners that ever lived in the world been consigned to Hell, they could
   not have discharged the claims of Justice! They must still continue to
   endure the scourge of crime they could never expiate. But the Son of
   God, blending the Infinite Majesty of His Deity with the perfect

   capacity to suffer as a Man, offered an Atonement of such inestimable
   value that He has absolutely paid the entire debt for His people! Well
   may Justice be content since it has received more from the Surety than
   it could have ever exacted from the sinner. Thus the debt was paid to
   the Eternal Father.

   Once more. What is the result of this. The result is that the man is
   redeemed. He is no longer a slave. Some preachers and professors affect
   to believe in a redemption which I must candidly confess I do not
   understand--it is so indistinct and indefinite--a redemption which does
   not redeem anybody in particular, though it is alleged to redeem
   everybody in general! A redemption insufficient to exempt thousands of
   unhappy souls from Hell after they have been redeemed by the blood of
   Jesus! A redemption, indeed, which does not actually save anybody,
   because it is dependent for its efficacy upon the will of the creature!
   A redemption that lacks intrinsic virtue and inherent power to redeem
   anybody, but is entirely dependent upon an extraneous contingency to
   render it effectual! With such fickle theories I have no fellowship!
   That every soul for whom Christ shed His blood as a Substitute, He will
   claim as His own and have as His right, I firmly hold! I love to hold
   and I delight to proclaim this precious Truth of God! Not all the
   powers of earth or Hell, not the obstinacy of the human will, nor the
   deep depravity of the human mind can ever prevent Christ seeing of the
   travail of His Soul and being satisfied! The last jot and tittle of His
   reward shall He receive at the Father's hand. A Redemption that does
   redeem! A Redemption that redeems many, seems to me infinitely better
   than a redemption that does not actually redeem anybody, but is
   supposed to have some imaginary influence upon all the sons of men!

   Our last question I must leave with you to answer. Did Jesus Christ
   redeem you? Ah, dear Hearer, this is a serious matter. Are you a
   redeemed soul or not? It is not possible for you to turn over the books
   of destiny and read between the folded leaves. Neither need you wish to
   do so. This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is to be preached to
   every creature under Heaven--"He who believes and is baptized shall be
   saved." Therefore, everyone that believes and is baptized, being saved,
   must have been redeemed, for He could not have been saved otherwise! If
   you believe and are baptized, you are redeemed, you are saved! Now for
   your answer to the question--Do you believe? "I believe," says one, and
   he begins to repeat what they call the "Apostle's Creed." Hold your
   tongue, Sir! That matters not--the devil believes that, perhaps more
   intelligently than you do--he believes and trembles! That kind of
   believing saves no man! You may believe the most orthodox creed in
   Christendom and perish! Do you trust--for that is the cream of the
   word, "believe"--do you trust in Jesus? Do you lean your whole weight
   on Him? Have you that faith which the Puritans used to call
   "recumbency," or, "leaning"? That is the faith that saves--faith that
   falls back into the arms of Jesus, a faith that drops from its own
   hanging place into those mighty arms and rests upon the tender breast
   of the Lord Jesus the Crucified! Oh, my Soul, make sure that you trust
   Him, for you have made sure of everything else when you have made sure
   of that! Has God the Holy Spirit taught you, my dear Hearer, that you
   cannot safely rely on your own good works? Has He weaned you from
   resting upon mere ceremonies? Has He brought you to look to the
   Cross--to the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, alone? If so, Christ
   redeemed you--you can never be a slave again! Has He redeemed you? The
   liberty of the Believer is yours, now, and after death the Glory of
   Christ shall be your portion, too! Remember the words of the dying monk
   when putting aside the "extreme unction" and all the paraphernalia of
   his apostate church--he lifted up his eyes and said, "Tua vulnara,
   Jesu! Tua vulnara Jesu!" "Your wounds, oh, Jesus! Your wounds, oh,
   Jesus!" This must be your refuge, poor broken-winged dove! Fly there
   into the clefts of the rock, into the spear-thrust in the Savior's
   heart! Fly there. Rest on Him! Rest on Him! Rest with all your weight
   of sin, with all your blackness and your foulness, with all your doubts
   and your despairs--rest on Him! Jesus wants to receive you! Fly to
   Him--fly away to Him now--

   "Come, guilty souls, and fly away,

   And look to Jesus' wounds--

   This is the accepted Gospel day,

   Wherein free Grace abounds.

   God loved His Church and gave His Son

   To drink the cup of wrath--

   And Jesus says He'll cast out none

   Who come to Him in faith."

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: MATTHEW20:1-28.

   Verses 1, 2. For the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is an
   landowner, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his
   vineyard. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day,
   he sent them into his vi-neyard.It was a fair wage. It was for fair and
   healthful work which they were to do in the vineyard. They were happy
   men to be hired so early in the morning. Never do those who serve
   Christ reject Him and though in this parable some are represented as
   finding fault with their wages, yet Christ's true servants do not so.
   Their only request is, "Dismiss me not from Your service, Lord." They
   feel it to be reward enough to be permitted to go on working. Indeed,
   this is one way in which we get our wages during the day. If we keep
   one precept, God gives us Grace to keep another! If we perform one
   duty, God gives us the privilege to perform another! So we are paid
   well. We work in the work. We say not "for the work," for we are
   unprofitable servants. Yet is there the penny a day.

   3. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle
   in the marketplace. It was bad for them to be standing there. No good
   is learned by idlers in idle company. Idle men together kindle a fire
   that burns like the flames of

   Hell.

   4, 5. And said unto them; Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever
   is right I will give you. And they went their way Again he went out
   about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. Much more out of
   charity than out of any good that he could get from them. Especially
   was this manifest when it got towards the latter end of the day. So
   late, so very late, it was but little they could do. Yet for their good
   he bade them come in.

   6. And about the eleventh hour Why, then, surely the day was over! They
   were ready to put away their tools and go home. But--

   6. He went out and found others standing idle, and said unto them, Why
   have you been standing here all day idle? "Why? Can you give a reason
   for it? Why stand here in the marketplace, where men come together on
   purpose to be hired? Why do you stand here, you able-bodied ones that
   still might work? Why do you stand here all day? That you should be
   idle a little while is bad enough. Why do you stand here all day, and
   why do you stand here all the day idle, when there is so much work to
   be done, and such a wage to receive for it?"

   7. They said unto him, Because no man has hired us. He said unto them,
   Go you also into the Vineyard and whatever is right, that shall you
   receive.And so the great landowner was glad when he had emptied the
   marketplace of the idlers, and brought in from early morning, even till
   sunset, so many that should be at work--happily at work there. I wonder
   whether there are any here early in the morning of life who have not
   yet come into the vineyard? If so, the Master calls you! Are you in
   middle life? Have you reached the sixth hour, and are you not enlisted
   in His service? Again the Master calls you! And if you have reached the
   eleventh hour, where are you? Decrepit--leaning on your staff--leaning
   downward to your grave? Yet if you are not called now, now He calls you
   and bids you, even at this late hour, come into the vineyard!

   8. 9. So when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard said unto his
   steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire, beginning from
   the last unto the first And when they came that were hired about the
   eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.And when souls come to
   Christ, however late it is, they have the same joy, the same matchless,
   perfect peace, the same salvation, even, as those who have come while
   yet they are young! True, they have lost many days, many hours of happy
   service. They have permitted the sun to decline and have wasted much
   time, but yet the Master gives them the same life within them, the same
   adoption into the family of God, the same blessing!

   10. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
   received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.Why, there
   are some of us who have now been in Christ's vineyard ever since we
   were boys, but we must not think that we shall receive, or can have,
   more than those who have just come in! I have heard people say, "Why,
   here are these people just lately converted, and they are singing and
   rejoicing! And there are some of the old people that have been
   following the Lord for years--and they do not seem to have half the
   joy! No, no. That is true. It is the old story of the elder brother and
   the prodigal over again. But do not--do not let us repeat that forever
   and ever! Do not let us get off of the lines of free, rich, Sovereign
   Grace, and begin to think that there is some desert in us, some merit
   in us. Oh, my Brothers and Sisters, I will be glad enough to sit at the
   feet of the meanest child of God, if I am but to be numbered in the
   family--glad enough to have the same salvation which the dying thief
   obtained, though only at the last moment he looked to Christ! Yet there
   is this spirit that will grow up--that some who have been longer in the
   work ought certainly to have more joy, more of everything, than those
   that have just come in. See the answer to it.

   11-16. And when they had received it, they murmured against the good
   man of the house, saying, These last have worked but one hour and you
   have made them equal to us, which have borne the burden and heat of the
   day. But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I do you no wrong.
   Did not you agree with me for a penny? Take that which is yours

   andgo your way: I will give unto this last, even as unto you. Is it not
   lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is your eye evil because I
   am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many are
   called, but few chosen. The great principle of Election in Divine
   Sovereignty will crop up, not in one place, but in many! God will have
   us know that He is Master, and that in the Kingdom of Grace He will
   have mercy on whom He will have mercy, and in the distribution of that
   Grace He will give according to His own good pleasure! And the moment
   we begin to murmur or set up claims, He answers us at once with, "Is it
   not lawful for Me to do what I will with My own?" Yet that
   unevangelical spirit, that un-gospel spirit of fancying that we have
   some sort of claim or right will come in--and it must be sternly
   repressed. It is of Grace --of Grace alone--of Grace to begin with, of
   Grace to go on with, of Grace to close with! And human merit must not
   be allowed to put a single finger anywhere! "Where is boasting, then?"
   says the Apostle. "It is excluded." It is shut out--the door shut in
   its face. It must not come in. If you and I serve God throughout a long
   life, we shall certainly have much greater happiness in life than those
   can have who come to Christ only at the last. But, as far as the Gospel
   blessing is concerned, which Christ gives, it is the same salvation
   which the newly-born Christian enjoys as that which the most advanced
   Believer is now enjoying! It is to every man the penny bearing the
   King's own impression!

   17-20. And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples
   aside on the way, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem,
   and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto
   the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death. And shall deliver Him
   to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him: and the
   third day He shallrise again. Then came to Him the mother ofZebedee's
   children with her sons, worshipping Him, and desiring a certain thing
   of Him.Then, in the most inopportune time in all the world, when Jesus
   was talking of being mocked and crucified, and put to death, here comes
   Mistress Zebedee with an ambitious request about her sons!

   21. AndHe said unto her, What do you wish?She said unto Him, Grant that
   these, my two sons, may sit, the one on Your right hand, and the other
   on the left, in Your Kingdom. He is thinking of a Cross, and they are
   dreaming of a crown! He is speaking of being mocked and put to death,
   and they have ideas of royalty, that they want to have the chief place
   in the coming Kingdom! Oh, how like ourselves! Our Master thinks of how
   He can condescend, and we are thinking of how people ought to respect
   us, and treat us better than they do! Oh, the selfishness that there is
   in us! May our Master's example help to stay it.

   22-24. But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you
   able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with
   the baptism that I am baptized with? They said unto Him, We are able.
   And He said unto them, You shall, indeed, drink of My cup, and be
   baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit at My
   right hand, and at My left is not Mine to give. But it shall be given
   to them for whom it is prepared by My Father And when the ten heard it,
   they were moved with indignation against the two brothers.Thus showing
   that they were exactly like they, "For," they said, "look at these
   two--this James and John--they want to have the preference over us! We
   will not have it." It was exactly the same spirit in each one--ambition
   in them all for priority of honor. Ah, dear Friends, it often happens
   that when we are so intent in our condemnation of others, it is only
   because we fall into the same sin! Some, I have no doubt, whatever,
   hate the Pope because they have the essence of popery in themselves.
   Two of a trade will never agree--and one man is very angry with another
   because he is so angry--and one is quite indignant that another should
   be so proud. Heis not proud. He is proud to say he is humble--he is,
   therein, proving how proud he is! Oh, that those beams in our eyes
   could be taken out. Then the specks in our brothers' eyes would
   probably no more be seen.

   25-28. But Jesus called them unto Him, and said, You know that the
   princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they who are
   great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you:
   but whoever will be great amongyou, let him be your servant And whoever
   will be first amongyou, let him be your slave. Even as the Son ofMan
   came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His Life a ransom for
   many.

Recruits for the King

   (No. 3533)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "David, therefore, departed from there, and escaped to the Cave
   Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it,
   they went down there to him. And everyone that was in distress, and
   everyone that was in debt, and everyone that was discontented, gathered
   themselves unto him, and he became captain over them: and there were
   with him about four hundred men." 1 Samuel 22:1-2.

   DAVID in the caverns of Adullam is a type of our Lord Jesus Christ
   despised and rejected among the sons of men. Christ is the Lord's
   Anointed, but men perceive not the anointing. He is persecuted by His
   great enemy, the world, as David was persecuted by Saul, and he now
   rather dwells in the Cave of Adullam than sits upon his throne. Just as
   when David was in his dishonor, it was the time for his true friends to
   rally around him. And so at this hour, when the name of Christ is
   associated with much of dishonor and rebuke, now is the time for the
   true followers of the Savior to rally around His banner and to espouse
   His cause. To come to David after he had been crowned king was poor
   work--the sons of Belial could do that--but to ally themselves to David
   when he was obliged to hide himself in mountain caves from his cruel
   enemies, this proved men to be David's true friends and loyal subjects.
   Blessed are they to whom it shall be given to enlist under the banner
   of Christ at this present time, who shall not be ashamed to confess Him
   before the sons of men, or to boldly take up His Cross and to suffer
   such loss and persecution as it may please His Providence to ordain for
   them to bear. As it is not concerning David, but concerning David's
   greater Son, I propose to address you this evening, let me say a few
   words at the outset to--

   I. THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY ENLISTED IN HIS BLESSED BAND.

   Foremost among those of David's troop were his brothers and all his
   father's house. So, too, Beloved in Christ, we who have been called by
   Divine Grace are regarded by Him as His brethren and all His Father's
   house. Looking round upon His disciples when He was here below, our
   blessed Master said, "Behold My mother and My brethren! For whoever
   shall do the will of God, the same is My brother, and My sister, and
   mother." Such His condescension that He is not ashamed to call us
   brethren. As many of us as have given our hearts to Him, rely upon Him
   and love Him, are really and truly His brethren and of His Father's
   house. His Father is our Father, His joy is our joy, and His Heaven
   shall be our Heaven before long! Now, what shall I say to you, my
   Brothers and Sisters in Jesus Christ, but this--Let us take care that
   we boldly avow our kinship with David, our Lord! Let us never blush to
   defend the cause of Christ. There are different ways of playing the
   coward--let us seek to avoid them all. The minister who is bold enough
   when he preaches before the multitude may feel his lips quiver when he
   has to speak face to face with one individual. O God, save Your
   servants from this form of cowardice! Or some of you may be able to
   speak to one or two persons, but if, perchance, you are thrown into a
   little promiscuous company, where you ought to avow your allegiance to
   your Lord, you hold your tongue and lose the opportunity for lack of
   courage. God deliver His servants from this form of cowardice, also! In
   all companies, on all occasions and under all circumstances, be
   faithful to your Master--deny Him not, but openly avow Him before the
   sons of men! How He deserves to be acknowledged by us since He has
   taken knowledge of us and recognized us when we were infinitely beneath
   His notice! Oh, ten thousand blushes should cover our faces, to think
   that we could ever at any time think it hard to acknowledge that He is
   our Lord and Master! Pray for courage, my Brothers and Sisters--I am
   sure it is needed! It seems to come to Christians naturally in
   persecuting times, but in these soft, silken days of piping peace you
   mingle in society, so called, with such deference to fashion, and you
   go in and out of your drawing rooms with such dainty conceits, you
   converse so complacently with your friends, you are such well-bred
   ladies and gentlemen in

   your own estimation, that you often forget that you are Christians--in
   honor bound to keep the faith and bear the testimony to Christ! It is,
   perhaps, easier for the poor to be bold in confessing the Redeemer's
   name than it is for those in more affluent circumstances. Alas, alas,
   if good fortune imperils your faithfulness! This is wicked, indeed! It
   is a sorry rebuke to utter from a Christian pulpit! It ought to be the
   very reverse. Your pecuniary independence ought not to enslave you. God
   deliver you who love Christ from anything like shamefacedness in
   connection with the Kingdom of your exalted Head!

   Let me urge you, also, as you boldly confess Him, to leave the world in
   order to join Him. His brethren and His father's house, we are told,
   concerning David, left Saul's territory and went away to Adullam to be
   with the hunted ones. Let us do the same! Ah, there is too much worldly
   conformity about everyone among us! I will not attempt to point any
   finger at any of my Brothers and Sisters, or expose their faults, but a
   man must be blind not to perceive that many Christians do their utmost
   to be as worldly as they can be consistently with their idea of getting
   to Heaven at last. Are there not many who in their dress, in the
   fitting up of their houses, in the conduct of their business, conform
   so closely to the times and the fashions, that if they were not known
   to be Christians by some other evidences, they would not be classed by
   any observers with those who are on the Lord's side? I do not think it
   possible for us to be too thoroughly nonconformist in respect to the
   maxims, the usages and vanities of this present evil world! What does
   this text mean? "Come you out from among them." Is not that enough? No!
   "Be you separate." Is not that enough? No! "Touch not the unclean
   thing." So thorough is to be the separation that there must be a coming
   out, a snapping of every link that maintains a connection with evil and
   the renewal of that communion by even so much as a touch is to be
   avoided by us! Take David's part, you that love David. Renounce
   everything for David! Oh, you Christian men and women, if you love
   Jesus, you must know He is worth ten thousand worlds! He is to be
   esteemed before all the pomp and gaiety of this poor world, were its
   charms and allurements multiplied a million times! He is infinitely to
   be preferred rather than to court the smiles of the great, or to enjoy
   the love of your friends, or to be flattered by the good opinions of
   your relatives! Therefore, I pray you, leave all to follow Him and
   forsake all other to cleave to Him, and Him alone!

   But am I not speaking to many who have confessed Him, who are
   confessing Him, and who do, more or less every day of their lives,
   practice a self-denying nonconformity to the world? Oh, Brothers and
   Sisters, I long that our sense of duty should kindle to an ardent
   enthusiasm! Can we not do something heroic, or dare something perilous,
   in token of our loyalty to Christ? Oftentimes my heart grows big with a
   strong desire that I might see a Church in this place, pre-eminent for
   consecration to the Captain of our Salvation! I prayed for this just
   now--nor was it for the first time I offered that prayer. If we did but
   give of our ample property, or of our scanty pittance, at the rate
   which all of us should give--or if we did but work for Christ at the
   rate which He deserves of us, or anything at all like it--if we did but
   live for Jesus in any measure as gratitude might prompt, what a front
   we would present--what a power we would exert!

   As a great Church, how we might tell upon this great city! What a mark
   we might leave upon our age! But why am I talking about the whole
   community? I have not yet attained unto this pure devotion myself!
   Still, God knows I am wishing to press onward. I aim to forget that
   which is behind, while reaching forward and pressing onward. Beloved,
   you remember the story of those three strong men who, when David sighed
   for a drink from the well of Bethlehem, risked their lives to procure
   it for him? Are there no strong men here--men of faith, men of
   valor--who will dare exploits for my Master? He cries out for the
   conversion of souls--will none of you consecrate yourselves to that
   work? Will none of you break through the conventionalities of society
   in quest of seekers? He says, "Give Me a drink," just as He said to the
   woman at Samaria's well--and His thirst is satisfied when He sees His
   Father's will accomplished! Are there not men here strong, brave, and
   chivalrous, who can preach Christ where He has never been preached
   before? There were others among David's followers who did exploits like
   these--one of them slew a lion in a pit, in winter time, while of
   another we are told that he slew the Philistines, and the Lord worked a
   great victory! And can we not do something that shall exceed and excel
   the ordinary service of modern Christianity? I blush for modern
   Christianity! Its gold has become dim. Its most fine gold is changed.
   Its glory has departed. The early Christians were full of an enthusiasm
   which could not have tolerated the languid indifference of these times!
   They were so devoted, so intense, so passionate, so full of Divine
   furor for the extension of the Redeemer's Kingdom that they made their
   influence felt wherever they dwelt, or even sojourned for a short
   season! God send us some of this sacred zeal now! We need more of the
   enthusiasm which burned in the hearts of Wesley and of Whitfield! Where
   shall we look for the glowing ardor and the untiring labors of the
   Apostle

   Paul? Where are the disciples that emulate the zeal of the blessed
   Master, whose meat and whose drink it was to do the will of Him who
   sent him? May this be given to us all! God send it to us--send it to
   us, now, send it to us here, send it to me, send it to you, my Brothers
   and Sisters--and send it to you henceforth throughout your lives!

   I do not think I need say more, unless it is to entreat you to keep up
   your courage when you know that you are engaged in the cause of Christ.
   There is a great struggle going on around us. This entire nation is
   from time to time convulsed with serious questions in which the honor
   of our Lord Jesus Christ is greatly concerned. Let all those who love
   Him stand forth with unflinching integrity! Expediency is the mean word
   that describes the lax morals of the age, but righteousness'is the
   undeviating, the eternal principle by which the universe is governed!
   The Kingdom of Christ is not of this world. Be it ours to help the
   oppressed, to succor the weak and to give liberty of conscience to all
   men. May God defend the right! Defend the right He will! If our names
   are cast out as evil. If we are misunderstood and misinterpreted,
   belied and slandered, let it be so--we are neither surprised nor
   dismayed! The right has always to be maintained in the teeth of slander
   and abuse. But, in God's name, let us not be cowards! Let us always do
   our duty manfully and lawfully. Let us cheerfully hold fast our
   profession. Let us adhere with confidence and steadfastness to the
   Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. The Star of David is in the
   ascendant--the house of Saul is growing weaker and weaker. Having thus
   addressed the soldiers, I am now coming for a few minutes to--

   II. ACT AS A RECRUITING SERGEANT.

   Besides his own relatives, there were others who joined with David.
   Now, why did they join him? For much the same reason, I may answer,
   that has influenced many of us. It was because they had need of him.
   They ought to have gone to David because his character was so good and
   his conduct so upright. They ought to have helped him because his
   disposition was so kind and sympathizing. They might well have rallied
   to his standard because he was the Lord's Anointed. They might, as wise
   men, have cast in their lot with him because there was prophecy and
   promise of his triumph and his reign over the nation. But they were
   really swayed by other motives. They went to him for three
   reasons--because they were distressed, because they were in debt and
   because they were discontented. Through dire dismay they sought shelter
   and succor.

   Now perhaps it were well should I tell you of the sweet Character of
   the Lord Jesus, but if I did, you would not come to Him. It were well
   did I tell you of the prowess of my Master, and how He conquered
   Goliath and slew the foemen who tyrannized over us. It might be well
   were I to tell you that He is God's appointed Savior, that He is
   destined to reign as King, and that they who confess Him, now, shall be
   exalted with Him when He comes in His Kingdom. Attractive as all this
   might be to some minds, the master attraction always is that He becomes
   suitable to you in your present necessities--in those dilemmas which
   just now press heavily on your souls. So I propose to address the three
   sorts of people who are most likely to come to Jesus, hoping that they
   will seize this propitious hour and enlist under His banner at once,
   without hesitation or delay!

   The first sort who came to David were distressed. They were "hard up,"
   as we say. They had spent their substance. They were bankrupts--their
   means and their hopes alike exhausted--therefore they went to David.
   They seemed to say, "Our case is so bad that it cannot be worse--it may
   be better if we go to David." Their case was like yours, so well
   described in our hymn--

   "I can but perish if I go, I am resolved to try-- For if I stay away, I
   know I must forever die."

   I know there are some distressed ones here! I have come to enlist them
   in my Master's ragged regiment! 'Tis thus despair will vanish and thus
   will hope revive, for being enlisted under Him, their courage may rally
   while they fight His battles and receive His blessing!

   You are distressed because you feel you have no merit of your own. That
   feeling is very right, for you have none! You never had and you never
   will have any! At one time you thought you were as good as other
   people, or perhaps you even thought you were better. That vain thought
   has now gone. Your good works, your merits, your best endeavors, your
   choicest prayers all dissolve--nor dare you glory in any one of them!
   Come, then, to Christ! He has merits for those who have none. His cause
   is good, though yours is bad. You are the very sort of people whom He
   came to rescue, for whom He died! He came, not to call the righteous,
   but sinners to repentance! Inasmuch as you are evidently sinners, come!
   Come to

   the sinner's Savior! Put your trust in Him and live! Others are
   distressed because they feel they have not any power. You cannot
   believe, you say. You cannot repent. In fact, you cannot do anything as
   you would! The more you try, the more powerless you find yourselves to
   be. You would pray, but you cannot! You feel so dead, so cold. If you
   attempt to move, it seems all to end in disappointment. Well, my dear
   Hearers, Jesus Christ died for them who have no strength, for thus is
   it written, "In due time, when we were yet without strength, Christ
   died for the ungodly." Oh, you that have no power, take heart, because
   Christ is the Power of God! There is ability enough in Him to make up
   for all your impotency! Come and cast yourselves with all your weakness
   upon His irresistible might, and you shall have a full supply of all
   that your souls need!

   But I know there are some here who are distressed, because, in addition
   to their having no merit and no power, they have no sensibility. "I do
   not feel my need as I ought," says one. "I have not such a sense of my
   sin and danger as I would like," says another. Oh, Beloved, Jesus
   Christ came to raise the dead! He came to give sensibility to those who
   are callous and careless, to turn hearts of stone into flesh! I believe
   those persons who think they do not feel their need are those who do
   really feel their need the most. There is no sense of need so great as
   when a man feels that he does not feel and thinks that he does not
   apprehend the depth of his own need, for then he is evidently alive to
   his true condition! You may possibly have more of the work of the Holy
   Spirit in you than some others whose sense of need appears more lively,
   though it proves less lasting. That deep, awful solicitude which makes
   you fear because you do not feel, and makes you groan because you
   cannot grieve, is not to be despised, for it is an experience often
   associated with gracious operations of the Spirit of God! Whether it is
   so or not in your case, give no place to despondency, but believe that
   Christ can save you, for He is able and willing to do so! If you cannot
   come with a broken heart, come fra broken heart. If you cannot come to
   Him repenting, come to Him to get repentance, for He is exalted on high
   to give repentance as well as remission of sins. He does not require
   any preparation in you. All the preparation He requires, He prepares
   Himself, and that is the work of His Spirit in your souls! Come, then,
   you who are distressed and distrustful, you who have not any good thing
   to recommend you as creatures, nor any good desire to extenuate you as
   sinners--you who are so consciously bad that there could not be found a
   good apology for you, even in your own estimation, if you were racked
   over and over again! Come to Jesus, lost, ruined, undone,
   poverty-stricken, as you are! Come and trust my Master, the Son of
   David! The way to be enlisted, you know, into Her Majesty's service, is
   to take the shilling. The way to enlist in Christ's service is simply
   to trust Him! You need not bring anything nor take anything, but simply
   trust in Him and you shall become a soldier of the Cross!

   The next persons mentioned in the text in coming to David were those
   who were in debt. I would gladly ask those in debt to come to Jesus.
   The man thus in debt says, "I have got to pay my life. I have sinned
   and God has said that the sinner shall die. Yet I cannot afford to
   forfeit my life. How can I dare to die? I have no hope, no trust, no
   confidence with which to pass the iron gates of death! And then, after
   death, there is the terror ofjudgment for my soul since I have broken
   God's Law--and the Law condemns me and demands my banishment from His
   Presence, and my final destruction. What shall I do? I cannot pay the
   debt, the thought of being put into prison forever is terrible to me.
   How, how! Oh, tell me, how can I escape?" Ah, well, I should be glad,
   indeed, if there were some here who should thus admit their debts and
   their inability to pay them. Happy preacher to have to address such an
   awakened audience! Happy hearers to be dismayed with such hopeful
   anxieties! Blessed, indeed, were our work if we always had those before
   us who knew the debt of sin, who felt its grievous demerit and feared
   its glaring doom! Take counsel, then--whatever debt you owe, whether it
   is great or small--come and trust in Jesus and you shall be relieved of
   the responsibility! Come and rely on Him who suffered in the sinner's
   place and was punished for the ungodly--bearing their iniquities in His
   own body on the Cross! A look at Him, one look of faith, will disclose
   to you the transfer of every debt and every sin from you to Him! You
   shall see how He casts them into the Red Sea of His atoning blood,
   where, though they may be sought for, they shall never more be found. I
   would gladly enlist you, poor debtor, and take you out of the Debtor's
   Prison, and introduce you to my Master's table! Bankrupt debtors make
   good soldiers for the King! Come, then, without more ado, and be
   enlisted in the King's army!

   Another class that came to David was those who were discontented. Such
   there are, nor have we far to go to seek them out. Yonder is one, to
   whom I would now speak. But a little while ago you were a happy young
   fellow. You could go into all kinds of revelry and little reckon the
   sin, so fully did you enjoy them all! You cannot do so now. You do not

   understand the reason why, but the keen edge of your appetite seems to
   have been blunted--your taste for dissipation is gone. Those companions
   who were once such rare jolly fellows have ceased to cheer you with
   their talk. You do not enjoy their gabble now, it seems so flat, and
   stale, and foolish! You cannot laugh at their lewd jests, or quaff
   their sparkling cup as once you used to do. You have been behind the
   scenes of this poor world and you have pitied the pale cheeks that are
   painted with the hue of blooming youth--you have heard the heavy sighs
   of those that raise the merry laugh--and you have witnessed so much
   wanton disguise that it has filled you with woeful disgust! You have
   seen enough to know how it will all end. No marvel that you are
   discontented! You are the man for me! Yours is the ear I want to catch!
   Yours the heart I love to reach! A blessed case it is when a man gets
   discontented with this vain world, for then, perhaps, he may seek after
   another world, a brighter, better sphere! When he is out at elbows with
   himself and all his foolish companions, then, perhaps, he will make
   acquaintance with the exiled, but anointed Man of Bethlehem, and find
   in Him a Friend, a Counselor who will be his Helper, speaking kindly,
   advising wisely and leading on triumphantly till He calls you to
   participate in the Kingdom of His Glory! You are discontented with
   yourselves. Your own reflections bitterly reprove you. When you sit
   down and think a little--a habit into which, perhaps, you have but
   lately fallen--you discover that things are out of the square. You
   cannot feel satisfied. Strange strivings and manifold misgivings
   perplex you and you get no peace. For my part, I am thankful, a
   thousand times thankful, that you have come to be so ill at ease when
   there was so much cause for disquiet! Now there is some hope that you
   will trust your future and your fate to the Son of David! Close in with
   the offers of His Grace and be saved by Him!

   I recollect an old sailor who, after having been for nearly 60 years a
   drunkard and a swearer, and everything that was bad, heard a Gospel
   sermon that touched his heart. And when he came forward to make a
   profession of his faith in Christ, he said, "I have been sailing 60
   years under a very bad owner, and under a very bad flag, but now I have
   taken on board a new cargo and am running for a very different port,
   and under quite a different flag." So I trust it will be with some of
   you, soon, that you will change your cargo, change your flag and change
   everything! After preaching in the Wes-leyan chapel at Boulogne one day
   some time ago, a person recognized me and was telling me how he had
   found Christ through reading the sermons. About that time an old salt
   came up to me and said, "Do you know me? My name was Satan once, I
   remember you well. Now Satan came here one Sunday morning and he richly
   deserved his name, for he was as much like Satan as a man could be! He
   sat there, and after the sermon the Lord touched old Satan, and gave
   him another name besides." The man came to Christ because he was
   discontented with himself, and so he gave himself up to Jesus, and was
   saved by Him. Is there any old salt here who will do that now? May
   there not be some sailor, some soldier, some stranger somewhere here,
   who shall say this night, "I will approach the King and ask Him to
   accept me, even me"? If He does not accept you, please let us know, for
   we have never yet met with a case in which Jesus refused a poor sinner
   that came to Him! He has said, "He that comes unto Me I will in no wise
   cast out." Should He cast you out, it will be a new thing under Heaven!
   But He cannot do it! If you are black as sin can stain you, yet if you
   come to Him, you shall be taken into the Savior's bosom, washed in the
   fountain filled with His blood, started on a new career and helped to
   serve Him all your days! But I must come to a finish. I have addressed
   myself to the Lord's people. I have beaten up for recruits for King
   Jesus, and now I want to--

   III. TELL THE RECRUITS A LITTLE ABOUT THE SERVICE, and then I have
   done. Remember the last words of the text, "And David became a captain
   over them." Whoever, then, comes to Christ must submit to Christ's
   rules. What are they? One of the first is that you should be nothing at
   all and that King Jesus should be everything. Will you submit to
   that--that you shall have no honor, that you shall take to yourselves
   no credit, that you shall never lean on your own strength or
   wisdom--but you shall take Him to be made of God unto you wisdom, and
   righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption? I hope you will not
   kick at that.

   Another of our Lord's rules in His kingdom is that, if you love Him,
   you must keep His commandments. After trusting Him, you are to become
   obedient unto Him. One commandment is that you are to be baptized. Do
   not stumble at that! I think if there is anything plain in Scripture--I
   will only speak for myself, I cannot speak for anybody else--it is that
   every Believer is to be immersed in water as a confession of his faith.
   I think I could as soon doubt that the Deity of Christ is declared as
   doubt that the Baptism of Believers is enjoined, for the one thing
   appears to me to be as plainly revealed in Scripture as the other! I
   pray you, Brother, Sister, be not disobedient to the Lord's commands,
   but remember the Gospel which we preach, "He that believes and is
   baptized shall be saved." Keep to the two points and claim the

   promise! Then there is the Lord's Table, of which, if you join
   yourselves to Christ, you have a right to partake. Do not forget it. It
   will sweetly remind you of all that your Savior has done and suffered
   for you. It is nothing more than a remembrancer, but take care that you
   do not neglect so blessed a memorial! All the precepts and statutes of
   our Lord Jesus Christ are to be cordially obeyed. Albeit, Christ opens
   a hospital for all sick folk--He does not mean you to be always
   cripple, but His purpose is to heal you--and after that to teach you
   how to walk. He builds up His kingdom as Romulus built up Rome. He
   receives all the vagrants of the neighborhood, but then He makes new
   men of them! Even so those that are gathered from the outcasts are to
   be made faithful in Christ Jesus. Drunkard, you must have done with
   your cups! Swearer, you must have your mouth washed out--no more of
   those foul oaths must you utter! You who have given yourselves up to
   carnal pleasures must be purged from all your defilements! You who have
   been gay and frivolous must renounce those vanities and seek after
   weighty, solemn, eternal interests. You who have had hard hearts,
   before, you must ask the Master to make them soft--and whatever He says
   to you, you must do.

   Now, my young recruit, what do you say to this? You who would bear the
   name of Christ and get to Heaven, are you willing to come to Him and
   give yourselves up to Him, henceforth forsaking all your sins? He that
   gives not up his sins makes a great mistake if he thinks to escape the
   wrath of God, or hopes to find Grace in His eyes! Oh, will you not give
   up your sins? They are vipers! They will only poison your souls! They
   will destroy you! Oh, give them up! Give them up, for what shall it
   profit you to keep them, and to lose your soul? Come to Jesus first.
   Trust His merit. Rely upon His precious blood and then, by His help,
   renounce every evil way and seek to obey Him who has redeemed you by
   His blood! So shall the blessing of the Lord rest upon you forever!
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM68.

   "A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah."

   Exiled, ill at ease, hunted, exposed to danger. Yet he could sing. And
   some of the sweetest Psalms come out of the bitterest afflictions.
   God's songsters are like nightingales that reserve their sweetest music
   for the night. Whenever you and I come to be in the wilderness, may we
   refresh ourselves with such a Psalm as this!

   Verse 1. O God, You are my God. Everything else has gone, but You are
   my God! There are gods of the heathen, but You, the true and real
   Jehovah, are my God! Oh, what a blessed thing it is to take a firm grip
   of God after this fashion, "O God, You are my God,"

   2. Early will I seek You. "Oh," says one, "why did he seek God if God
   was his?" Would you have him seek another man's God, then? No. It is
   because He is ours that we seek Him and desire His company. If you know
   God to be your God, you will not be satisfied unless you are living
   near Him. "Early will I seek You." I will not wait. I cannot wait. I
   cannot tarry. I must not tarry. Early will I seek You.

   2. My soul thirsts for You, my flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty
   land, where there is no water. Thirst is one of the strongest longings
   of our nature. Hunger you can appease for a while, but thirst is awful.
   There is no staying that. When it is once upon a man, he must have
   water, or die. "My soul thirsts for You. My flesh longs for You in a
   dry and thirsty land where there is no water." No means of Grace.
   Nothing to help me. No Believers round about me--left alone, thirsting
   for my God. And yet it is so precious a thing, so sure a mark of Grace
   to thirst for God anywhere, that one may be thankful even to be in a
   dry and thirsty land if one possesses a true thirst after God!

   2. To see Your power and Your glory, so as Ihave seen You in the
   sanctuary. He had seen God in His Holy Place, and he longs to see Him
   again. They who never knew God do not want to know Him. But they who
   have known Him desire to know Him more and more! If you do not long for
   the Bread of Heaven, it is because you never tasted it. He who has once
   tasted it will sigh and hunger till he is satisfied with it!

   3. Because Your loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall
   praise You. "Better than life," and surely life is better than anything
   else! "Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has will he give for his
   life." Life is better than food. Life is better than riches. And if the
   loving kindness of God is better than life, then we have a very high
   price set upon it, but not too high a price! Oh, that you and I may
   know how sweet, how precious is the loving kindness of God! And then we
   shall say that it is better than life! And because it is so, my lips
   shall praise You. Not only my heart, but I will do it openly. I

   used to speak vanity when I served vanity. Shall I not now speak out
   for God when I have come to serve Him? My lips shall praise You.

   4. Thus will I bless You while Ilive: I will lift up my hands in Your
   name. I will confess You. I will rejoice in You. I will work for You. I
   will encourage myself in You. I will lift up my hands in Your name. Are
   any of you cast down? Do your hands hang down? Then lift them up in
   God's name! Nothing else can make you strong. The name of the Lord
   shall be your strength!

   5, 6. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness: and my
   mouth shall praise You with joyful lips, when I remember You upon my
   bed, and meditate on You in the night watches. God's people know what
   perfect satisfaction means. When God reveals His love to them and
   Christ draws near in the fullness of His Grace, then they would not
   change places with all the kings of the earth! Not all the richest
   dainties that were ever served up at royal banquets are equal to the
   love of God! My soul, not my body, but my inmost self, my very life,
   shall be satisfied, even as with marrow and with fatness. The
   Oriental's idea of luxury is to eat fat. How they will eat what we
   cannot endure! But we, dear Friends, understand the metaphor and
   appreciate what is meant by David. God will satisfy us with the best of
   the best, with marrow and fatness. He will make that satisfaction
   double as with marrow and fatness! And we shall be so satisfied that we
   shall have nothing left to do but to praise. "My mouth shall praise."
   Says our poet--

   "All that remains for me Is but to love and sing, And wait until the
   angels come To bear me to their King!"

   He that wrote that verse knew what was meant by this, "My soul shall be
   satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise You
   with joyful lips."

   7. Because You have been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings
   will I rejoice. That is God's logic. One likes to see "therefores" in
   Scripture. They are inferences drawn with great accuracy. You have been
   my Helper. Well, then, You will be my Helper! And if I cannot see Your
   face, I will rejoice in the shadow of Your wings. I know that You are
   there, even if I cannot see You. And if I only know that You are there
   by the shade that You cast over me--that calming, cooling shade which
   dampens the ardor of my worldly spirit--if this is all that I get from
   You, yet in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice!

   8. My soul follows hard after You. I am after You, my God, hard after
   You, following hard after You, longing for You like a dog at the heels
   of his master's horse, going with all his might, following hard after
   You! Oh, this is a healthy condition to be in! If you cannot yet reach
   your God, yet if you follow hard after Him, it is well with you, for
   notice the next sentence.

   8. Your right hand upholds me.No man follows after God unless God helps
   him to do so. It comes of the Grace of God. When you are seeking God,
   it is because God is seeking you! And though you know it not, there is
   a vast amount of Grace couched in a desire.

   9, 10. But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
   lower parts of the earth They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a
   portion for foxes. Or jackals, as his name did become.

   11. But the king shall rejoice in God; everyone that swears by Him
   shall glory; but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
   Very hard work to stop them, though, for they are always breaking out
   in fresh places. They have always some new falsehood. A shovelful of
   earth will do it, if nothing else will. Let everyone listen who is
   accustomed to slander, or to speak evil of his neighbor--listen to this
   prophetic voice--"The mouth of them that speak lies shall be
   stopped."But the mouths that speak the praises of God shall go on
   singing forever and ever! May such mouths be ours.

The Light of the World

   (No. 3534)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE PULPIT, NEWINGTON

   "Then spoke Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world;
   he who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light
   of life." John 8:12.

   OUR Lord did not speak in this way at the beginning of His ministry. He
   did not thus bear witness to Himself, saying, "I am the light of the
   world." But it was befitting on this occasion, when the people before
   Him had already received sufficient evidence from other quarters. John
   the Baptist, whom all men counted for a Prophet, had testified that
   Christ was the true Light of God which lights every man that comes into
   the world. The witness of John they rejected-- startling, if not
   conclusive, as it must have been--considering the esteem in which his
   oracular voice was held. Moreover, Jesus, Himself, had worked
   conviction in their hearts by His teaching. Had they not listened to
   His famous Sermon on the Mount? Could they not feel the authority with
   which He spoke? Did they not confess to the impressions He produced on
   them? The weight and the wisdom of His discourse manifested a power
   that could melt their thoughts into the very mold of His ministry. Nor
   was it merely His teaching, transparent though that was, but the signs
   He showed and the miracles He worked with the majesty of His voice and
   the virtue of His touch proclaimed that He was the Light of the world!
   Thus the infirmities of the creature called forth His Divine
   compassion. With radiant eyes of pity He looked on the wretched and
   gave them quick relief--He shone on their sadness like the Sun of
   Righteousness, with healing in His beams. They hailed His visit in
   every town and village as the Healer of all who were diseased. Might
   not the quick sense of every unprejudiced spectator detect in Him the
   Messiah and welcome His advent to the worlds? At length, as though
   aggrieved by their unbelief, He speaks loudly and proclaims plainly, "I
   am the light of the world." Such high ground does He take before His
   adversaries. Well might He say it to their teeth. Hardly an hour before
   He had flashed that Light into their eyes and blinded them with its
   brilliance! They had stood before Him, with the unhappy woman whom they
   sought to make the instrument of entangling Him, and soon they had
   sneaked out of His Presence conscience-stricken, when He said, "He that
   is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone at her." One ray
   of His Omniscience had lighted up the secret chambers of their memory
   and exposed, at least to themselves, the righteous Law they had broken,
   and the crimes they had to answer for. He who could thus convince them,
   is able to convince the world of sin! He who lit up the deepest
   recesses of the heart is the Light of the world! So Jesus here boldly
   and openly avowed the truth concerning Himself when He said, "I am the
   light of the world."

   Let our meditation now be directed to our Lord Jesus Christ as the
   Light of the world--the true Light--the guiding Light--and the
   universal Light!

   I. JESUS IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD.

   That Jesus is the Light--the Light of the world--is to be seen in all
   parts of His blessed history. Look at Him in His cradle. Shines there a
   star above the house wherein the young Child sleeps? Brighter far than
   yonder star is He, who lies cradled in the manger! He has come, the
   predictions of whose Advent had illumined centuries of darkness! As a
   Baby, devout men hail Him, "A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the
   glory of His people Israel." To the eye of faith, what radiance
   emanates from the new-born Baby! Look, for the like was never looked on
   before! There God is veiled in human flesh. Behold the mystery of the
   Incarnation! God is manifest in our nature! He dwells among us. The
   Light is clear and dazzling.

   Well might the angels have, sung, "Glory to God in the highest; on
   earth peace, goodwill towards men." Sweet Baby! You have pierced the
   thick darkness of earth's sorrow! You have enlightened her scenes of
   sadness, infusing joy into

   her gloom! Your coming revealed the love of God, His sweet compassion
   and His tender pity towards the guilty sons of men. With growing years,
   while His increasing wisdom kept pace with His increasing stature, He
   shone, exhibiting a Child's delight in the two tables of the Law. His
   first concern being to do His heavenly Father's business and His
   constant habit being to submit Himself and to honor His earthly parent.
   Not rashly or recklessly did He begin to teach. His Baptism throws a
   wonderful light upon consecration to God--and the dire temptations that
   quickly followed, in all of which He foiled the tempter--have thrown a
   brilliant light on the pathway of Christian ministers! As a Preacher,
   He was luminous. He expounded the spirituality of the Law of God. Light
   penetrated the precept through and through as He made the very essence
   of purity apparent! His Light cleared the Law of the mists and fogs
   that the Rabbinical writers had gathered around it. He shed Light, too,
   upon the Covenant of Grace. He promulgated the Gospel of peace among
   the sons of men. He told of God the Father, willing to receive His
   prodigal children back again into His bosom. His parables threw
   wondrous Light upon the dispensation of the Kingdom of Heaven. His
   counsels and His cautions brought the final destinies of the righteous
   and the wicked into full view. Eternity dawned on His hearers while He
   spoke. His own life exhibited the power of love, the value of sympathy
   and the virtue of forgiving injuries. His death gave yet more palpable
   evidence of unfaltering submission to the will of God--and unflinching
   self-sacrifice for the welfare of men!

   Oh, Beloved, the Light of Christ comes out brightest upon the Cross!
   Someone called it the Lighthouse of this world's sea. So it is. This is
   the Lighthouse that throws its beams across the dark waters of human
   guilt and misery, warns men of the rocks, and guides them to the haven.
   A Savior! God in human flesh! He whom the Seers predicted--"A king
   shall reign in righteousness," appears as the Divine symbol represented
   Him--"a Lamb slain." Behold Him shedding His precious blood to atone
   for the sins of men! Never did such Light shine on the Law and the
   Prophets! Never did such Light gleam on the faith and hope of pure
   hearts! Never did such Light irradiate the repentance and conversion by
   which sinners are retrieved! Behold the Sun as He comes forth from His
   chamber and rejoices to finish His course! He before whose eyes Jesus
   Christ has been evidently set forth crucified, has seen a Light which
   outshines all earthly splendor! The sin and the sorrow, the shame and
   the sentence, all vanish when we see the Redeemer die for us! And if
   from the gloom of His death so much comfort can be extracted, what
   shall we say when He rose again from the dead? His dark se-pulcher
   reflects Glory now that He has arisen from the dead! The shroud, the
   mattock, and the grave are shorn of their terrors--

   "No more a morgue, to fence

   The relics of lost innocence,

   A vault of ruin and decay--

   The imprisoning stone is rolled away."

   Into the sepulcher you can peer now that Christ has broken down the
   door and torn away the veil. Through it you can look. For those that
   follow Christ, it is a passage into everlasting life! He has brought
   life and immortality to light. Since He has risen from the tomb and
   left the dead, the Light of God, clear and transparent, shines on the
   exodus of the soul from earth! On, onward still, track His path as in
   His ascension He goes flaming up the skies! There, there is a road of
   Light that shows us the way to God! He enters Heaven and sits at the
   right hand of the Father. There, as our Representative, He sheds the
   Light of comfort down upon us. There He waits--and while He waits--He
   wills that where He is, there should His people be! Oh, happy thought,
   today, my Brothers and Sisters! Among the sons of men, Christ is still
   the Light. He has sent the Holy Spirit to be His Representative here on
   earth. He testifies of Christ. The Divine Paraclete occupies the place
   of our departed Teacher. The Church, inspired by the blessed Spirit,
   with ten thousand tongues, proclaims the Gospel of salvation. "You are
   the light of the world," said Jesus. In His people, Christ still shines
   forth with even a brighter light than in the days of His earthly
   sojourn! He has ten thousand reflectors, instead of twelve. Ten
   thousand times ten thousand tongues proclaim His Gospel and ten
   thousand times ten thousand hearts burn and blaze with the Light of the
   Divine Word! Christ is the Light of the world! From His cradle to His
   Throne, and onward till He comes in full splendor at the Second Advent,
   the Lamb is the Light of God that illuminates this dark earth! "Then
   spoke Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world."

   II. JESUS IS THE TRUE LIGHT.

   There are other lights. Before His Coming there had been some typical
   light. Do you not remember that a golden lamp stood in the Holy Place,
   with its seven branches? It was an admirable piece of sacred furniture,
   and highly instruc-tive--but Jesus seems to put it away. In fact, it
   had been already put away. He had come to put an end to its meaning by

   fulfilling its intent. "This was not the Light of God--it was only the
   type of the Light. "I am the true light," He says. Even that light
   which flamed across the desert way when Moses led the host of God
   through the wilderness was but a typical light. The veritable Pillar of
   Cloud and Fire is Jesus, who leads the whole host of God's elect
   through this weary wilderness to the Canaan of the blessed!

   Jesus Christ was the true Light in opposition to the smoking flax of
   tradition. Listen to those Rabbis! They think themselves the light of
   the world! Their sophism is an endless strife of words--their research
   is not worth your study-- their knowledge is not worth the knowing!
   They can tell you exactly which is the middle verse of the Bible and
   which is the middle letter of the middle word! They discussed their
   paradoxes till they became addle-headed! They refined on their
   subtleties till doctrine dwindled down into doubt, simple Truth was
   degraded into silly twaddle, their translations of Scripture were a
   travesty and their commentaries an outrage upon commonsense! But
   Christ, the true, the heavenly Light of God, extinguishes all your
   earthly luminaries! The Jewish Rabbi, the Greek philosopher, the
   ecclesiastical father, and the modern theological thinker are meteors
   that dissolve into mist! They make void the Word of God through their
   traditions or their conjectures. Flee away from the nebulous forms and
   noxious fumes of their old traditions and new discoveries! Believe what
   Jesus said, His Apostles taught, and what you have had revealed to you
   in His own pure Word! Christ is the true Light of God!

   In opposition to the glare of priestcraft, with which so many in all
   ages have been enamored, Christ is the Light of the world! There is
   some reason to suppose that this declaration of our Lord bore allusion
   to a custom observed among the Jews at that time in connection with the
   Feast of Tabernacles. Maimonides says that on the previous evening two
   enormous candelabra--golden lamps--of a vast size were set up in the
   court of the women in the open air, and that these flamed with such a
   brilliant light that they appeared to illuminate the whole city of
   Jerusalem. And the women came with a torchlight procession and stood
   around these flaming candelabra, and there executed a sort of sacred
   dance and solemn pageant. This was done, not on the authority of Moses,
   but on the authority of tradition--to keep the people in mind of the
   cloudy and fiery pillar of the wilderness! The Feast of Tabernacles,
   you know, was designed as a memorial of the 40 years that the children
   of Israel wandered in the wilderness, dwelling in tents. But this
   particular rite was of their own invention--a supplementary observance
   intended to remind the people of the fiery pillar that illumined the
   camp in those days of yore. Now it is supposed, not, I think, without
   good reason, that it was on the morning after this celebration that
   Jesus stood in the court. The lamps were gone out, but the golden
   columns that the night before had flamed, still remained in their
   places--the remnant of a spectacle--the lamps minus the light. Just
   then the sun was rising in its own peerless splendor. The scene they
   beheld gave force to the sentence He uttered. The contrast between the
   lamps which the priests had lit--a fit emblem of superstition--were all
   going out, perhaps with a noxious smell, while the mighty orb of day
   was rising when Jesus said, "I am the light of the world; He who
   follows Me shall not walk in darkness." Whether the scene and the
   circumstances were as has been so well imagined, or not, the truth is
   fitly illustrated by the similitude. When every lamp that ever man has
   kindled, and fed with the oil of superstition, shall have died out, as
   they must expire, our Lord Jesus Christ shall, like the morning sun,
   make glad the sons of men! Away you go, you bright meteors of the
   night, around which the children of superstition execute their maddened
   dance of implicit belief! Away you go! Already you begin to go out! I
   see how you all flicker, even now. The day comes on apace in which the
   blast of God's eternal Spirit shall blow you out in everlasting night.
   But Jesus shines! He is the true Light of God and will shine on
   forever! "I live in the twilight of Christianity," said Voltaire, and
   he unwittingly spoke a truth. He thought that it was the twilight of
   the evening, but it was the twilight of the morning, for Jesus still
   shines brighter and brighter--the true Light of God before which the
   lamps of superstition and priestcraft must pale their ineffectual
   fires! This is what the Savior meant--He was the true Light.

   Very different, too, is the Light of Christ from the sparks which are
   to be seen all the world over. Every now and then a scientific
   gentleman picks up a flint arrowhead and he strikes a wonderful light
   with it. And he that has his tinder-box ready and a brimstone match may
   soon think he has got the true light--till another philosopher comes
   and, with the lid of the aforesaid tinderbox, puts out that light! This
   is the cardinal virtue of philosophers--they extinguish one another!
   Their fine spun theories do not often survive the fleeting generation
   that admires them! A fresh race starts fresh theories of unbelief,
   which live their day, like ephemera, and then expire. Not so the Light
   of Christ! It burns on and beams forever! We have friends who have been
   dazed by the light of "public opinion"--a very bright light is that.
   And

   we have known some decent scholars who have been enraptured with "the
   light of the 19th Century"--a wonderful luminary, indeed, but slightly
   darkened by the follies, frauds and crimes which every day's newspaper
   reveals! We have had the light of knowledge which lauded Aristotle, and
   made the heathen author supply a textbook for Christian colleges! We
   have heard more than enough of the light of the Church in which we can
   discern nothing but colors and conceits, borrowed from the medieval
   darkness of Christendom. But we have the trustworthy and the true when
   we hear Him exclaim, "I am the light." Where else shall light be found?
   Where shall the bewildered sons of men find a reliable guide? In the
   teaching of the Person, the Life, the Death, the Sacrifice of the
   Christ of Nazareth, we have the Light of God self-evidential, palpable
   by its own brilliance! Guiding Light is here, alike, clearly visible.
   This to follow is not fallacious. "I am the light of the world; He that
   follows Me shall not walk in darkness." Thus, then, is He a Light that
   is to be followed! Do any of you want to enjoy the light that streams
   from Christ? Be assured you cannot realize it by reading about it--you
   must follow it! If a man could travel so fast as always to follow the
   sun, of course he would always be in the light. If the day should ever
   come when the speed of the railway shall be equal to the speed of the
   world's motion, then a man may so live as to never lose the light. Now
   he that follows Christ shall never walk in darkness! To follow Him
   means to commit yourselves to Him, to believe Him and yield yourselves
   up--obediently doing what He bids--and implicitly accepting what He
   says. You must have no other Master. Say not, "I will be taught by
   Calvin," or, "by Luther," or, "by Wesley," or, "by someone else." Jesus
   Christ, only, must be your Light! His Word, by the testimony of His
   Spirit, must be your sole authority!

   III. JESUS IS THE GUIDING LIGHT FOR THE SOUL. For the soul that pants
   after God. Do you say, with Philip, "show us the Father, and it
   suffices us"? Jesus says, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no
   man comes unto the Father but by Me." Christ is the guiding light
   through the multitude of authors. If you want to thread your way among
   them, let the early Fathers, the sturdy Reformers, the rigid Puritans
   and the modern Evangelists be your companions, if it so please you. But
   let Him be your Guide and His counsel your stay till you reach the
   gates of Glory. Amidst the conflict of opinions, His sure Word will
   prove your safe chart! He is the guiding Light through sickness and
   suffering--trust Him, and He will make your bed in your sickness--He
   will bring lasting benefits out of your most lamentable afflictions. He
   is the guiding Light through death's dark vale. In those gloomy shades
   you need fear no ill if you keep close to Him--

   "Sun of my Soul, You Savior dear, It is not night if You are near."
   Christ has said, "He that follows Me shall not walk in darkness"--so
   the terror of night flies at His Presence! The atoning blood shall
   speak peace to you. Ignorance shall vanish before the brightness He
   manifests. Christ shall teach you. Despair shall dissolve before the
   sweet beams of hope. Even doubt, with all the indecision that comes of
   it, melts at the sound of His animating voice, "This is the way; walk
   you in it." Thrice happy the man who commits himself to Jesus! He shall
   always have the Light of God and shall never walk in darkness!

   IV. JESUS IS THE UNIVERSAL LIGHT.

   He says, "I am the light of the world." He does not merely say, "I am
   the light of the Jews," or, "I am the light of the Gentiles." He is
   both. He is the Light of all mankind! There is no clear light in which
   any man can discern God, or rightly understand himself, perceive the
   bitterness of sin, or apprehend the destiny and the doom of Heaven and
   Hell, but what flows through Jesus Christ! I do not doubt that among
   the various religious professions spread over the world--in many of
   which Christianity is much debased--there are devout persons who enjoy
   a share of communion with God and a sense of pardoned sin, though the
   tone of their thoughts, like the tongue of their utterances, widely
   differs from our own--but it is all through one common Lord, our
   Savior, Jesus Christ, they find acceptance! When I get hold of a book
   that teaches erroneous things, yet if there is a savor of Jesus Christ
   in it, I censure the faults without condemning the author. Never let my
   strong criticisms be mistaken for anathemas. I sometimes perceive that
   the man who wrote it has evidently found salvation because he has laid
   hold of our Lord Jesus Christ. He that follows Him is on the right
   tack. Though he may err in a thousand minor considerations, by
   following Christ in the main thing, he is safe. Learn of Him and obey
   Him in all things--then shall you be blessed, yourself, and useful to
   others! Happy the man who has seen this Light and walks in this Light
   of Christ, for "this is the light that lights every man that comes into
   the world!" There is a little Light in Mohammedanism. Indeed,
   considering the age in which Mohammed lived, he had a great deal of
   Light-- the religion of the Koran is immeasurably superior to the
   religions of the age in which the prophet flourished. He even

   taught the Unity of the Godhead most clearly. Yet the light in the
   Koran is borrowed from the Old and New Testament. It is borrowed light.
   The intelligence is pilfered. The light of the Parsee, the light of
   Zoroaster, the light of Confucius came originally from the sacred books
   of the Jews. From one source they must have all come, for all light
   comes from the great Father of Lights. Wherever you alight upon any
   truth in strange places about man's state and condition, or about God
   and the way to safety, you may rest assured that the light, if tracked
   to its dawn, would lead you up to Jesus Christ--for all the true Light
   comes from Him.

   Christ is the Light of the world, destined to shed His beams over the
   whole earth. The day comes when all mankind will see this Light. How
   often I have been told of late that the world is all going to rack and
   ruin, and that all that we ought to do is to try and man a lifeboat and
   save a few strugglers, hastening ourselves to leave the wreck before
   she breaks up! Well now, I am not so desponding as that. I am of
   opinion that, by God's good Grace, we shall tug the old vessel off the
   rocks, and that the kingdoms of this world will become the Kingdoms of
   our God and of His Christ, for the Lord has sworn that all flesh shall
   see the salvation of God! I cannot believe that this dispensation will
   be wound up as a tremendous failure, that the Gospel zealously preached
   everywhere shall result in only a few being saved, and that the whole
   economy shall go out in darkness as the snuff of a candle is
   extinguished. No, I look for better things! They who dwell in the
   wilderness shall bow before Him and His enemies shall lick the dust.
   The isles shall bring Him tribute. Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts,
   yes, all kings shall fall down before Him. I cannot help believing that
   the Gospel is yet to be triumphant. I look for the coming of Christ.
   Let Him come when He may, our hearts will leap for joy to greet Him!
   But for this dispensation to end without success would almost seem to
   me like thwarting the purposes of God. It is not His way in the world.
   He has deliberately entered into battle with Satan, choosing poor
   feeble instruments like ourselves to confound the forces confronted
   against Him! And if He should withdraw His troops from the field, or
   come, Himself, to the front and take up the fight single-handed which
   His chosen legions could not conduct, it would look as if He had not
   wisely foreseen the engagement, or had needed to alter His plans to
   compass His ends! His Spirit can inspire inveterate feebleness with
   irresistible force. He can use means without miracles, or He can work
   wonders without wantonness. His first act foretold auspiciously. The
   twelve Apostles, like a little compact square of grenadiers to fight
   against the foe, is no ill omen! It surely does not mean that the
   battle shall not end till the enemy has turned his back and fled!
   Moreover, He keeps on sending fresh battalions. He raises up new traps
   and, every now and then, when the battle seems to waver, He recruits
   the ranks and sends out new enlistments, strengthening the ranks that
   are thinned and harassing the enemy with His reserves. Courage, my
   Brothers and Sisters! There shall be revival after revival! There shall
   be reformation after reformation, shock of battle after shock of
   battle, and the dread artillery of God's great Gospel shall be fired
   off against the hosts of Hell! The gods of the heathen shall fall.
   Antichrist shall be overthrown! Babylon shall sink, like a millstone,
   in the flood. The crescent of Mohamed must wane into eternal darkness!
   Israel shall behold her King, and the fullness of the Gentiles shall be
   gathered at His feet. So let our faith excite our courage, our courage
   stimulate our patience and our patience give zest to the full assurance
   of hope while we worship our Lord Jesus Christ as the Light of the
   world!

   Thus have I carried out my design of amplifying on the four points that
   I propounded to you at the outset. Let me wind up with a personal
   question--Since Christ is the Light of the world, I would ask--

   V. HOW ARE WE ACTING TOWARDS HIM?

   Do any of us shun the Light? I know some men slight the privileges they
   ought to prize. They do not want to know Him whose going forth is as
   the light of the morning when the sun rises. They never read the Bible,
   or search into the history, the prophecy and the promises. They do not
   like an earnest ministry. They have a sort of happy-go-lucky style of
   religion--they take in whatever anybody else tells them--they attend
   their place of worship as a matter of habit, and observe all the
   proprieties of fashion. But as to doing right or seeking the Light of
   God, they seldom or never give it a thought! They do not count it
   desirable. Too much of the Light of God could expose much that would
   not bear inspection. Dear Friend, if you are afraid of the Light of
   God, be suspicious of yourself, for it is deceit that dreads detection!
   Who are the people who like darkness rather than light? If it were put
   to a meeting of the inhabitants of London, who would vote for putting
   out the gas at night? Well, I guarantee you, every burglar would! Every
   murderer would--and there are certain libertines who would rather like
   it. Every man that does evil hates the light! I do not mean to compare
   you with those gentlemen. Still, the saying is very comprehensive, "He
   that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light lest his
   deeds should be reproved." Of course, when some men sneer, we can
   appreciate their sensitiveness. The Doc-

   trine of Christ does not suit the dissolute. Lax living never does lead
   up to an admiration of pure piety. What a price the profligate have to
   pay for their pleasures! Are you, my Friend, conscious of anything you
   need to conceal? Look closely at it. Recollect that you will have to
   look at it in that Great Day when the secrets of all hearts will be
   exposed. When Jesus comes "to judge the world with righteousness and
   His people with equity," from the light ofjustice, from the heat of
   judgment, nothing whatever shall be hid! Be wise, therefore, to repent
   now of the evil, lest calamity reach you when there is none to
   commiserate.

   Do I see a curl of the lip, a shrug of the shoulder, a cynical
   expression of the countenance, as someone asks, "Are we really, then,
   to regard the Christ you speak of, the Atonement you preach, the
   resurrection you are so confident about, as the Light of the present
   age, the Light of other ages--in fact, the Light of the world?" You put
   it well, my Friend, and you look well as you ask the question. It
   occurs to me that I might meet you in altered circumstances, when your
   tone would be altered likewise. Flesh is frail. Your eyes will not be
   always full of luster. Your spirits will not be always blithe and gay.
   Your health will not be always strong and vigorous. Not yet have you
   felt your need of the Light of God which has irradiated past ages, can
   enlighten this age and will shine with undiminished Glory in the
   everlasting age! Proud man, are you a philosopher or a politician? Are
   you a man of science, or a mere pretender? Know this, that in darkness
   you did enter this world--years passed before you dreamed that life had
   a purpose and in darkness, still denser--you must make your exit, if,
   pleased with a fancy or enamored of a fallacy, you fail to see the
   Light that makes time and eternity resplendent! When we preach the
   Gospel purely and simply, we seem to be challenging the question on the
   part of some of you. To what purpose? The Light of God we propound, you
   do not need! How can I answer you? No arguments of mine will avail
   while you are blind to the perils you must meet with in traversing
   those unknown paths and untried experiences that lie before you! And as
   to the objections that any of you raise, let the man that takes
   objection to God's counsel and spurns His kindness, answer for the
   rashness he will have to rue!

   Petty scruples! Paltry excuses! They betray your insincerity! It is
   absurd to trifle when the outlook might well make you tremble to plead
   for yourselves. You will not put your cause in the hands of the
   Counselor. Hence the gloom that comes of your doubts! Hence the
   wretchedness of a sinner's reflections on the Grace of his Redeemer! Do
   you quibble at the Light of God? Do you know the reason why? Well, I
   think it is for very much the same reason that made the Brahmin break
   the microscope. He thought it wicked to destroy life of any kind. He
   would not eat meat, or feed upon flesh, fish, or fowl, for anybody who
   destroyed life would destroy his own soul. "Well," said a missionary,
   "but you must do violence to your own conscience every time you drink,
   for the water you swallow teems with animalcule--living, moving
   creatures." Then he showed him a drop of water magnified by a
   microscope. The evidence was clear, but instead of yielding to
   conviction, the Brahmin was enraged at the instrument which worked the
   discovery, so he broke the microscope! In like manner, men despise and
   attempt to disprove the Gospel because it reveals Truths of God that
   are unwelcome. It explodes their traditions! It disparages their
   opinions, it debases their cherished tastes and so it destroys their
   peace of mind! It will not let them live comfortably in sin. The love
   of sin and superstition, a zeal for your clan and your craft, animate
   your opposition to malevolence and madness! I think I hear somebody
   say, "I wish I could see it." Well, dear Friend, I wish I could credit
   your candor. The Light of God that streams from Christ is visible, but
   not to eyes that are shut! Not to hearts that are hardened! Not to
   consciences that are seared! "Open your eyes--it is all you have to
   do." Look, Sinner--look and live! All around you is the Light of
   everlasting Love. Do but open those poor eyes of yours that unbelief
   has kept closed so long! O Lord, open the sinner's eyes that he may now
   see! The Light of God is all around you, Brother! The Light is all
   around you, Sister! Others see it and rejoice. Only let your eyes be
   opened, and you shall hail the glorious orb which makes manifest all
   that is obscure and awful to your present apprehension!

   Have you seen the Light? Is there one who says? "Well, thank God, I
   have seen that Light"? Then, dear Brother, dear Sister, be grateful and
   give thanks! We are, none of us, as thankful as we ought to be for the
   Light that shines in the face of Jesus Christ. There was a custom on
   the Alps in the olden time, which, I fear, has dropped into disuse.
   Someone was appointed to stand upon the topmost Alp with a great cow
   horn, and as soon as he beheld the rising of the sun, with a loud blast
   he gave notice. From peak to peak of the Alps might then be heard, in
   those good old days, a Psalm of praise! Oh, you happy souls that have
   beheld the rising of the Sun of Righteousness, tell it forth with
   trumpet tongue! Well may a thousand voices take up His praise! Blessed
   be the name of Jesus! Forever be His name adored! Magnify His Grace for
   the Light that shines, for the goodness it diffuses--for the joy, the
   abounding joy, it awakens on every side!

   And now, Brothers and Sisters, let gratitude and benevolence prompt
   your zeal to spread the Light, to reflect it all around, near and far!
   I am very anxious that all the members of this Church should endeavor
   to disseminate the Light of the knowledge of Christ which has shone in
   their own hearts. I pray you, Brothers and Sisters, do not get cold,
   formal, or indifferent. The Truth of God you have believed through
   Grace is a precious trust committed to your charge. You have been a
   praying people, and you are still so--blessed be God's name. Do not
   forsake the Prayer Meetings--frequent them regularly and conspire
   together to make them still more full of life and energy. I have been
   known to say with honest gratitude that most, if not all, the members
   in fellowship with us were actually engaged in some work for Jesus. Is
   it so now? Are you all interested and occupied in telling and teaching
   the good news and the great lessons of the Gospel? We have no notion of
   leaving to pastors the whole work of the Christian ministry in which
   every faithful disciple should take earnest part. One man, alone,
   perhaps, may preach to such a throng as this, but if we are to have
   preaching everywhere, you must all preach by word and deed to circulate
   the heavenly wisdom in every sphere of earthly resort!

   Oh, my Sisters and my Brothers, the best of all preaching, because the
   most simple and unostentatious, is to be found in the ordinary
   communion you hold with your fellow creatures when, with a good
   conversation, you avail yourselves of all the occurrences and
   opportunities of daily life! In your families the sweetness of your
   temper, the gentleness of your manners and the purity of your actions
   should bear witness that you have been with Jesus and learned of Him.
   The integrity of your business habits should speak for the sanctity of
   your morals and commend the school in which you have been trained. Your
   character must be clear, or the utterance of your lips will be
   despised. Then an outspoken testimony will take hold of men's hearts.
   Tell your children, your brothers, your sisters, and your intimate
   friends the way to Jesus! Tell the strangers who sit by your side, if
   you can, something of your own sweet experience of the Light of God
   that there is in Jesus! God has recently taken away some of our best
   workers, as you know. Oh, Brothers and Sisters, make up for the loss of
   one of the best of men, long known as a deacon and Elder in our midst,
   who is now laid aside--his health departed, his strength prostrate. Oh,
   Sisters, try to make up by double energy for the loss of that good
   Sister who was a mother among you all! Oh, let us all see to it that
   there are no gaps in the ranks of Christ's army which are not quickly
   filled up with fresh recruits! If there should happen to be a vacancy,
   and the man has fallen who stood next to me, I will try, by God's
   strength, to fight with both hands at this time till some other shall
   step up to take his place. Since Christ is our Light and He has
   ordained us to be lights in the world, let us shine to the utmost of
   our capacity until the Master shall take us to dwell with Him in the
   Light of God forever! Amen.

Safe, Though Surrounded By Sin

   (No. 3535)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   AUGUST 8, 1869.

   "Unto You will I cry, O Lord, my Rock. Do not be silent to me, lest if
   You are silent to me, I become like those who go down to the pit."
   Psalm 28:1.

   [The original title of this sermon was SAFE, THOUGH SIN-SURROUNDED]

   I HAVE no doubt that the first and most natural meaning of these words
   is this, that David passed through such mental distress, such
   accumulated grief, that unless his prayer should bring him consolation
   from Heaven, he felt that he must despair and so become like those who
   sink into everlasting despair, going down into the pit of Hell. I think
   it is a cry against his misery which vexed him--an earnest petition
   that he might not have to suffer so long as to drive him into that same
   despair which is the eternal inheritance of lost souls.

   But in reading the other day Masillon's Reflections of the Psalms, I
   noticed that that eminent French preacher gives quite another turn to
   the passage, and he seems to regard this as being the prayer of David
   when he was exposed to the association of the ungodly, fearful lest he
   should become in character like those that go down into the pit, and
   even if that should not be the first meaning of the text, it seems to
   me to be a natural inference from it, and if not, still the thought,
   itself, is one which contains so much of holy caution about it that I
   desire to commend it to all my Brothers and Sisters in Christ Jesus
   tonight, and especially to such as are usually exposed to danger from
   evil society. We will begin, then, by remarking that--

   I. MANY OF THE BEST OF GOD'S SAINTS ARE CALLED IN THE ORDER OF
   PROVIDENCE TO BE TRIED BY EVIL COMPANIONSHIP.

   "I pray not that You should take them out of the world," said Christ,
   "but that You should keep them from the Evil One." Hence we are not
   shut up in monasteries or nunneries. We have not to--

   "Lodge in some vast wilderness, Some boundless contiguity of shade." We
   are placed in the midst of our fellow men! We are not even placed among
   a selected body of men, but for the most part we are thrown down in the
   midst of society and, in the case of some, the society which they must
   inevitably keep is of the very worst and most dangerous kind. I say
   that first of all. This is, in a measure, the case with all, or nearly
   all of us. We are placed in a world in which there is nothing that is
   friendly to Grace, but everything that is opposed to the spiritual
   life. That man must be very happily circumstanced, indeed, who does not
   find himself a stranger in a strange land, and a foreigner among aliens
   who do not understand him! Go out into the world at all, and you have
   need to put your armor on, for it is an enemy's country. There is no
   profession, no form of labor, no walk of life, no publicity, no
   retirement in which the Christian is not, in some measure, exposed to
   the deteriorating influence of ungodly society. As long as we are in
   this world, it must, in a measure, be so. There are few, indeed, who
   are screened from this danger, but there are some who are peculiarly
   exposed to it--some in the highest walks of life. It is not easy to be
   a Christian and to be among the great. "Gold and the Gospel," said John
   Bunyan very truly, "seldom agree." The high mountains are cold. The
   tops of the hills--the tempest sweeps along them. We have had mournful
   examples, lately, that the most eminent rank does not secure morality
   or guidance, even by the rules of commonsense. I have been inclined,
   lately, when I have read the papers, to interpret the term, "the scum
   of society," to refer to those who float on the top, for certainly
   there is no rank of society that could have figured more abominably in
   the Divorce Court, no rank of society that could have exhibited itself
   so detestably upon the racecourse, than the peerage of this realm! And
   unless God mends the manners of the Right Hono-

   rables, their names will have to be Right Abominables--the term will be
   more suitable to them by far! It is difficult, depend upon it, to be
   great and to be good! No man need, then, be very ambitious to climb to
   the high places. Brains swim when risen aloft, that had been calm
   enough below. Be contented where you are, and rest satisfied with
   Agar's portion, who prayed, "Give me neither poverty nor riches."

   It must be difficult, too, for a man to keep himself free from the
   contamination of company in what are called the lowest ranks. Oh, how
   many of you, Christian Brothers, there are, the sons of toil--pure, and
   good, and holy men-- who have tomorrow morning to go and mix with those
   who insert almost every sentence with an oath! I remember it was the
   complaint of one of our Sisters in the Poor House, not that the diet
   was sparse, not that the bed was hard, but that the language used by
   those with whom she must associate vexed her soul! Only in the lowest
   ranks men do not cover up their profanity. They have not learned that
   politeness which can blaspheme God secretly, but they speak right out
   their enmity and they couch their offensive thoughts of the Most High
   in the most offensive words! And hence the people of God thrust into
   such society are like holy Lot in the midst of Sodom who was vexed with
   the filthy conversation of the ungodly! Oh, dear young people, be very
   thankful, you that are yet nestling under the wing of parental care and
   have not to go into a rough and wicked world! I am afraid for some of
   you good young creatures to join the Church, lest your piety should not
   stand the test of this rough world, when you must, by-and-by, be thrust
   out into it! And you, my Brothers and Sisters, who, through the
   goodness of Providence are kept from being exposed to the temptations
   peculiar to the extremes of life, be very grateful, but, as you have
   less to contend with in this respect, bring forth more fruit unto God
   and seek to be more eminent Christians because of the advantages of
   your circumstances!

   Yet Brothers and Sisters, I may as well come back to where I started. I
   suppose that we are, all of us, in whatever way of life we may be
   walking, exposed more or less to the associations of those who are not
   the servants of Christ. What business could a man select in which he
   would find that all with whom he had to deal were Christians? If there
   were, indeed, a parish of All Saints, it might be a very desirable
   place for residence, though I hardly know whether any man would be
   right in going to live there, since God's objective in making saints on
   earth at all is that by casting them like salt in the midst of the
   earth, they may work for good and savor the mass. You must, you must
   mix, more or less, with those who will tempt you! Do not be in a hurry,
   therefore, to change your position in life. If it is not, in itself,
   sinful--in case it is so, give it up tomorrow--but if it is not, in
   itself, sinful, stand not aghast at its peculiar temptations! There are
   temptations elsewhere. You may go from the frying pan into the fire, as
   the old proverb has it, very readily. In getting out of one temptation,
   you may soon get into another and, on the whole, probably the
   temptation that is troubling you most is the best that you can have. It
   is the temptation that would not trouble you that would be the most
   dangerous, and when a man's cross has been long on his shoulder, it
   begins to fit him--and he had better not change it for another. In
   every condition it is your lot to be crying to God for help, but do not
   be earnest to get out of the fire. This much the first point, then. The
   second is this. It appears from the text that--

   II. THE GREAT DANGER OF GOOD MEN IS LEST THEY SHOULD BECOME LIKE THE
   UNGODLY

   THROUGH ASSOCIATION WITH THEM.

   Brothers and Sisters, I shall speak very much from observation, actual
   observation and, I fear, also partly from personal experience, when I
   briefly describe the way in which association with the ungodly tends to
   make Christians like they are.

   First, it too frequently happens that the Christian's testimony is
   silenced. We always try to make excuses for not doing what it is
   disagreeable to do. Now it is the duty of the Christian, wherever he
   may be, to bear witness for his Lord, but self-love and the love of
   ease come in and they say, "You must not make religion offensive! You
   must not cast your pearls before swine--you must not bore people with
   your godliness." This is said to be prudent and, to a great extent, it
   is prudent, but it is the easiest thing in all the world to think that
   we are prudent when we are really cowardly--and to make it out that we
   are using judgment when, instead thereof, we are only trying to protect
   ourselves from the sneers and jeers of the wicked! It is an easy thing
   only to bear witness for our Lord in the midst of those who thank us
   for so doing and who confirm our testimony--but to stand out for Christ
   before the congregation of the wicked--this is not so easy a task and
   oftentimes, when the good man has found himself in evil company, he has
   been tempted, as he thinks by a due regard for prudence, not to say
   anything for his Lord and Master. Now, in this, you become like they
   who go down into the pit of Hell! They do not praise God. They are
   silent about Christ. They talk not of the preciousness of His blood--
   they speak not of His eternal and unchangeable love. You speak not,
   either, and therein you become like they. Who shall tell the difference
   when both are silent?

   The next stage is when the Christian does actually fear, though he may
   not think he does, the sneers of his associates. You are like they the
   moment you are afraid of them! They have discovered in you a likeness
   to themselves the moment you tremble at them! But there are some
   tongues so foul, some whose wit is so sharp, whose remarks are so
   sarcastic that it is not to be quite marveled at that Christians are
   afraid to be thorough Christians in their presence! And yet, my
   Brothers and Sisters, what is there to be afraid of in the greatest man
   that ever breathed? What is there in our holy Christianity that we wish
   to cover up, to conceal in the presence of the most skeptical, the most
   witty, the most severe of the sons of men? Who are you that you should
   be afraid of man and the son of man who is but as a moth or a worm?
   Your Lord has given you in charge His precious Truth, and to live out
   that Truth of God in your own proper character--and will you, for fear
   of a feeble man, hide and conceal, and cover up with a bushel the Light
   your God has given you? Ah, then this is, indeed, to become like they,
   for they who fear man more than God make man their god! And what is
   this but to be idolatrous and to be godless? God deliver us from this!

   Another tendency will next crop up, and that is the inclination in
   Christian people to just yield a point or two. We are told that we must
   not be too precise and severe. Have I not often heard words like these,
   "If we exhibit too much of the Puritanism of religion, we shall
   probably disgust those with whom we associate--and more especially
   youthful minds will be repelled by the severity of our piety"? Oh, I
   could laugh, if I did not weep, when I hear men talk so, for to tell me
   that in this age there is any fear of any man being too severely
   Puritanical is to assert the thing that is not! It is a lax age. Their
   tackling is loosed, the old landmarks are pulled up! Principles--why,
   what do men care for principles, nowadays? There is no fear of being
   too tight and too precise, and if it were not so in this age, yet since
   we serve a jealous God we need never be afraid that we can be too
   jealous of our own hearts! George the Third, in his older days, did
   some very curious things which, very frequently, made people think him
   insane--but there was a kind of method in all his madness! One day he
   met a Quaker gentleman, and accosted him, and was introduced to his
   wife. George said, "And are you one of the Society of Friends, Madam?"
   She said she was. "Isn't there a little too much lace there" he said,
   putting his hand on some portion of her dress. She said, "Well, I have
   deviated a little from strictness, I am sorry to say." "And I am sorry
   to see it, Madam," he said, "for when people once get away from their
   strictness, they generally go a very long way from it." And there is
   very much truth in that. Albeit I am not speaking now about dress, but
   merely quote it as an instance, still, it is so, that when Christian
   people tolerate a little sin, they will tolerate a great sin--and when
   they give up some little point of virtue, they will give up some great
   point. "No," says the thief. "I do not mean to break open that door!
   No, I do not mean to try and force my way into that house." There is a
   little window, just a little window there, and here is a very little
   boy, and you mean to put him in? "Yes," and when that little boy is in,
   he opens the big door, and the burglar enters! And it is so with the
   Church of God. Some little sin, as men will have it--some little
   deflection from the rigid line of right is tolerated--and then the door
   is open and all manner of mischief comes in thereby. God grant that we
   may not, by giving way here and there, pull down the bulwarks of our
   Church and so make the children of God to become like those that go
   down into the pit of Hell!

   There is a point, my Brothers and Sisters, I would bring before you in
   which oftentimes, I am afraid, Christians become like ungodly men--and
   that is in joining in a laugh over a jest which almost compels
   laughter, but which is not altogether clean. George Herbert tells us
   that in a jest we should take the wit, but leave out that which is
   evil, for--

   "He pares his apple that would cleanly feed," but it is not always easy
   to pare the apple just at the time. When a Christian in company is seen
   to laugh over a doubtful jest, he has committed himself far farther
   than he thinks. It were much better if he drew himself up and said, "I
   could laugh with you at what little wit may sparkle in that quotation,
   but I cannot endorse the sentiment with which it is accompanied, nor
   allow it to pass without entering my protest against it." Do we always
   do so? I am afraid that almost always we neglect the doing of that and,
   in that respect, we become like those that go down into the pit of
   Hell.

   Ah, Brothers and Sisters, how easy it is for us to fall little by
   little into the ways of the ungodly, to get to do as they do, and talk
   as they talk, and act as they act--and though on the Sabbath we take a
   different rule, yet on the weekday how much is the life of the
   professed Christian like that of the ungodly? I am not here to impeach
   the common Christianity of the age, but, if I were, what an impeachment
   might be brought against it! It is, alas, too true that many a
   tradesman who is a professing Christian is no more to be trusted than
   his infidel neighbor--that the Christian merchant is not proof against
   the injurious influence of the custom of his trade! We have had good
   men, whom, God forbid, that we should censure too severely, who ought
   to have stood out against the methods of mercantile finance in years
   gone by, but who fell into the custom of the rest and, therefore, the
   worldcan scarcely condemn them, but from the judgment of the

   Christian teacher, they cannot go unscathed! They ought to have known
   and to have done better. It is no excuse for a Christian that it was
   the custom of the business! He has no right to make himself the slave
   of men, nor yield to custom. Follower of Christ, independence of mind
   in carrying out integrity of purpose is that which you are bound to
   exhibit-- and which the Holy Spirit will help you to achieve! May the
   day come when it shall not be our sorrowful task to have to utter such
   sentiments, but we are obliged to utter them now! And we beg Believers
   here to put up the prayer, and pray tonight that God would let His
   voice be heard in your hearts, lest you should become like they who go
   down into the pit

   of Hell!

   Brothers, just one moment here. There is nothing more horrible that I
   know of than that a man who professes to have been washed in the blood
   of Christ should defile himself as others do! What a dishonor to that
   dear name before which the angels bow, that we who wear it should act
   as Christ's enemies do! Paul says, "I tell you, even weeping, that
   there are some who are the enemies of the Cross of Christ, for their
   god is their belly; their end is destruction; they glory in their
   shame"--and these were professors! Nothing can be worse for the
   Church--nothing more disastrous to the world--than for Christians to
   become like the unconverted! The flood came upon the earth when the
   sons of God entered into alliance with the daughters of men. The day of
   chastisement is always near the day of sin--and the day when the godly
   assimilate with the Christless will be the prelude of the great
   overwhelming flood of fire that shall sweep away the earth! Do let us,
   if we would bless our age, be firm for the right and for the Truth of
   God! If we would be happy, ourselves, if we would honor and glorify
   Christ, let our prayer constantly be that we may not be as the wicked
   are. But I must not tarry longer, for I have to notice, in concluding--

   III. THE REMEDY TO WHICH DAVID RESORTED AGAINST THE DANGEROUS TENDENCY
   WHICH HE FELT.

   David was a great deal better man than we might have expected him to be
   in the position he occupied. When you hear persons condemn the glaring
   fall of David, you may join in their condemnation, but you may also ask
   them to remember the remarkable circumstances in which David was found.
   The sin which David committed, great and grievous as it was, was all
   too common--what if I say isall too common--in a soldier's life! The
   first part of David's life he spent as a captain of free-booters. That
   word does not quite describe his band, for they were not lawless
   robbers, but they were men, we are told, who were discontented and who
   fled from regular government--and we know from their character and
   conduct that they were rough, unbridled soldiers who would never have
   been governed by anyone less strong in character than David. Now
   associations like these he must often have felt to be extremely
   dangerous to his spirit.

   Notice, then, what this practical Christian used as his remedy. It was
   prayer--prayer with an earnest cry. He felt as if he were slipping and
   he cried, "Lord, grasp me, hold me! Arrest the sliding of these feet."
   It was a cry such as a child uses when it is lost, and it cries for its
   mother--a piteous cry of sorrow, of fear, of alarm. "My God, my
   Father," he seems to say, "I beseech You interpose. I slide. I fall.
   The precipice is beneath me--the ungodly seek to thrust me over
   it--come to my rescue, my God! Make haste and come to my rescue now."

   Now, if David used prayer, I will confirm that by reminding you of
   David's Master. When the Lord Jesus Christ was here upon earth he had
   many temptations to sin. His heart was not like yours and mine, a
   tinderbox to catch every spark of temptation but yet even He could not
   live here without much prayer. I say not that He could have sinned, but
   I do say that His holy Nature seemed instinctively to understand that
   it must use prayer, that it must use muchprayer in order to constantly
   cast off the temptations of the world! Cold mountains, therefore, and
   the midnight air continually witnessed to the intercessions and
   pleadings of Christ when He held communion with His God.

   I shall not need, I think, to spend even a moment in making the
   personal application, and yet I will do so, after all, on second
   thought. If there is a working man here who is called to work with many
   men who are drunks and blasphemers, let him take this word of advice
   tonight--pray twice as much as if you worked with the godly! If there
   is a young woman here placed in peculiar circumstances of temptation,
   let me say--keep up your communion with God with greater earnestness
   than if you were living at home with Christian parents! Pray more! Pray
   more intently! Live nearer to God in communion. When a man is sick of
   some disease that takes away his strength, the physician urges him to
   take a more liberal diet. So with you. Live better, now that there are
   greater drains upon your spiritual constitution--if you do not do so
   you will be sorely sick, but if you maintain this, you will be kept
   above the evil.

   But I need your attention, in closing, to the last thought suggested by
   the text. The objective of David's prayer was that he might hear the
   voice of God in his soul, "lest," says he, "if You are silent to me, I
   become like those who go down to the pit."

   IV. WHAT, THEN, WAS THIS VOICE OF GOD WHICH DAVID DESIRED TO HEAR?

   Let me guess at it for a minute. Was it not, first, that voice which
   would awaken sacred memories You have been exposed to temptation, my
   Brothers and Sisters, and you are ready to yield, but a voice reminds
   you of the day of your first espousals when your heart was warm towards
   Christ--of the days of your Baptism, when you were buried with Christ,
   professing to be dead to the world! It reminds you of the solemn vows
   that you made in years gone by, of solemn declarations that were
   registered before high Heaven that you would be firm and faithful, and
   keep Covenant with God. What? Will you, you, you--will you sin? A
   member of a Christian Church, one whose head has been leaning on
   Christ's bosom, one who has heard His voice and rejoiced in it--can
   you, can you turn aside? Perhaps you have an invitation for
   tomorrow--can you accept it when it involves sin? It may be that this
   very night you would have fallen, but by the recollection of those holy
   and happy seasons that you have had at the Lord's Table, those times of
   private payer, those hours when it was well with you, and you did walk
   with God, the still small voice of God calls to you, "What are you
   doing here, Elijah? Servant of God, what have you to do in the way of
   Assyria, to drink the waters of the muddy river? Turn aside from the
   ways of sin and seek your God."

   That voice would do something more, however, than startle the
   recollections of memory--it was intended to infuse vigor and courage.
   Sometimes a captain's voice has been known to win a battle, when the
   ranks are beginning to waver, when the pikes of the enemy are pushing
   forward. Here he comes--the gallant captain, always first in every
   charge. "'Tis he! 'Tis he!" they say, and he comes to the front and
   cries, "Will you flee before them? Will you play the coward?
   Standard-bearer, unfurl the banner and advance!" And at that word, so
   full of fire, and force, and energy, the enemy is made to quail, and on
   they dash and the victory is won! My God, let me hear Your voice within
   my soul just after that sort. When I shall begin to run before my
   spiritual foes, when association with them has almost overthrown me,
   let me hear the voice of Him who endured such contradiction of sinners
   against Himself--and my Leader's voice, as it calls me on, shall
   re-animate my spirit that I may win the day!

   The voice of God, moreover, may be regarded as that which actually
   impels the soul. "Let there be light," said God, and light flitted
   through the darkness. God's voice creates, upholds, strengthens,
   perfects! And when God's voice comes into the heart of a sinking
   Christian, when that Christian thinks, "It is no use standing out any
   longer. I may as well give it up and become as others are"--then if
   that voice comes, it speaks to the heart and it throbs healthily! It
   speaks to the judgment, and it puts no longer bitter for sweet! It
   speaks to the will, and the will becomes firm for the right and for the
   truth! God's voice, that breaks the rocks and splits the cedars of
   Lebanon, inspirits and encourages the heart of the Believer! Put up
   your prayer, then, tonight, you that are much tried and tempted, "Lord,
   let me hear Your voice! Let me hear it every morning before I go into
   the world." Beloved, never look man in the face till you have seen the
   face of God! Oh, lock up your hearts every morning by prayer and give
   God the key, so that no evil may get in while you are out of doors. Oh,
   you do not know how some members of this Church grieve us by their
   inconsistency! I would sooner bury you than that you should sin so as
   to grieve God's Spirit and cause the enemy to blaspheme. The Lord has
   kept many, many of you with garments white and unspotted, but if you
   want our hearts to break, profess to be Christians, and then go into
   sin!

   May the Lord keep you, my Beloved, keep you fast and firm amidst this
   crooked and perverse generation! You young people, you young men and
   women--may the Lord grant that none of you may ever turn your backs in
   the day of battle! And you old people--the greatest pain we have ever
   had has been brought to this Church not by young people, but by old
   people! It is the old fools that are the biggest fools when they are
   fools! When old people are wise, they are the wisest--but when they are
   foolish, they are the most foolish! God keep the aged, and preserve
   their reverend heads, that they may not disgrace them, but may be a
   crown of glory to them! The Lord keep the pastors, keep the Elders, be
   with you all, and keep you all pure and unspotted from the world! This
   is our prayer and desire. God grant it, for Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: DANIEL 6.

   Verses 1-3. It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and
   twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom. And over these
   three governors, of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give
   accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage. Then this
   Daniel was preferred above the governors and princes, because an

   excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the
   whole realm. Kings are never satisfied. The empire of Darius was always
   growing--and a Chapter or two farther on we find that he had 127
   provinces. There is no end to the greediness of man, and what does he
   get by it, after all? One pair of hands can only do one man's work! He
   only gains more toils and he has now to distribute the cares of his
   State among others. Then how good it is for any man when he is guided
   to a right, honest and hearty helper! Such was the lot of Darius. How
   advantageous, too, it may be for the people of God when a man like
   Daniel is put in the high places of the land! Doubtless he was exalted,
   not only for his own sake, but that he might be as a bronze shield and
   bulwark for the people of God in that foreign land. No extortions would
   now be committed on the Jewish race, for they had a friend at court.
   Blessed be God, we have a Friend at court, too, One who will take up
   our cause and speak for us to the King of Kings!

   4. Then the governors and princes sought to find occasion against
   Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find no occasion nor
   fault.Who can stand before envy? High places furnish very uncomfortable
   seats, for even if God exalt a man, men will try to pull him down! But
   he is an honorable man, indeed, who puts his enemies to their shifts
   before they can find anything against him.

   4-7. Forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault
   found in him. Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion
   against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the Law
   of his God. Then these governors andprinces assembled together to the
   king, andsaid thus unto him, King Darius live forever! All the
   governors of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the
   counselors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a
   royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask
   apetition ofany God or man for thirty days, save ofyou,

   King, he shall be cast into the den of lions.We do not know with what
   ingenious arguments they moved the king's mind to pass this, but we
   think we can conceive them. He had just conquered Chaldea--they would,
   therefore, say, "It will be an excellent test of the obedience of your
   new subjects if you touch them upon the point of their religion--try
   whether they will, for 30 days abstain from addressing their deities."
   Perhaps, too, since Darius had a colleague on the throne, the younger
   Cyrus, who was much more popular than he, they may have egged him on by
   hinting that Cyrus was much too vain and that, therefore, if he would
   not allow anyone to address a petition, even to Cyrus, for 30 days, it
   would tend to show who was really loyal to Darius and would also test
   the temper of Cyrus. I cannot tell how they did it, but somehow or
   other they managed to lead the foolish old man to carry out their
   designs.

   8. Now, O King, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be
   not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which
   alters not.The Babylonians entrusted their king with absolute power.
   Hence he could will this or that as he chose. The Persians believed
   their kings to be possessed of perfect wisdom--hence they never allowed
   a law to be changed, for that would be to suppose that the king who
   made it had made a mistake--a thing which could by no possibility ever
   occur. There is an amusing instance given by a modern traveler, who
   tells us that a few years ago one of the later Persian kings said he
   would never leave his tent in the plains until the snow had gone from
   some mountains to which he pointed. It happened to be a very late
   summer and the snow was long in melting--and his gracious majesty had
   to keep his place in his tent, while his troops were perishing with
   fever in a low marsh district, until they procured men to sweep the
   snow from the tops of the mountains in order that he might be able to
   move. It is inconvenient for men to play God--they cannot do it without
   bringing serious difficulty and danger upon themselves. So did Darius
   on this occasion.

   1 never like men who, when they speak a hasty word, say they cannot
   change it. Rash vows are better broken than kept. You had no right to
   say you would do the thing, much less have you any right to do it when
   you have said you would do it. However, the law of the Medes and
   Persians could not be altered.

   9. 10. Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree. Now
   when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his
   house.That is right. The less we have to do with man, and the more we
   have to do with God, the better. He did not go to the king to complain,
   but he went into his house to tell his God about it!

   10. And his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem--That
   much-loved city, though now in ruins. 10. He kneeled upon his knees
   three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he
   did before. 'Twas

   bravely done. A man in a meaner position might have carried out his
   devotions in private without sin, but not so Daniel. He is a
   representative man--he must not play the coward--it is incumbent upon
   him to be more especially and deliberately public in all that he does,
   for if he is seen to slink in ever so small a degree, then all the
   saints will lose heart.

   11-13. Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making
   supplication before his God. Then they came near, and spoke before the
   king concerning the king's decree: Have you not signed a decree, that
   every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty
   days, save of you, O King, shall be cast into the den of lions? The

   king answered andsaidd, Thee thing is true. According to thee law of
   thee Mede and Persians, which alters not. Then answered they and said
   before the king, That Daniel--Here is impudence! But they called Jesus
   Christ, "this Fellow." Why, Daniel was the chief of the governors, the
   prime minister of the king, and yet they said, "That Daniel." Evil
   hearts generally have evil mouths, and what can you expect but evil
   words out of evil mouths?

   13. That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah.
   That captive, that slave, that serf--so they seemed to put it,
   forgetting that he was their master by virtue of his high office.

   13-14. Regards notyou, O King, nor the decree that you havesigned, but
   makes hispetition three times a day. Then the king, when he heard these
   words, was sorely displeased with himself There was a little conscience
   left. Calvin did not like the man at all. He said, "What right had he
   to hastily sign a decree which might take away the lives of the best
   men in his dominion? And his repentance does not seem to be a
   repentance of the act, but only of the consequences."

   14. And set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labored till the
   going down of the sun to deliver him. Here was a great king, made
   himself out to be a god, and yet he cannot have his own way! When that
   famous potter, who was a true Christian, was brought before the king,
   the king said to him, "Unless you change your views, I shall be
   compelled to have you burned." "Ah," said Bernard de Palissy, "you are
   a king and yet say, 'I shall be compelled,' and I am a poor potter, but
   no man can make me use those words--I will be compelled to do nothing
   against my conscience.'" Oh, the holy bravery of men who are saved!
   When Bonner had one of the martyrs before him, he said, "I will
   convince you! Blazing wood will convince you!" "A fig for your wood,"
   said the man, "or a wagon-load of them. I can stand and burn better
   than you can wear your miter." So the saints of God are strong and can
   bid defiance to the adversary through Divine Grace.

   15. Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king,
   Know, O King, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, that no decree
   nor statute which the king establishes may be changed. This is the
   reason of his deliverance, not his innocence, but his faith--we are
   told by Paul that it was faith that shut the mouths of lions.

   16-24. Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him
   into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Your
   God, whom you serve continually, He wiil deliver you. And a stone was
   brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it
   with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose
   might not be changed concerning Daniel Then the king went to his
   palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music
   brought before him: and his sleep went from him. Then the king arose
   very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. And
   when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel:
   and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living
   God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from
   the lions? Then saidDaniel unto the king, O King, live forever! My God
   has sent His angel, and has shut the lions' months, that they have not
   hurt me: forasmuch as before Him innocence was found in me; and also
   before you, O King, have I done no hurt. Then was the king exceedingly
   glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the
   den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was
   found upon him, because he believed in his God. And the king commanded,
   and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them
   into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives. Which was
   a piece of injustice, the throwing in of their wives and children,
   though we cannot say as much of the throwing of them in.

   24. And the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in
   pieces before they ever came to the bottom of the den.

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "One thing is necessary." Luke 10:44.

   "One thing I know." John 9:25. "One thing I do." Philippians 3:13.

   [The original title of this sermon was A THREEFOLD MOTTO.]

   I HAVE "one thing" in view--"one thing" on which I want to rivet your
   attention. Forbear with me if I detain you a few minutes before
   announcing a text. It has been said that a man of one book is terrible
   in the force of his convictions. He has studied it so well, digested it
   so thoroughly and understands it so profoundly, that it is perilous to
   encounter him in controversy. No man becomes eminent in any pursuit
   unless he gives himself up to it with all the powers and passions of
   his nature--body and soul. Michelangelo had never been so great a
   painter if his love of art had not become so enthusiastic that he
   frequently did not take off his garments to sleep by the week
   together--nor had Handel ever been such a great musician if his ardor
   for celestial sounds had not led him to use the keys of his harpsichord
   till, by constant fingering, they became the shape of spoons. A man
   must have one pursuit and consecrate all his powers to one purpose if
   he would excel or rise to eminence among his fellows.

   When streams of water divide themselves into innumerable streams, they
   usually create a swamp which proves dangerous to the inhabitants of the
   neighborhood. Could all those streams be dammed up into one channel,
   and made to flow in one direction, they might resolve themselves into a
   navigable river, bearing commerce to the ocean and enriching the people
   who dwelt upon its banks. To obtain one thing, one comprehensive
   blessing from Heaven, has been the objective of many a saintly prayer,
   like that of David, "Unite my heart to fear Your name." The advice of
   Paul was, "Set not your affection upon things on earth," not, "your
   affections," as it is often misquoted. The Apostle would have all the
   affections tied up into one affection--and that one concentrated
   affection not set upon earthly things--but upon things above, where
   Christ sits at the right hand of God! The concurrence of all our powers
   and capacities with one single impulse, to obtain one objective and to
   produce one result, is one great aim of the Gospel of Jesus Christ!

   The "one thing" concerning which I am now about to talk very seriously
   to you will require three texts to elucidate it. There are three pithy
   passages of Holy Scripture which I shall endeavor to press home on your
   heart and conscience.

   I. ONE THING NECESSARY.

   Our first text is to be found in the Gospel according to Luke 10:44,
   "One thing is necessary." This one thing, according to this passage, is
   faith in Christ Jesus, the sitting down at the Master's feet, the
   drinking in of His Word. If I may expand for a minute the "one thing,"
   without seeming to make 20 things of that which is but one, I will
   refer it to the possession of a new life. This life is given to us
   when, by the power of the Holy Spirit, we are created anew in Christ
   Jesus. And it develops itself in a simple confidence in Jesus, in a
   hearty obedience to Jesus, in a desire to be like Jesus and in a
   constant yearning to be near to Jesus. "One thing is necessary"--that
   one thing is salvation--worked in us by the Holy Spirit, through faith
   which is in Jesus Christ our Lord. The new heart, the right spirit, a
   filial fear of God, love to Jesus--this is the "one thing necessary."
   How I trust you all know how to distinguish things essential from
   things convenient, and that you are more concerned about necessary
   things than about things merely attractive, or, at most, but an
   accessory to your welfare! The little child may admire the field which
   is covered with red and blue flowers. The farmer cares nothing for
   these flowers--he delights in the wheat that is ripening for the
   sickle. So our childish minds are often fascinated with the flaunting
   flowers of fortune and fashion--craving after wealth, fame and worldly
   distinction--but our better reason, if it is allowed to speak, will
   prefer the necessary things, the things which we must have, or else
   must

   2 A Threefold Slogan Sermon #3536

   perish. We may do without earthly goods, for thousands have been happy
   in life and triumphant in death without any of the luxury which riches
   can purchase. The heart's love of his fellow creatures has been fairly
   won by many a humble man who never courted popular applause. The
   patience of the poor has often counted for fine gold, while the pride
   of the affluent has passed for nothing but foul dross. Even lack of
   health, Heaven's priceless blessing to mortals here below, has not
   hindered some precious sufferers from serving their generation,
   glorifying God in a martyrdom of pain and bequeathing treasures of
   piety to a grateful posterity. Ten thousand things are convenient.
   Thousands of things are desirable. Hundreds of things are to be sought
   for, but there is one thing, only one thing, the one thing we have
   described to you, of which our Savior speaks as the "one thing
   necessary."

   And, oh, how necessary it is! Necessary for your children--they are
   growing up about you and much joy they give you--for you can see in
   them many budding excellences. To your partial eyes they give promise
   of goodness, if not of greatness! They will be the comfort of your
   declining years. You have carefully watched their education. Not a whit
   of their moral habits have you failed to overlook. To give them a fair
   start in the world has been your fond desire till their portion is the
   fruit of your providence. From perils you would protect them. Lest they
   should have to rough it, perhaps, as much as their father before them,
   you would pilot them through the straits. Good! But, dear parents, do
   remember that "one thing is necessary" for your children, that they may
   commence life, continue in life and close life honorably. It is well
   that they should be educated. It is well that morality should be
   instilled into them, but this is not enough! Alas, we have seen many
   leave the purest parental influences to plunge into the foulest sins!
   Their education has become but a tool for iniquity, and the money with
   which they might have helped themselves to competence has been
   squandered away in vice. "One thing is necessary" for that bright-eyed
   boy! Oh, if you can take him to the Savior, and if the blessing of the
   Good Shepherd shall alight upon him and renew him while yet a child,
   the best will have been done for him--yes, his one chief need supplied!
   And if that dear girl, before she comes to womanhood, shall have been
   led to that blessed Savior who rejects none that come to Him, she will
   have received all she shall need for time and for eternity! Quicken
   your prayers, then, dear parents. Think of your children, to seek their
   welfare more intelligently. Be more importunate in intercession on
   their behalf! Truly, this is the one thing necessary for them.

   One thing, too, is necessary for that young man just leaving home to go
   out as an apprentice and learn his trade. That is a trying time for an
   untried hand. The heart may well flutter as one, young and
   inexperienced, reflects that he is now about to sail, not on a coasting
   voyage, but to put fairly out to sea. Before long it will be seen
   whether those fair professions had the Truths of God as a foundation.
   He will get to London--many of you have passed through this ordeal! The
   Metropolis, what a maze it seemed to you at first, and with what
   amazement you surveyed it! What with propensities within your breast,
   and profuse attractions outside--temptation held you spell-bound! What
   could not be done in the village--what you dared not thinkof in the
   little market town, seems easy to be done unobserved in the great city!
   Hundreds of fingers point you to the haunts of pleasure, the home of
   vice, the path to Hell! Ah, mother and father, you present the Bible as
   your parting gift. You write the youth's name on the flyleaf. You offer
   your prayers and you shed your tears for him. Steals there not over you
   the conviction that the one thing he needs you cannot pack in his
   trunk, nor can you send it up to him by a post office order? The one
   thing necessary is that Christ should be formed in his heart the hope
   of glory! With that he would begin life well. A sword of the true
   Jerusalem metal, that will not break in the heat of the conflict, will
   be serviceable all his journey through. Do I address some young man who
   has not forgotten his mother's kind remarks when he left home? Let me
   just echo them, and say to him, One thing you lack! Oh, seek it, seek
   it now! Before going out of this house, seek till, through Grace, you
   obtain this one thing necessary which shall bear you safely to the
   skies!

   But "one thing is necessary," not merely for those youngsters at home,
   or for those about to go abroad in the world. One thing is necessary
   for the businessman. "Ah," he says, "I need a great many things." But
   what, I ask, is the one thing? You speak of "the necessary." You call
   ready cash "the indispensable." "Give me this," says the man of the
   world, "and I don't care about anything else! Recommend your religion
   to whom you please, but let me have solid gold and silver, and I will
   be well content." Ah, Sirs, you delude yourselves with phantoms! You
   fondly dream that wealth in your hands would count for more than it has
   ever done for your fellows. You must have seen some men make large
   fortunes whom you knew to be very miserable. They have retired from
   business to get a little rest, and yet they could find no rest in their
   retirement! You must have known others who, the more they got, the more
   they have wanted, for they have swal-

   lowed a horseleech, and it has cried, "Give, give!" Of course, you
   never suspected that the money did the mischief, or that the precious
   metal poisoned the heart. But are you in quest of happiness? It lies
   not in investments, whether in government bonds or mortgages, or stocks
   or debentures, or gold or silver. These properties are profitable. They
   can be used to promote happiness. As accessories to our welfare, they
   may often prove to be blessings, but if accredited with intrinsic worth
   they will eat as does a canker! Money circulated is a medium of public
   benefit, while money hoarded is a means of private discomfort! A man is
   but a muckraker who is forever seeking to scrape everything to himself.
   A miser is bound to be miserable. Before high Heaven, he is an object
   to make the angels weep! One thing is necessary for you merchants,
   brokers and warehousemen to keep you from sinking under your anxieties
   and losses, or to preserve you from becoming sordid and selfish through
   your successes and lest your greed should increase with your gains! One
   thing is necessary that your life may be a true life, or else, when it
   comes to its end, all that can be said of you will amount to this, "He
   died worth so much." Must that be your only memorial? When you depart
   from this world, the poor and needy will not miss you. Widow and
   orphans will not grieve for you! The Church militant will not mourn!
   The bright spirits above will not be waiting to greet you. The grand
   climax of your career--a will! A testament sworn under a very large
   sum! What shall it profit any man what fortune he may have amassed, if
   he loses his soul?

   Do you think that riches possessed in this world will procure any
   respect in the nether regions? I have heard that in the old Fleet
   Prison, the thief who was put into jail for stealing ten thousand
   pounds thought himself a gentleman in comparison with those common
   fellows who were put in for some paltry debt of 20 or 25 pounds! There
   are no such distinctions in Hell! You who can boast your talents of
   gold and talents of silver, if cast away, shall be as complete wrecks
   as those who never had copper or sliver, but lived and died in
   privation and poverty! You need one thing, and if you get this one
   thing, your wealth shall prove a blessing--otherwise it will be a
   curse! With this one thing your sufficiency for the day guaranteed to
   you by promise shall make you as one of Heaven's favorites, fed by the
   hand of God, always needy, but never neglected. You aged folk--there
   are some such here--shall I have to remind any of you that one thing is
   necessary--yes, most necessary to you? Death has already put his bony
   palm upon your head and frozen your hair to the whiteness of that
   winter in which all your strength must fail, and all your beauty fade.
   Oh, if you have no Savior! You will soon have to quit these transitory
   scenes. The young may die, but the old must. To die without a Savior
   will be dreary and dreadful! Then, after death, the judgment! Brave old
   man, how will your courage stand that outlook, if you have none to
   plead your cause? Oh, aged woman, you will soon be in the scales--very
   soon must your character be weighed. If it is said of you, "Tekel, she
   is weighed in the balances and found wanting," there will be no
   opportunity to get right or adjust your relations to God or to your
   fellow creatures. Your lamp will have gone out. There will be no chance
   of rekindling it! If lost, forever lost--forever in the dark--forever
   cast away! Little enough will it avail you, then, that you have
   nourished and brought up children. It will not suffice you, then, that
   you paid your debts honestly. Vain the plea that you attended a place
   of worship and were always respected in the neighborhood! ONE THING is
   necessary! Lacking that, you will turn out to have been a fool!
   Notwithstanding many opportunities and repeated invitations, you have
   rejected the one thing--the one only thing--what an irreparable
   mistake! Oh, how you will weep as one disappointed! How you will gnash
   your teeth as do those who upbraid themselves! You will mourn forever,
   and your self-reproach shall know no end!

   I wish I could move you, as I desire, to feel as I feel, myself--that
   this one thing is necessary to every unconverted person here present.
   Some of you have already got this one choice thing that is so
   necessary. Hold it fast! Never let it go! Grace gave it to you--Divine
   Grace will keep it for you--Grace will hold you true to it. Never be
   ashamed of it. Prize it beyond all cost! But as for you who have it
   not--I think I hear your funeral knell pealing in my ears, and as you
   speed away, your spirits made to fly for very fear, right into the arms
   of Justice, I think I hear your bitter cry, "The harvest is past, the
   summer is ended and we are not saved!" I would gladly pluck you by the
   skirts, if I could, and say to you, "Why not seek the one thing
   necessary without more ado? Get it now! It will not in any way hurt
   you. It will make you happy, here, and blessed hereafter." It is as
   necessary for this life as for the next, as necessary for the exchange
   as for the sick chamber, as necessary for the street and for the shop
   as for the dying bed and for the Day of Judgment. One thing--one thing
   is necessary! And now allow me to stop before taking you a stage
   further. Allow me, as it were, to change horses. I must take another
   text--

   II. ONE THING KNOWN.

   It is in the Gospel according to John, the 9th Chapter, and the 25th
   verse, and these are the words, "One thing I know."

   The man who was born blind, whose eyes were opened at the pool of
   Siloam, said, "One thing I know." This simple statement I want to turn
   into a pointed question. Among the many things, dear Friends, that you
   are acquainted with, do you know the one thing that this poor man knew,
   "Whereas I was blind, now I see"? Here is a wealth of self-knowledge in
   this single avowal. Little enough, I daresay, he knew about other
   people, but he knew a great deal about himself He was well aware that
   he once was blind--and he was quite positive that he now could see. Oh,
   can you say it with sincerity, "I know that I was once blind--I could
   see no beauty in Christ, though I thought I saw great beauties in the
   world. Then I could not love God. I did not hate sin. I had no
   repentance, nor had I any faith. I was blind, but now-- oh, blessed
   change--now I see my sin and weep over it! Now I see a Savior, and I
   trust Him! Now I see His beauties and I admire Him! Now I see His
   service and I delight to spend my strength in it! One thing I know."
   What a marvelous experience of a marvelous change this implies! Nor can
   its importance be overrated. There is no going to Heaven unless you
   undergo a change which shall make you entirely new and make all things
   entirely new to you. A young convert once said, "I do not know what is
   happening--either the world is changed, or else I am, for nothing seems
   to me to be the same as once it was." Ah, this old Bible, what a dry
   Book it used to be, but, oh, how it abounds in marrow and fatness now!
   Prayer--what a tedious duty, once, but what a delightful exercise now!
   The going up to God's House on the Sabbath-- used it not to be a
   weariness of the flesh? How much better to be in the fields! Yet now,
   how delightful we feel, to assemble with the Lord's saints! With what
   pleasure we hail the festal morn! All things are altered. Behold, all
   things are become new! What we once hated, we love, and what we loved,
   we hate! Is it so, dear Hearer--is it so with you?

   Do not, I pray you, be content with mere reformation. Were you before a
   drunk, and are you now a teetotaler? Good--very good! Yet, good as it
   is, it will not save your soul! Dishonest and knavish you once were,
   but truthful and trustworthy you may now be--yet rely not upon it for
   salvation! In former days, unchaste--by stern resolve you may have
   given up the favorite lust--but even that will not save you! Those who
   never fell into your foul sloughs need the change, too. "You must be
   born-again." You must have an entire renewal--a radical change! It is
   not cutting off the limbs of a tree, nor shifting it to another place,
   that will convert a bramble into a vine. The sap must be changed. The
   heart must be renewed. The inner man must be made completely new. Is it
   so with you? Why, I think if some of us were to meet our old selves
   walking down the street, we would hardly know ourselves! 'Tis true, old
   self has taken good care to knock at our door pretty often since. Of
   all the knocks we hear, not even excepting that of the devil, there is
   none we dread so much! The knock of the old man when he says, "Let me
   in with my corruptions and lusts, and let me reign and have my own
   way." No, old man, you were once ourselves, but go your way, for we
   have put off the old man with his deeds, and put on the new man--we
   cannot know you, for one thing we know now that we knew not
   before--whereas we were blind, now we see!

   Need I linger any longer upon this point? Let it suffice if I leave it
   as a kind of awakening question upon the heart and conscience. There
   are not 20 things, but there is ONE THING you have to enquire about. Do
   you know for sure this one thing--that you are not now what you used to
   be? Do you know that Jesus has made the difference? That Jesus has
   opened the eyes that were once without sight? That you now see Jesus,
   and seeing, you love Him? Our third subject is-- III. ONE THING DONE.

   The text is in the 3rd Chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians, at
   the 13th verse. There the Apostle Paul says, "One thing I do."

   Pray observe that I did not introduce "doing" first. That would not be
   appropriate. We do not begin with doing. The one thing necessary is not
   doing. Coming to Christ and trusting Him, must take the lead. Not until
   after you have got the one thing necessary, and know that you have got
   it, and are conscious that, whereas you were blind, now you see, can
   you be fit to take the next step--"one thing I do." And what is that
   one thing? "Forgetting the things which are behind, and reaching forth
   unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the
   prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." It seems, then, that
   the Apostle gave his whole mind up to the glorifying of God by his
   spiritual life. He was never content with what he was. If he had a
   little faith, he sought for more. If he had a little hope, he aimed to
   obtain more. If he had some degree of virtue, he coveted more. Oh,
   Christians, never be satisfied with being merely saved! Up with you!
   Away! Off! Go onward to the high mountains, to the clearer light, to
   the brighter joy! If saved and

   brought, like the shipwrecked mariner, to shore--is that enough? Yes,
   for the moment it is enough to guarantee the purest satisfaction and
   the warmest congratulations. But the mariner must seek a livelihood as
   long as he lives. He must put forth his energies. Whatever avocations
   open up before him, he must vigorously seek such favors of fortune as
   may possibly be within his reach. Just so, let it be with you. Saved
   from the deep which threatened to swallow you up, rejoice that you are
   preserved from death, but resolve that the life vouchsafed to you shall
   be active, earnest, vigorous, fruitful in every good deed and work! Be
   diligent as your traders are! See how they wake their servants up in
   the morning, how they scold them if they are not diligent. This man
   must be hurried to one place, and that man to another. How sharp they
   speak! How quickly they move about! They will do their business and
   they spare no pains to increase it. Oh, that we were half as diligent
   in the service of God! Here we are driveling away our time. We do not
   put out all our talents, augment our faith, or enlarge our coast. Why
   are we so indolent in going to that great giver of every good and
   perfect gift for fresh supplies? Why do we not wait upon Him to be
   enriched? Would to God that we were as diligent in spiritual as we are
   in temporal things! Oh, that we were burning with a holy covetousness
   for the best gifts God can bestow and the choicest blessings saints can
   receive!

   Paul was anxious to do more good, to get more good, to be more good. He
   sought to win souls. He needed to make Christ's name known. An ardent
   passion inflamed him! A high enthusiasm inspired him. Tent-making, it
   is true, was his trade, but tent-making did not monopolize quite all
   his heart, and soul, and strength! Does your secular vocation absorb
   all your thoughts? Though Paul was proud of his industry, and could say
   conscientiously, "My own hands have ministered to my necessities," yet
   preaching was the one thing he pursued as his life-work. He was a
   workman, just as many of you are--but where were his tools? They were
   ready to hand when he needed them. And did they, do you think, ever
   creep up into his heart? I believe never. "For us to live," said he,
   "is Christ." That was as true, I will guarantee you, when he was
   tent-making, or picking up sticks on the island of Malta, as when he
   was talking heavenly wisdom to the worldly-wise, addressing the
   Athenians on Mars' Hill or when he discoursed touching the resurrection
   of the dead to the Jews, or when he expounded the way of justification
   to the Gentiles! He was a man of one idea, and that one idea had
   entirely possessed him! In the old pictures they put a halo around the
   head of the saints. But, in fact, that halo encircles their hearts and
   penetrates every member of their bodies. The halo of disinterested
   consecration to Christ should not be about their brows, alone, to adorn
   their portraits, for it encompassed their entire being, their spirit,
   soul and body! It environed them, their whole being. "This one thing I
   do," was the slogan of early saints. Let it be your slogan!

   Beloved, I address you as the saints of this generation. My earnest
   desire is that you should not come behind in Grace or in gifts. When
   the Believers of all ages muster, and are marshaled, may you be found
   among the faithful and true. If not among the first or second class of
   worthies in the army of the Son of David, yet good soldiers of Jesus
   Christ! Our God is a loving Father. He likes to praise His people. To
   this end do be clear about the one thing you need, the one thing you
   know, and the one thing you do! So will you stand well in that day.
   Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: JOHN9.

   Verses l-3. Andas Jesuspassed by He saw a man who was blind from his
   birth. And His disciples askedHim, saying, Master, who did sin, this
   man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither
   has this man sinned, nor his parents, but that the works of God should
   be made manifest in him. We are not to look upon such afflictions as
   any indication of special sin on the part either of the person or the
   parent. Of course, sin lies at the root of all our suffering as a great
   generic fact, but not so that we may attribute such an affliction to
   any one sin. The disciples, you see, dear Friends, are thinking about
   difficult problems. Their Master is thinking about how, practically, to
   meet the difficulty, and to this day there are a large number of
   Christians, professors and even ministers who occupy their time about
   questions which really are to no profit. If they could be answered,
   nobody would be the holier or the better! What does it matter to us
   what is the origin of evil? Far more important to turn the evil out
   than it is to find out how it came in! Very frequently, you know, after
   there is a terrible calamity or accident, we have an inquiry as to how
   it was done, and then we think the thing is all attended to. It would
   have been better, perhaps, to have an inquiry, before it was done, as
   to how it could be prevented. Our Lord has that wisdom--that
   practicalness. He begins to deal with the evil rather than to raise

   questions about it. Yes, and He sees in that evil a good coming out of
   it! He says that this man was blind, that the works of God might be
   made manifest in him.

   4-7. Imust work the works ofHim who sent Me while it is day: the night
   comes, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the
   light of the world. When He had thus spoken, He spat on the ground and
   made clay of the spittle, and He anointed the eyes of the blind man
   with the clay. And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,
   (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went his way therefore, and
   washed, and came seeing. Our Lord used instrumentality. It did not
   appear, however, to be very likely to achieve His purpose. The clay
   seemed more likely to blind than to give sight, yet if the Lord chooses
   to use the poor and weak instruments that seem nothing better than dust
   and spittle, He has the glory of the grand result! If He takes the
   humble ministry of His servants and uses it in the pulpit, or in the
   Sunday school, or anywhere else, He has all the more Glory and is the
   less likely to be robbed of it because He uses such unlikely means.

   8, 9. The neighbors therefore, and they who before had seen him that he
   was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, This is
   he--We are sure of it.

   9. Others said, He is like he--They were cautious bodies.

   9. But he said, I am he. He knew there was no mistaking his witness!

   10, 11. Therefore said they unto him, How were your eyes opened? He
   answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed
   my eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I
   went and washed, and I received sight.Very straightforward, very
   concise, very accurate--and when we make answer about our conversion,
   it is always well to take this for a copy--not too many flourishes, no
   coloring. He even leaves out about the spittle, but he gives it all as
   he can recollect it. So when you are talking about the Lord's love to
   you and His way of converting you, it is quite sufficiently remarkable,
   without any touch of rouge. Let it be given just as it is.

   12. Then said they unto him, Where is He? He said I do not know. Enough
   for him to know what he did know-- that his eyes were opened and how it
   was done! So sometimes I have known persons come upon the new convert
   with a question which has rather baffled him, and he has been troubled
   because he could not answer it. Do not let it trouble you! You are not
   expected to know everything. The very best and most honest thing is to
   say, "I do not know"

   13-14. They brought to the Pharisees him that before was blind. And it
   was the Sabbath Day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.So
   you may be sure that the Pharisees would be down upon Him for that,
   because, according to the Rabbis, the making of the clay to put upon
   this man's eyes would be a kind of brick-making--and they would bring
   Him in guilty of brick-making directly! So did these men pervert things
   and make men guilty where no offense had been committed whatever.

   15. Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his
   sight He said unto them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do
   see. He is shorter with them. Some tales grow in telling. His gets
   shorter. Besides, he has to deal with captious people--and then the
   least said, the sooner mended--and this shrewd man thought so.

   16, 17. Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This Man is not of God,
   because He keeps not the Sabbath. Others said, How can a man that is a
   sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. They said
   unto the blind man, again, What say you ofHim, that He has opened your
   eyes? He said, He is a Prophet He could see that.

   18-24. But the Jews didnot believe concerning him, that he had been
   blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him
   that had received his sight. And they asked them, saying, Is this your
   son, who you say was born blind? How, then, does he now see? His
   parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that
   he was born blind. But by what means he now sees, we know not; he is of
   age; ask him. He shall speak for himself. These words spoke his parents
   because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already that if
   any man did confess that he was the Christ, he would be put out of the
   synagogue. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. Then
   again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God
   the praise: we know that this Man is a sinner How piously these
   Pharisees can talk--and generally in the name of God, all sorts of
   mischief begins. When men are persecuting the Son of God, yet still
   they take the name of God upon their lips. Did they not burn the
   martyrs to the glory of God? Oh, yes, and so did these men thus slander
   Christ by saying, "We know that this Man is a sinner," and yet they
   spoke about giving God praise!

   25. He Our shrewd friend of the opened eyes.

   25-27. Answered and said, Whether He is a sinner or not, I know not:
   one thing Iknow, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. Then said they
   to him again, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes? He
   answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear: therefore
   would you hear it again? Will you also be His disciples?The man is
   sharp, acute, cutting.

   28, 29. Then they reviledhim andsaid, You are His disciple; but we are
   Moses'disciples. We know that Godspoke unto Moses: as for this Fellow,
   we know not from where He comes. The word, "fellow," is supplied by the
   translators. There is no such word there because they did not know a
   word bad enough with which to express their scorn.

   30-33. The man answered andsaid unto them, Why herein is a marvelous
   thing, that you know not from where He comes and yet He has opened my
   eyes. Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man is a
   worshipper of God, and does His will, him He hears. Since the world
   began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was
   born blind. If this Man were not of God, He could do nothing. He
   proves! He administrates! The thing is as clear as possible, and yet
   they refuse to see it.

   34. They answered and said unto him, You were altogether born in sins.
   It is the old rule, "Abuse the plaintiff." Nothing could be said. Now
   abuse the man! He has answered you and his arguments are too difficult
   for you. Now throw hard words at him. "You were altogether born in
   sins."

   34. And do you teach us?Wonderful, that, "us." "Do you teach us?"
   Folly, ignorance and pride go together. This man, in the simplest and
   most unaffected manner, had told his tale and urged his argument--and
   now they abuse him and exalt themselves. "Do you teach us?" No, great
   Pharisees, he does not teach you, for you will not learn!

   34. And they cast him out. That is the last argument. Out with him! Now
   we have defeated him.

   35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when He had found him.
   What a blessed thing to be cast out, if Christ finds us! Many and many
   have been put out of the synagogue and treated with contempt, but then
   outside Jerusalem they found their Lord, for there He died outside the
   camp, and His people need not be ashamed to go after Him bearing His
   reproach. "When He had found him."

   35-38. He said unto him, Do you believe in the Son of God?He answered
   andsaid, Who is He, Lord, that Imight believe in Him? And Jesus said
   unto him, You have both seen Him, and it is He who is talking with you.
   And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped Him. He does not appear
   to have been a Unitarian, therefore, and if those persons had their
   eyes opened, they would do the same. "He said, Lord, I believe. And he
   worshipped Him."

   39. And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
   which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
   Christ is the turner of the tables. Did not the virgin mother sing, "He
   has put down the mighty from their seats, and He has exalted them of
   low degree. He has filled the hungry with good things, but the rich He
   has sent away empty"? So He always does.

   40. Jesus said unto them, If you were blind--Really could not see.

   41. You would have no sin If you really did not know better, were
   totally and altogether without knowledge--then you would have no sin
   compared with what you now have.

   41. But now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains. You
   acknowledge that you have sinned with your eyes open and, therefore,
   your sin is all the greater.

A Definite Challenge for Definite Prayer

   (No. 3537)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "And Jesus answered and said unto him, What do you want Me to do for
   you?" Mark 10:51.

   No doubt our Lord's disciples imagined that He was going up to
   Jerusalem to take unto Himself the Kingdom. They hoped that they would
   be partakers of that earthly grandeur which they had fondly pictured
   would glitter around the Person of the Son of David. When, therefore,
   the blind man ventured to cry out clamorously to Him, whom they
   esteemed to be a great King, they thought it a daring intrusion. Who
   was the son of Timaeus that he should say, "You Son of David, have
   mercy on me"? They were all anxious to hush the voice of misery in the
   Presence of so much Majesty. But our Lord Jesus Christ did not spurn
   the blind man's prayer as intrusive or impertinent. He was not angry
   with him. He did not even pass on without taking any notice. What He
   did was to stand still and command the man to be brought to

   Him.

   May we not draw some comfort from the thought that our prayers never
   are intrusions? Whenever we go before God in deep distress, He is
   always ready to listen to our cry. Whatever grand purpose or momentous
   project engage His mind, He will surely be attentive to the longings of
   His needy suppliants. Though our Lord Jesus Christ is at this moment
   King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and inconceivably glorious, though
   hosts of angels count it their highest delight to do His bidding, yet
   He bears in Heaven the same heart towards sinners which He had on
   earth! Amidst the thunders of the everlasting hallelujahs, He can
   detect the sighs of the prisoners, the complaints of the sufferers and
   the groans of the contrite. He will stop to give heed to the requests
   of blind beggars and, in His pity, He will relieve their distress.
   Should not this encourage those of you who are seeking Him? Whatever
   Satan may suggest to the contrary, take this passage of God's Word for
   cheer! He did hear the blind man's cry when He was upon earth and He
   will hear you, now that He is in Heaven! And you, backsliding child of
   God, difficult as you may find it to pray, if enabled to vent your
   griefs, your sighs shall be heard, your tears shall be seen and you
   shall certainly have an audience from Him who delights in mercy! There
   are times even with those who live nearest to God, when they fall into
   despondencies and imagine that their voice is shut out from Heaven's
   gate, but it is not so! When I cannot come to God as a saint, what a
   mercy it is that I may come to Him as a sinner! And if I have lost all
   my evidences, what a blessing it is that I need not stop to find them,
   that I may go to the Mercy Seat without any!--

   "Just as I am without one plea, But that His blood was shed for me."

   When reduced to the utmost beggary as to internal Grace. When I find
   myself naked, and poor, and miserable, I may still hear God saying to
   me, "I counsel you to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, and white
   raiment that you may be clothed." In our worst estate, prayer is still
   efficacious! Long as we live, let us pray. Until you hear the bolts of
   damnation fast closed upon you, and you are shut up in Hell, doubt not
   the right of petition, or the prevalence of your earnest plea! There is
   an ear to hear in Heaven as long as there is a heart to plead on earth.

   Let this first impression be riveted on your minds and you will, I
   trust, be prepared for three further reflections which I now wish to
   introduce to you. Our Lord, before He healed the blind man, said to
   Him, "What do you want Me to do for you?" Hence I infer that--

   I. IT IS IMPORTANT A SEEKING SINNER SHOULD KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT HE
   REALLY WANTS. AND SOMETIMES CHRIST DELAYS TO GIVE SALVATION UNTIL MEN
   ARE BROUGHT MORE CLEARLY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS COMPREHENDED IN THAT
   INESTIMABLE BLESSING.

   A large proportion of those persons who express a certain desire to be
   saved have no Scriptural idea whatever of what being saved is! I am
   afraid that many who profess to have found salvation are really the
   victims of religious excitement, greatly moved by the exhortations they
   have heard, yet in little or no degree enlightened as to the
   fundamental Truths of God on which a good hope is based.

   The most current idea, of course, is that to be saved means to be
   delivered from going down into the pit of Hell, from enduring the
   sentence of everlasting damnation. That it does comprise that, we grant
   you, though that is far from being its sole intent. This is a result of
   salvation, though it is not the essence of salvation as it is
   discovered to the souls of the redeemed. Men are saved, blessed be God,
   many years before the time of death--and conscious of being saved, too.
   In some respects they are as thoroughly and perfectly saved as they
   will be when they get to Heaven. Salvation is not postponed till the
   Day of Judgment, when you shall have deliverance from Hell--it may be
   enjoyed here on earth when your sins are forgiven and you are redeemed
   from the present evil world.

   Or it may be that you have a vague impression that salvation consists
   in the pardon of your sins. This is true, but it does not compass all
   the truth. When you say, "I would have my sins forgiven," do you know
   what sin is? Have you ever had any clear view of what it really means?
   We often use certain terms and common words, I fear, without a
   corresponding thought in our minds. Know, then, that you have broken
   God's Law, both by omitting to do what you should have done, and by
   doing that which you should not have done. Those Ten Commands which you
   will find in the 20th Chapter of Exodus are like so many mirrors in
   which you can see what you have done, and what you have not done--what
   crimes they are which cry out against you before the Judgment Throne of
   God, which will certainly drag you down to Hell unless you are
   delivered from the dread penalty. Consider, too, the heavy weight, as
   well as the grievous guilt, of sin. Have you felt the load and burden
   of sin? "A stone is heavy and the sand weighty," says Solomon. But, ah,
   what specific gravity will compare with sin! Well might David groan
   beneath the load, "My iniquities are gone over my head. As a heavy
   burden, they are too heavy for me."

   All the burdens that may devolve upon you through the toils of life,
   the calamities of the world, or the visitations of Providence, cannot
   equal the load of sin--for this is a burden that oppresses the
   conscience, crushes the heart and paralyzes every faculty of the soul.
   "The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity, but a wounded spirit,
   who can bear?" A conscience stricken with a sense of sin will readily
   interpret that wounded spirit which is not bearable for a man. Were
   that terrible incubus to rest long upon him, his spirit would fail
   utterly before the Lord! If mercy did not come speedily to their
   rescue, men might soon lose their wits and become frantic, despondency
   leading to despair--and despair to insanity. Oh, how venomous the
   poison of sin, when the arrows stick fast and fester! Have you known
   what sin is? If not, I am afraid your prayer will be unmeaning as that
   of James and John, to whom it was said, "You know not what you ask."
   Have you ever had an idea, when asking for the forgiveness of sin, what
   sin really deserves? What kind of recompense it justly demands? Let it
   always be remembered by us that every sin we have committed exposes us
   to the wrath of God--a wrath that is represented by terrible pictures
   in God's Word--as a flame that is never quenched, a fire that never
   ceases to burn. In order to deliver us from this penalty, it was
   absolutely necessary that Someone else should bear this punishment on
   our behalf. I do not think that we intelligently ask for the pardon of
   sin unless we have some view of the Crucified Savior, the slaughtered
   Lamb who stood in our place and put away sin by the sacrifice of
   Himself. Ah, seeking soul, if you know the weight of sin, and if you
   know that Christ carried it, then you can say, "Lord, I would have my
   sins forgiven," in answer to the question, "What do you want Me to do
   for you?"

   And yet salvation includes more than deliverance from Hell and a free
   pardon, for it emancipates the soul from its dominant power. Those
   among us who are saved from the guilt of sin are abundantly conscious
   that we are not fully released from the powerof sin in our own breasts.
   Loved ones who have passed beyond the stars and see God's face without
   a veil between, are saved, completely saved, from indwelling sin--but
   none of us here enjoy that blessed emancipation, though there are some
   who boast a perfection it were hard to prove! But, alas, they slightly
   prejudice their profession by their pride. Still, salvation from the
   despotic power of sin must be achieved and, in a high degree, it must
   be compassed by all Believers--or they shall never see God's face with
   acceptance. Brothers and Sisters, we must have our reigning sins
   subdued! Know you not that no drunk, or whoremonger, or covetous person
   that is an idolater, can have any inheritance in the Kingdom of God?
   These sins must be cut off! They must be slain and overcome! And as far
   as any other sins are concerned, they must be no longer citizens of the
   heart. You must look upon them as intruders and aliens that are to be

   driven out, like the Canaanites out of the land of promise. Mortify,
   therefore, your members! Subdue your lusts, overcome your corruptions.
   "But," the man replies, "how can I do this?" A most fitting question!
   You cannot do it, but Christ says, "What do you want Me to do for you?"
   His power is equal to every emergency. There is no sin too strong for
   Christ. During His sojourn on earth, there was no devil that He could
   not cast out, so there is no sin which He cannot eject and eradicate. A
   legion of devils fled at the fiat of our Lord. Doubt not that legions
   of furious lusts and fiery tempers can be overcome by the faith that
   pleads His prevailing name! Brothers and Sisters, let us never sit down
   content with small degrees of sanctification! Reason not with
   yourselves as though you could never get beyond your present dwarfed
   stature. Others have outgrown it. There have been men far more
   distinguished for piety, humility and every Grace, than we are. The
   attainments to which the Master has led them are accessible to all
   saints under the same guidance, through the same Divine Power. Let us
   aspire to holiness! Let us follow after it with fresh ardor. Be not
   satisfied merely to live, but seek to grow! Be not content to remain
   babies, taking your portion of milk, but seek to be strong men who
   shall enjoy the strong meat of the Word of God!

   Now I believe there are hundreds of persons who have no desire to be
   saved, and would rather not be saved, if this is what salvation means.
   Why, Man, if you are saved, you will be saved from those pleasurable
   sins in which you now are known to revel! Some of you, when you get a
   holiday, following the inclinations of a corrupt heart and a vicious
   taste, off you go to haunts where birds of your own feather congregate!
   Should you be saved, you will seek far different society. The company
   you now love, you will then hate, and the pleasures you enjoy so much,
   now, will become as detestable as they were delightful to you! When you
   say, "Lord, save me," do you mean, "Lord, save me from being what I am.
   Lord, I have been a drunk--make me sober. I have been unchaste--make me
   pure. I have been dishonest--make me upright. I have been
   deceitful--make me speak the truth to my neighbor. I have been
   violating Your statutes--make me mindful of Your Word. I have been Your
   enemy, Lord--make me Your friend. I have made my belly my god--now You
   be my God. I desire to be reconciled to You, so that Your will shall be
   my will, Your service my delight and Your way the path which I shall
   choose"? Do you mean that? If any man says honestly, "I do desire to be
   saved from sin," I do not think you will long have such a desire
   ungratified, but the Lord Jesus will say, "Your faith has made you
   whole." He can and He will save you, if that is what you mean!

   As for you good Christian people who are seeking the conversion of
   sinners, try to go about it in Christ's own way. It is right for you to
   exhort them to believe in Christ. I like to hear you sing--

   "There is life in a look at the Crucified One," but do remember that a
   man must have some understanding, both of what sin is and of what the
   Savior is, before he can believe, for "faith comes by hearing, and
   hearing by the Word of God," Endeavor, therefore, to instruct persons
   in the Gospel. Merely to exhort them to believe. Simply to cry,
   "Believe, believe, believe!" is of little worth, however earnest a man
   may be in raising that cry, for the sinner naturally enquires, "What is
   it that I have to believe? On whom am I to believe? For what reason am
   I to believe? Why do I need to believe?" So, go about your work of
   soul-winning in the power of the Holy Spirit! Go about it
   intelligently, understanding that as Jesus Christ would not open the
   blind man's eyes till He had first made him state, not for Christ's
   information, but for the man's own understanding, what it was that he
   wanted, and made him say, "Lord, that I may receive my sight," so must
   you endeavor, when you proclaim the Gospel, to let men know what their
   need of that Gospel is! Give them not merely the expostulations, the
   admonitions and the exhortations of the Gospel, but also give them its
   instructions! Or else you go and bid them come, and there is no feast.
   You invite them to the waters, but you do not tell them what the waters
   are! Let it be with you, then, henceforth to instruct sinners in the
   way of the Lord. As David says, "Then will I teach transgressors Your
   ways, and sinners shall be converted unto You." We will leave that
   first homily and proceed to a second. Our text clearly indicates to us
   all--

   II. THE GREAT NECESSITY OF PRAYING WITH A DIRECT OBJECTIVE.

   This poor man was not allowed to pray in general. "You Son of David,
   have mercy upon me!" A very proper prayer, and a very blessed prayer,
   but certainly it was a very wide prayer. So he was encouraged to be
   more specific in his request. "What do you want Me to do for you? You
   ask for mercy--what form of mercy do you need? In what particular shape
   shall the bountiful hand dispense the mercy to you?" The blind man at
   once replies, "Lord, that I may receive my sight!" He hits the mark
   with precision. It is sight he needs, and for sight he asks! This is
   the right way for Believers to pray. I wish we had more of it in our
   Prayer Meetings--I do not find fault, for we have had blessed seasons
   of prayer here--but

   rest assured that those are the best prayers in all respects, if they
   are earnest and sincere, which go most directly to the point. You know
   there is a way of praying in the closet and praying in the family in
   which you do not ask for anything. You say a great many good things,
   introduce much of your own experience, review the Doctrines of Grace
   very thoughtfully, but you do not ask for anything in particular. Such
   prayer is always uninteresting to listen to--and I think it must be
   rather tedious to those who offer it. A Negro, who was noted for his
   great earnestness in prayer, was once asked how it was that whenever he
   prayed, he seemed to be so earnest. And he said, "Because I always have
   an errand when I go to the King! I always have an errand. I go to Him
   knowing that I need something, and I ask Him for it, and I don't stop
   till He gives it to me. And if He does not give it to me, I ask Him
   again and again, for I know what I am doing." Of what use were it to
   keep on going in and out of a banker's door all day if you have no
   business to transact and nothing to get? But it is quite different when
   you go up to the counter with your check and receive in return the
   golden sovereigns. It would be very uninteresting to wait upon Her
   Majesty every morning and evening with an address which merely said,
   "Your Majesty's attached and most loyal subject," if you never asked
   for anything!

   Yet how much prayer of that kind is addressed to Heaven--sheet
   lightning prayer--not the forked flash that does the work, like
   shooting arrows up at the moon, instead of imitating David, when he
   said, "In the morning wiil I direct my prayer unto You." He looked at
   the target, marked the bull's-eye, then drew the bow! And after he had
   shot the arrow, he adds, "And will look up"--as if to see whether the
   arrow really went to the mark, whether the prayer had sped with God so
   that a gracious answer would be given! Should we not sometimes, when
   alone, and about to pray, sit down a little while to consider what we
   are about to ask? Should we not often pray better if we remembered that
   the preparation of the heart in man, as well as the answer of the
   tongue, is from the Lord--and that the preparation of the heart
   precedes the answer of the tongue? In offering our sacrifices to God,
   this helter-skelter ill becomes us! Not with heedless step should we
   rush into His Presence. The decorum which is due to a king's court
   might admonish us of the reverence due to the King of Kings! Although
   we enjoy the privileged familiarity which permits us to say, "Our
   Father," as dear children of the Lord of Heaven and Earth, let us never
   forget the humility that becomes us, the profound obeisance we owe as
   subjects of the great King. Tenderly He asks--"What do you want Me to
   do for You?"--devoutly should we answer

   Now, dear Friends, let me challenge a plain answer to a plain question.
   As you are sitting here in this House, what is your desire before the
   Lord? Let your conscience make such a reply that when you get home, you
   may intelligently, in the closing prayer of the day, approach the Lord
   for what you need. What is the upper-most desire of your soul? Perhaps
   with some it is that some besetting sin may be overcome. "Oh," you say,
   "what would I give could I but get rid of that bad temper of mine! It
   is my daily cross and I do not want to harbor it." "Ah," says another,
   "I am so unbelieving, a little trouble soon casts me down. Oh, that I
   could get rid of my unbelief!" Well now, very likely, dear Friends, the
   sin you ought to prayagainst is one you are not striving against. Were
   I to come to you in the aisle, and take you by the buttonhole and tell
   you what your principal sin is, you would feel very vexed with me, for
   we are apt to resent the faithfulness of those who tell us of our
   faults! To touch the tender place makes the nerves tingle and it seems
   like willful torture. When somebody complains of something which our
   conscience does not endorse, we take it kindly, and accept their good
   intentions, thinking that had they known us better, they would have
   esteemed us more highly. But if they really touch the sores where most
   they smart, we do not admire their treatment! The flush we feel--the
   blush we gladly would hide. Yet cloak not now the vice which an
   Omniscient God discerns! Let this be a time of heart-searching. Say,
   now, "Lord, is my sin, covetousness?" That is a sin which never yet did
   I hear a man confess!

   A Roman Catholic priest who had heard the confessions of some two
   thousand persons, said he had heard men confess heinous iniquities of
   every kind, even murder and adultery, but that he never had heard any
   man confess covetous-ness. This is a crime they christen and call it by
   another name! A covetous man thinks he is prudent--he is just laying by
   a little money for a rainy day. Their greed, they tell you, is not to
   gratify themselves, but a generous impulse to provide for their
   families--for their wives and their children--they would have us
   believe, they waste their strength and wither their souls.
   Nevertheless, their fortune is their fallacy. To grip and to grasp, to
   have and to hold is their desire as long as they live, and late enough
   they commonly leave it before they devise to their dear ones the
   possessions they can no longer retain! Alas, we are often wicked enough
   to try to make our affection an excuse for our avarice! Let us come to
   the point honestly. When we are dealing with our sin, let us confess it
   with all its iniquity and its heinousness. Do not dissemble by
   accepting a small share in a public company. David, when he wanted full
   discharge, said, "Deliver me from blood-

   guiltiness." He acknowledged the atrocity when he sought the
   Atonement--"Forgive my blood-guiltiness"--as one who saw his crime in
   the light of its consequence, not as one who attempted to palliate it
   with vain excuses! "What do you want Me to do for you in that matter?"

   If you have no particular sin to confess--if that is not your uppermost
   anxiety at this time--what, then, is your petition? What need have you
   to be supplied? Is it some great need? Have you numerous little needs?
   They may all be told to God! Get a clear idea of what it is that you
   really need that He should do for you, knowing that whatever your
   necessities may be, there is the promise, "My God shall supply all your
   need"--not some of it, but, "all your need"--not He maydo it, but He
   shalldo it! Not, you will have to supply it yourselves, but Hewill
   supply it--"My God shall supply all your need." Think, therefore, what
   your need is, and then go to God! Is there any choice blessing that you
   desire? Get a clear idea of the blessing before you pray for it. What
   form of blessing would you wish to have? Oh, if I might have my choice,
   it would be heavenly-mindedness! Oh, if a man could but get that, he
   need not make much account of where he lived, nor what he had to eat,
   nor how much he slept, nor how much he suffered--for a heavenly mind is
   Heaven! The mind makes its own Heaven here below, and up above. Though,
   doubtless, Heaven has a locality--yet it is much more a state than a
   place. Oh, for more heavenly-mindedness! What is it you would have?
   Communion with Christ? Love to souls? A broken heart? True humility? I
   may say of all these things, "The land is before you, that you may go
   forward and possess it. Ask what you will and it shall be done unto
   you."

   What promise is there that you would wish to have fulfilled to you
   tonight? It is a good exercise to sit down before evening prayer and
   look up the promise that seems most suitable, or to ask the Lord to
   look it up for you, and apply it to your soul? Take this promise, if so
   be there is disease next door, "Lord, You have said, 'Thousands shall
   fall at your side, and tens of thousands at your right hand, but it
   shall not come near you.' Lord, fulfill that promise now." Are you
   startled by a noise in the dead of night? Then quote this promise, "You
   shall not be afraid of the terror by night." Perhaps it is shortness of
   provision that troubles you. Then here is another promise, "Your bread
   shall be given you, and your water shall be sure." When you lost a key
   the other day, and could not open the drawer, what did you do? You sent
   out for a locksmith and in he came with a whole bundle of old rusty
   keys. What for? Why, he looked for one that fit the lock of your
   drawer, and opened it for you at once! Now many people's Bibles are
   just like that bundle of rusty keys. There is always a key in the Bible
   that will fit the wards in the lock of your necessities, if you would
   but seek till you find it. But sometimes we are in distress, as
   Christian and Hopeful were in Doubting Castle, and we have to say, as
   Christian did, "What a fool I am to lie rotting in this stinking
   dungeon when I have a key in my bosom that I am persuaded would open
   every lock in Doubting Castle!" Search out the promises, then, and go
   before God with a distinct answer to the question, "What do you want Me
   to do for you?" "Lord, I would have that promise fulfilled, or that
   Grace bestowed, or that need supplied, or that sin forgiven."

   So, dear Friends, in intercessory prayer, it is very necessary, I
   think, in order to keep up our own interest in it, that we should have
   distinct objectives. I do not find that I can pray for all mankind
   anything like so fervently as I can pray for my own children. I do not
   find that I can pray for the nation as well as I can for London. When I
   pray for London, I seek to do it earnestly. It behooves us to pray for
   all men, according to Scripture. All sorts of men are to be included in
   our supplications. I must, however, confess that I am most fervent in
   prayer when I pray for this congregation, and that because I have the
   most vivid thought of this people, and the clearest idea of their
   present requirements. If you want to pray for any particular person, or
   any special objective, the better you understand the case you have in
   hand, the warmer and livelier your pleading will be. There are people
   in this Chapel who have asked me to pray for them. Well, I have tried
   to do so, and I hope the Lord heard my prayer. But since I have known
   more of them, and found out where they live, and who they were, I can
   pray for them with more freedom than I could before. They were a sort
   of abstraction to me once--I have a definite acquaintance with them
   now. How easily you remember anything that is tied to something else,
   or linked by association with a place. Thus you recollect a transaction
   that occurred to you in the City of London. Every time that you go by
   the Bank, just at one spot, you say, "I met so-and-so just here the day
   before he died." You will never forget it, but you think of it every
   time you go by. Or perhaps at the corner of a road in the country, just
   by a hand-post, such-and-such a thing happened to you, and the site of
   land revokes the circumstance. Thus we recollect our friends in prayer
   when we get a knowledge of them, call them up before our mind's eye,
   and knit, as it were, the secret interests with what we have seen of
   them when we have talked to them and been interested in their trials.

   Some good people have prayed for others by name. Well, you cannot do
   that if you have a long list and happen to be a busy man. Still, it is
   good to pray for others by name if you can. I like those prayers, even
   in public, in which men do pray for others with some distinctness. Oh,
   what time we waste when we go beating around the bush! We know
   individuals who pray for their minister with a circumlocution that
   distracts the listener. They travel round and round a circle, instead
   of going at once to the point. A man hardly likes to say, "Lord, save
   my wife." He prefers talking about "those who are dear to us in the
   ties of consanguinity, and she who is the partner of our being." Yes,
   that sounds pretty, very pretty, indeed, but would it not be as well if
   you said at once, "Lord, convert my wife"? There is one Brother here
   who does pray in that way at the Prayer Meetings, and who uses those
   very words. When pleading with God, do let us come straight to the
   mark, knowing what we are doing, ourselves and, therefore, stating our
   case plainly in answer to the question, "What do you want Me to do for
   you?" May the Lord teach us to pray in this distinct manner! Time fails
   us, therefore we will only mention a third point. Our Lord Jesus
   Christ, in asking this question of the blind man, makes--

   III. NO RESERVATION, BUT THROWS OPEN THE PLENITUDE OF HIS HEART AND THE
   BOUNDLESSNESS OF HIS POWER.

   "What do you want Me to do for you?" is tantamount to saying, "Whatever
   it is, I will do it. I can do it. Only tell Me what you want." There is
   no bound to the Savior's ability! Nor does He put a limit on the
   suppliant's leave to command the favor he desires. It was not, then,
   for the blind man to say, "Lord, if You will." He has the opportunity
   of procuring any blessing he solicits. Mark, Brothers and Sisters, it
   is no question of "can" with regard to Christ! The question is, what do
   you desire? Now, Sinner, observe the Lord Jesus Christ did not stop to
   enquire about this man's blindness, whether he had been blind from
   birth, or whether he had been affected with a cataract or any other
   form of ocular disease. He just said, "What do you want Me to do for
   you?" No species of ophthalmia could baffle Him! In any form, or at any
   stage, it was possible for Him to cure it! The Lord Jesus Christ speaks
   to you. He says to you today, "Whoever will, let Him come and take of
   the Water of Life freely." He does not say anything as to whether you
   have been moral or immoral, whether you have been profane or religious,
   but simply, "What do you want Me to do for you?" Your blackest sins
   will disappear the moment the scarlet of the blood touches them! Your
   foulest crimes shall melt like snow as soon as the thaw begins. You
   cannot have sinned yourself beyond the reach of the long arm of Christ,
   nor can the weight of your sin be too heavy for the back of Christ, the
   great Sin-Bearer, to bear! Whatever your iniquities, though they are
   red like scarlet, they shall be as wool! Though they are as crimson,
   they shall be whiter than snow! Some of us would have no hope if we did
   not know that Christ will save the chief of sinners. We would long
   since have sunk into remorse and despair if we had not seen it written
   in letters of gold--"He that comes unto Me, I will in no wise cast
   out." You know what John Bunyan said about that text? He said, "Who is
   this man? Who is this, 'he that comes'? Why, any 'he that comes' in all
   the world, be he who he may, He will in no wise, under no pretext, for
   no reason and in no way, ever cast him out!" If you come to Christ, He
   will keep His word! He cannot be a liar! He must be as good as His own
   declaration! If you come to Him, He will not cast you out! What do you
   want Him to do for you?

   Oh, Believer, have you a desire upon your soul--have you a longing in
   your heart? Then Christ does not say that He will give you this mercy,
   if it is possible, but He is able to do for you exceedingly abundantly
   above what you ask or even think! I hear that text still quoted by some
   of my Brothers and Sisters, "Above all that we can ask or even think."
   I beg their pardon--that is not a faithful quotation of Scripture! It
   says, "Above all that we ask or think"--above all that we do ask! God
   can open a man's mouth as wide as His mercies and He can make us ask
   for anything, but He generally does for us above all that we ask or
   think! Never keep your mouth closed because you think the mercy to be
   too great. "He that spared not His own Son, but freely delivered Him up
   for us all, how shall He not also, with Him, freely give us all
   things?" Do not stint yourself! Enlarge your desire! Open your mouth
   wide and He will fill it! He gives you carte blanche--ask for what you
   will! He puts it before you, "Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He
   will give you the desire of your heart." So may it be to us, according
   to our faith, and His shall be the Glory! Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: LUKE 13:10-23.

   Verses 10-12. And He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the
   Sabbath, and, behold, there was a woman which hada spirit ofinfrmity
   eighteen years, and was bent over, and couldin no wise lift herself up.
   And when Jesus saw her-- With that quick eye of His which was always in
   sympathy with His audience.

   12-14. He called her to Him, and said unto her, Woman you are loosed
   from your infirmity. And He laid His hands on her: and immediately she
   was made straight, and glorified God. And the ruler of the synagogue
   answered with indignation because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, and
   said unto the people--In what a cold-blooded, heartless manner he must
   have said it, you may well imagine. For a man not to rejoice when he
   saw his poor fellow creature thus healed, shows that he must have been
   destitute of much milk of human kindness and that bigotry had dried up
   his soul.

   14. There are six days in which men ought to work: in them, therefore,
   come and be healed, but not on the Sabbath. He did not dare to speak to
   Christ. I suppose the majesty of Christ's manner overawed him, so he
   struck directly at the people--and at Christ through them. Now our Lord
   did not go sideways to work when He replied to him.

   15-17. The Lord then answeredhim, andsaid, You hypocrite, does not each
   one ofyou on the Sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and
   lead him away to watering? And ought not this woman, being a daughter
   of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed
   from this bond on the Sabbath? And when He had said these things, all
   His adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the
   glorious things that were done by Him. The Jews had reduced the Sabbath
   to a day of idleness and luxury. The only thing they forbade themselves
   was the doing of anything. Now the Sabbath was never intended to be
   spent in idleness and luxury. It should be spent in the worship of God
   and works of mercy and works of piety make the Sabbath holy, instead of
   being contrary to its demands. And our Savior, by giving rest to that
   poor burdened woman was, in truth, making Sabbath in her body and in
   her soul.

   18, 19. Then He said, Unto what is the Kingdom of God like? And to what
   shall I compare it? It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man
   took and cast into his garden; and it grew and became a large tree: and
   the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it A little Grace grows
   and becomes great Grace. If you have at present but little faith, be
   thankful for that little! Bring it to Christ! Let it feed upon Him and
   your mustard seed will grow till it becomes a tree! The same is true of
   the Gospel throughout the world. We need never be afraid because we
   happen to be few in number. If we have got the Truth of God, the Truth
   will live. And if the Truth is as small as the mustard seed, there is
   life in it-- vitality in it, and it is sure to grow before long! We
   must not be afraid to be in the minority. Majorities are not always
   right. Are they ever? Perhaps sometimes.

   20, 21. And again He said, Unto what shall I liken the Kingdom of God?
   It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of
   meal, till the whole was leavened. Some read this as a parable to set
   forth the power of evil, and I do not doubt that it does set it forth.
   At the same time it sets forth the power of good, too, for it is put
   side by side with the other as the likeness of the Kingdom of God. And
   the Truth of God in the soul does work, ferment and permeate the entire
   nature if it is placed there!

   22, 23. And He went through the cities and villages, teaching, and
   journeying toward Jerusalem. Then said one to Him, Lord, are there few
   who are saved?That is a question that I have heard a great many times.
   What is the fascination that makes men so fond of asking it? I think
   that some ask it as if they almost hoped that there would be few. If
   they do not go to our Ebenezer or Rehoboth, what can become of them?
   Surely you cannot expect that there should be any good come to those
   that do not frequent Salem and Enod. What must they hope? In that
   spirit the question is often asked, but, Brothers and Sisters, may God
   lift us up above that spirit and make us desire that there should be
   great multitudes saved! I suppose that one of the surprises of Heaven
   will be to see vastly many more there than we ever dreamt would reach
   that place. Jesus Christ gave a very practical answer. It was no
   answer, and yet was the best of answers.

   23. And He said unto them, Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for
   many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.Make
   a push for it! Agonize for it, for many will seek--not strive, but
   merely seek. Or, to put another meaning into it, strive now to enter in
   at the strait gate, for many will be unable, when it is too late--and
   that, doubtless, is the sense of the passage.

Preparation for Heaven

   (No. 3538)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has also
   given us the earnest of the Spirit." 2 Corinthians 5:5.

   HOW very confidently Paul contemplates the prospect of death! He
   betrays no trembling apprehensions. With the calmness and serenity, not
   merely of resignation and submission, but of assurance and courage, he
   appears joyous and gladsome, and even charmed with the hope of having
   his body dissolved and being girt about with the new body which God has
   prepared for His saints! He that can talk of the grave and of the
   hereafter with such intelligence, thoughtfulness, faith and strong
   desire as Paul did, is a man to be envied. Princes might well part with
   their crown for such a sure and certain hope of immortality! Could
   emperors exchange their treasures, their honors and their dominions, to
   stand side by side with the humble tent-maker in his poverty, they
   would be great gainers. Were they but able to say with him, "We are
   always confident, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to
   be present with the Lord," they might well barter earthly rank for such
   a requital! This side of Heaven, what can be more heavenly than to be
   thoroughly prepared to pass through the River of Death? On the other
   hand, what a dreary and dreadful state of mind must they be in who,
   with nothing before them but to die, have no hope and see no
   outlet--the pall and the shroud their last adorning--the grave and the
   sod their destination! Without hope of rising again in a better future,
   or realizing a better heritage than that which should know us no more
   before long--no prospects of seeing God face to face with
   rejoicing--well may men dislike any reference to death! So they shrink
   from the thought of it. Far less can they tolerate its being talked of
   in common conversation. No marvel that they recoil from the shade of
   mortality when they are so ill prepared to face the reality of the
   soul's departure! But, dear Friends, since it is so desirable to be
   ready to depart, it cannot be inexpedient sometimes to talk about
   it--and on my part the more so, because there is a proneness in all our
   minds to start aside from that grave topic which, as God shall help us,
   shall be our subject this evening--preparation for the great hereafter!
   "For," says the Apostle, "God has worked us for this same thing"--He
   has prepared us for the dropping of the present body and the putting on
   of the next! And "He has given us the earnest of His Spirit."

   Our three departments of meditation will be--the work of preparation
   itself. The Author of it. And the seal which He sets to it--the
   possession of which may resolve all scruples as to whether we are
   prepared or not.

   I. THE WORK OF PREPARATION stands first. Is it not almost universally
   admitted that some preparation is absolutely essential? Whenever the
   death of a friend or comrade is announced, you will hear the
   worst-instructed say, "I hope, poor man, he was prepared." It may be
   but a passing reflection or a common saying. Yet everybody will give
   expression to it, "I hope he was ready." Whether the words are well
   understood or not, I do not know, but the currency given to them proves
   a unanimous conviction that some preparation is necessary for the next
   world. And, in truth, this thought is in accordance with the most
   elementary facts of our holy religion. Men by nature need something to
   be done for them before they can enter Heaven--and something to be done
   in them. Something to be done with them, for by nature they are enemies
   to God. Dispute it as you will, God knows best. He declares that we are
   enemies to Him, and alienated in our hearts. We need, therefore, that
   some Ambassador should come to us with terms of peace and reconcile us
   to God. We are debtors as well as enemies to our Creator--debtors to
   His Law. We owe Him what we cannot pay and what He cannot pardon. He
   must exact obedience and we cannot render it! He must, as God, demand
   perfection of us, and we, as men, cannot bring Him that perfection.
   Some Mediator, then, must come in to pay the debt for us, for we cannot
   pay it. Neither can we be exempted from it. There must be a Substitute
   who shall stand between us and God--One who shall undertake all our
   liabilities and discharge them--and so set us free, so that the mercy
   of God may be extended to us!

   In addition to this, we are all criminals. Having violated the Law of
   God, we are already condemned. We are not, as some vainly pretend,
   introduced to this world on probation. Our probation is over--we have
   forfeited all hope! We have broken the Law of God and the sentence is
   gone out against us--and we stand by nature as condemned criminals,
   tenants of this world during the reprieve of God's mercy, in fear of a
   certain and terrible execution--unless Someone comes in between us and
   that punishment--unless some gracious hand brings us a free pardon!
   Unless some Divine Voice pleads and prevails for us that we may be
   acquitted! If this is not done for us, it is impossible that we should
   entertain any well-grounded hope of entering Heaven. Say, then,
   Brothers and Sisters, has this been done for you? I know that many of
   you can answer, "Blessed be God, I have been reconciled to Him through
   the death of His Son! God is no enemy of mine, nor I of Him--there is
   no distance, now, between me and God--I am brought near to Him and made
   to feel that He is near to me and that I am dear to Him." Full many
   here present can add, "My debts to God are paid! I have looked to
   Christ, my Substitute. I have seen Him enter into Suretyship
   engagements for me and I am persuaded that He has discharged all my
   liabilities! I am clean before God's bar! Faith tells me I am clean."
   And, Brothers and Sisters, you know that you are no longer condemned!
   You have looked to Him who bore your condemnation and you have drunk in
   the spirit of that verse, "There is, therefore, now no condemnation to
   them who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after
   the Spirit." Surely this is a preparation for Heaven! How could we
   enter there if our debts were not discharged? How could we eternally
   obtain the Divine Favor if we were still condemned criminals? How could
   we dwell forever in the Presence of God if we were still His enemies?
   Come, let us rejoice in this--that He has worked us for this same
   thing--having championed our cause from the cradle to the grave!

   Preparation for Heaven consists still further in something that must be
   worked in us, for observe, Brothers and Sisters, that if the Lord were
   to blot out all our sins, we would still be quite incapable of entering
   Heaven unless there was a change worked in our natures. According to
   this Book, we are dead by nature in trespasses and sins--not some of
   us, but all of us--the best as well as the worst! We are all dead in
   trespasses and sins. Shall dead men sit at the feasts of the Eternal
   God? Shall there be corpses at the celestial banquets? Shall the pure
   air of the New Jerusalem be defiled with the putrefaction of iniquity?
   It must not, it cannot be! We must be quickened--we must be taken from
   the corruption of our old nature into the incorruption of the new
   nature, receiving the incorruptible Seed which lives and abides
   forever. Only the living children can inherit the promises of the
   living God, for He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. We
   must be made living creatures by the new-creating power of Grace, or
   else we cannot be made meet for Glory. By nature we are all worldly.
   Our thoughts go after earthly things. We "mind earthly things," as the
   Apostle says. We seek after the world's joys. The world's maxims govern
   us. The world's fears alarm us, the world's hopes and ambitions excite
   us. We are of the earth, earthy, for we bear the image of the first
   Adam. But, Brothers and Sisters, we cannot go to Heaven as worldly men,
   for there would be nothing there to gratify us. The gold of Heaven is
   not for barter to use, nor for cove-tousness to hoard. The rivers of
   Heaven are not for commerce, neither are they to be defiled by men. The
   joys and glories of Heaven are all spiritual, all celestial--

   "PPure are the joys above the skies And all the region peace."

   Such peace is of a heavenly kind, and for heavenly minds. Carnal
   spirits, greedy, envious spirits--what would they do in Heaven? If they
   were in the place called Heaven, they could not be in the state called
   Heaven, and Heaven is more a state than a place! Though it is probably
   both, yet it is mainly the former, a state of happiness, a state of
   holiness, a state of spirituality which it would not be possible for
   the worldly to reach! Therefore, you see, Brothers and Sisters, the
   Holy Spirit must come and give us new affections. We must have a fresh
   objective set before us. In fact, instead of minding the things that
   are seen, we must come to love and to aspire to the things that are not
   seen! Our affections, instead of going downwards to things of earth,
   must be allured by things that are above, where Christ sits at the
   right hand of God!

   In addition to our spiritual death and worldliness, we are all unholy
   by nature. Not one of us is pure in the sight of God. We are all
   defiled and all defiling, but in Heaven they are "without fault before
   the Throne of God." No sin is tolerated there--no sin of thought, or
   word, or deed! Angels and glorified spirits delight to do God's will
   without hesitation, without demur, without omission. And we, like they,
   must be holy, or we cannot enter into their sacred fellowship--

   "Those holy gates forever bar Pollution, sin, and shame!

   None shall obtain admission there But followers of the Lamb."

   So what a change must come over the carnal man to make him holy!
   Through what washings he must pass! What can wash him white, indeed,
   but that far-famed blood of the Son of God? Through purification he
   must pass! What, indeed, can purify him at all but the refining energy
   of God the Holy Spirit? He alone can make us what God would have us to
   be, renewed in His image in holiness and righteousness!

   That a great change must be worked in us, even ungodly men will
   confess, since the idea of the Heaven of the Scriptures has always been
   repulsive, never agreeable, to unconverted men and women. When Mohammed
   would charm the world into the belief that he was the Prophet of God,
   the Heaven he pictured was not at all the Heaven of holiness and
   spirituality. His was a Heaven of unbridled sensualism, where all the
   passions were to be enjoyed without let or hindrance for endless years!
   Such a Heaven that sinful men would like--therefore, such the Heaven
   that Mohammed painted for them, and promised to them! Men in general,
   be they courtly, or be they coarse in their habits, when they read of
   Heaven in the Scriptures with any understanding of what they read, curl
   their lips and ask contemptuously, Who wants to be everlastingly
   singing Psalms? Who could wish to be always sitting down with these
   saints talking about the mighty acts of the Lord and the glorious
   majesty of His Kingdom? Such people cannot go to Heaven, it is
   clear--they have not character or capacity to enter into its enjoyment!
   I think Whitefield was right. Could a wicked man be admitted into
   Heaven, he would be wretched there--being unholy, he must be unhappy.
   From sheer distaste for the society of Heaven, he might fly to Hell for
   shelter! With the tumult of evil passions in his breast, he could not
   brook the triumph of righteousness in the city of the blest. There is
   no Heaven for him who has not been prepared for it by a work of Grace
   in his soul. So necessary is this preparation--a preparation for us,
   and a preparation in us. And if we ever have such a preparation, beyond
   all question we must have it on this side of our death. It can only be
   obtained in this world. The moment one breathes his last, it is all
   fixed and settled. As the tree falls, so it must lie. While the nature
   is soft and supple it is susceptible to impression, stamp what seal you
   may upon it. Once let it grow cold and hard, fixed and frigid, you can
   do so no more, it is proof against any change. While the iron is
   flowing into the mold you can fashion it into what implement you
   please. Let it grow cold, in vain you strive to alter its form! With
   pen of liquid ink in your hand you write what you will on the paper,
   but the ink dries, the impress remains, and where is the treachery that
   shall tamper with it? Such is this life of yours. It is over, all over
   with you for eternity, beyond alteration or amending when the breath
   has gone from the body. Your everlasting state is fixed then--

   "There are no acts of pardon passed

   In the cold grave to which we hasten,

   But darkness, death, and long despair

   Reign in eternal silence there." We have no intimation in the Word of
   God that any soul dying in unbelief will afterwards be converted to the
   faith. Nor have we the slightest reason to believe that our prayers in
   this world can at all affect those who have departed this life. The
   masses of priests are fictions, without the shadow of Divine Authority.
   "Purgatory," or "Pick-Purse," as old Latimer used to call it, is an
   invention for making fat larders for priests and monks! The Scriptures
   of the Truth of God give it no countenance. The Word of God says, "He
   that is holy, let him be holy still; he that is filthy, let him be
   filthy still." Such as you are when death comes to you, such will
   judgment find you, and such will the eternal reward or the eternal
   punishment leave you, world without end! Preparation is needed--and the
   preparation must be found before we die.

   Moreover, we ought to know--for it is possible for a man to know
   whether he is thoroughly prepared. Some have said not, but they have
   usually been persons very little acquainted with the matter. The
   writings of those grand old divines of the Puritan period abundantly
   prove how thoroughly they enjoyed the assurance of faith! They did not
   hesitate to express themselves in such language as the Apostle
   used--"We know that if this earthly house of our tabernacle is
   dissolved, we have a house not made with hands, eternal in the
   heavens." They were known to speak as Job did when he said, "I know
   that my Redeemer lives." And indeed, many of the children of God among
   us at this present time are favored with a confident, unstaggering
   confidence that, let their last hour come when it may, or let the Lord,
   Himself, descend from Heaven with a shout--there will be nothing but
   joy and peace for them--no cause for trembling, nothing that can

   give them dismay! Why, some of us live from year to year in constant
   assurance of our preparation for the bliss that awaits and the rest
   that remains for God's people!

   Beloved, God has not so left us in such a dubious case that we always
   need to be enquiring, "Am I His, or am I not?" He has given us good
   substantial grounds to go upon to make sure work of it. He tells us
   that, "he that believes and is baptized shall be saved"--if we have
   been obedient to these two commands, we shall be saved, for our God
   keeps His word! He tells us that such Believers, patiently continuing
   in well-doing, inherit eternal life. If we are kept by His Grace,
   walking in His fear, we may rest assured that we shall come to the
   ultimate end of such a life, namely, the Glory which abides for the
   faithful! We need not harbor endless questions. What miserable work it
   is to stand in any doubt on this matter! Let us not be satisfied till
   we are sure and confident that Heaven will be ours! Alas, how many put
   off all thoughts of being prepared to die! They are prepared for almost
   anything except the one thing for which it is most necessary to be
   ready. If the summons should come to some of you at this moment, how
   dread it would be! Were we to see an angel hovering in the air, and
   should we have intelligence by a message from the clouds that one of us
   must, on a sudden, leave his body behind him and appear before God,
   what cowering down, what trembling, what muttering of forgotten prayers
   there would be with some of you! You are not ready! You never will be
   ready, I fear. The carelessness in which you have lived so long has
   become habitual. One would think you had resolved to die in your sins!
   Have you ever heard the story of Archaeus, the Grecian despot, who was
   going to a feast, and on the way a messenger brought him a letter and
   seriously importuned him to read it? It contained tidings of a
   conspiracy that had been formed against him, that he would be killed at
   the feast. He took the letter and put it in his pocket. In vain the
   messenger urged that it was concerning serious matters. "Serious
   matters, tomorrow," said Archaeus, "feasting, tonight!" That night the
   dagger reached his heart while he had about him the warning which, had
   he heeded it, would have averted the peril!

   Alas, too many men say, "Serious things tomorrow!" They have no
   misgiving that when their sport is over, they will have alike the
   leisure and the leanings for these weighty matters. Were it not wiser,
   Sirs, to let these grave affairs come first? Might you not, then, find
   some better sport of nobler character than all the froth and frivolity
   to which fashion leads on--a holy merriment and a sacred feasting that
   well become immortal spirits? How vain and groveling the mirth which
   reduces men to children, pleased with a rattle, tickled with a
   straw--then brings them down to driveling fools and often degrades them
   till they become worse than brutes! I wish I could imprint a solemn
   thought on the mind of some careless individuals. Reckon you not that
   time is short, that life is precarious, that opportunities cross your
   path at lightning speed, that hope flatters those on whom the fangs of
   death are fixed, that there is no vestibule in which to fit your frame
   of mind, that the shock will always come suddenly at last? What
   sentence more trite? What sentiment more prevalent? Yet what solemnity
   more neglected than this--"Prepare to meet your God"? Propound it,
   profess it, preach it as we may, the most of men are unprepared! They
   know the inevitable plight. They see the necessity of preparation, but
   they postpone and procrastinate, instead of preparing! God grant you
   may not trifle, any of you, until your trembling souls are launched
   into that unknown sphere, but not unfeared, and read your doom in Hell.
   Now--

   II. AS TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS PREPARATION FOR DEATH, the text says, "He
   that has worked us for the

   same thing is God." It is God, alone, then, who makes men fit for
   Heaven! He works them to the same purpose. Who made Adam fit for
   Paradise but God? And who must make us fit for the better Paradise
   above but God? That we cannot do it ourselves is evident. According to
   the Scriptures, we are dead in trespasses and sins. Can the dead start
   from the grave of their own accord? Do you think to see coffins opened
   and gravestones uplifted by the natural energy of corpses? Such things
   were never dreamed of! The dead shall surely rise, but they shall rise
   because God raises them. They cannot vitalize their inert frames,
   neither can the dead in sin quicken themselves and make themselves fit
   for the Presence of God! Conversion, which prepares us for Heaven, is a
   new creation. That word, "creation," puts all the counsel, the conceit
   and the contrivance of man into the background. If anyone says that he
   can make a new heart, let him first go and make a fly. Not until he has
   created such a winged insect, let him presume to tell us that he can
   make a man a new creature in Christ Jesus! And yet to make a fly would
   not demonstrate that a fly could make itself--and it would offer but a
   feeble pretext for that wonderful creation which is supposed in a man's
   making himself a new heart! The original Creation was the work of God,
   and the New Creation must likewise be of God! To take away a heart of
   stone and give a heart of flesh is a miracle. Man cannot do it--if he
   attempts it--it shall be to his own shame and confusion. The Lord must
   make us anew! Have not we who know something of the Lord's working in
   us, this same thing, been made to feel that it is all of His

   Grace ? What first made us think about eternal things? Did we, the
   stray sheep, come back to the fold of our own accord? No! Far from it--

   "Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wandering from the fold of God."

   And ever since we have been living men in Christ Jesus. To whom must we
   ascribe our preservation and our progress? Must we not attribute every
   victory over sin and every advance in the spiritual life, to the
   operation of God, and nothing at all to ourselves? A poor simpleton
   once said, "'Twas God and I did the work." "Well, but, Charlie, what
   part did you take in it?" "Surely, then," he said, "I did all I could
   to stop the Lord, and He beat me." I suppose, did we tell the simple
   truth, we could say much the same. In the matter of our salvation, we
   do all we can to oppose it--our old nature does-- and He overcomes our
   evil propensities. From first to last, Jesus Christ has to be the
   Author and the Finisher of our salvation, or it never would have been
   begun, and it never would have been completed!

   Think, Beloved, of what fitness for Heaven is. To be fit for Heaven a
   man must be perfect! Go, you who think you can prepare yourselves--be
   perfect for a day! The vanity of your own mind, the provocation of this
   treacherous world and the subtle temptation of the devil would make
   short work of your empty pretensions! You would be blown about like
   chaff. Creature perfection, indeed! Was ever anything so absurd? Men
   have boasted of attaining it, but their very boasts have proved that
   they possessed it not! He that gets nearest to perfection is the very
   man who sighs and cries over the abiding infirmities of his flesh. No,
   if perfection is to be reached--and it must be, or we shall not be fit
   for Heaven--it must be worked by the operation of God! Man's work is
   never perfect--it is always marred on the wheel. His best machinery may
   still be improved upon! His finest productions of art might still be
   excelled. God alone is Perfect and He alone is the Perfecter. Blessed
   be God, we can heartily subscribe to this Truth, "He that has worked us
   for the same thing is

   God."

   But what shall I say to those of you, my Friends, who have no
   acquaintance with God? You certainly cannot be fitted for Heaven! Your
   cause is not committed to Him. He is doing nothing for you. He has not
   begun the good work in you. You live in this world as if there were no
   God. The thought, the stupendous thought of his "Being" does not affect
   you. You would not act any differently if there were 20 Gods or if
   there were no God. You utterly ignore His claims on your allegiance and
   your responsibility to His Law. Virtually in thought and deed you are
   without God in the world. Poor forlorn creature, you have forgotten
   your Creator! Poor wandering Soul, you have fallen out of gear with the
   universe! You have become alienated from the great Father who is in
   Heaven! I tremble at the thought. To be on the wide sea without rudder
   or compass--to be lost in the wilderness where there is no way!
   Cheerless as your condition is, remember this--though you see not God,
   God sees you. God sees you now! He hears you now. If you breathe but a
   desire towards Him, that desire shall be accepted and fulfilled! He
   will yet begin to work in you that gracious preparation which shall
   make you meet to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in
   light! And now, thirdly--

   III. LET THE SEAL OF THIS PREPARATION be briefly, but attentively
   considered.

   The Apostle says, "He that has worked us for the same thing is God, who
   also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit." Employers frequently
   pay during the week, a part of the wages which will be due on Saturday
   night. God gives His Holy Spirit, as it were, to be a part of the
   reward which He intends to give to His people, when, like hirelings,
   they have fulfilled their day. Our country friends just before harvest
   go out into the fields and they pick half a dozen ears that are ripe,
   braid the ends and hang them up over the mantle shelf as a kind of
   earnest of the harvest. So God gives us His Holy Spirit to be in our
   hearts as an earnest of Heaven--and as the ears of corn are of the same
   quality and character as the harvest, so the gift of the Holy Spirit is
   the foretaste of Heaven. When you have Him, you have a plain indication
   to your soul of what Heaven will be! You have a part of Heaven--"a
   young Heaven," as Dr. Watts somewhere calls it, within you!

   Ask yourself, then, dear Hearer, this question, "Have I received the
   earnest of the Spirit?" If so, you have the preparation for Heaven! If
   not, you are still a stranger to Divine things and you have no reason
   to believe that the Heaven of the saints will be your heritage. Come,
   now, have you received the Holy Spirit? Do, you reply, "How may I
   know?" Wherever the Holy Spirit is, He works certain Graces in the
   soul--repentance, to wit. Have you ever repented of sin? I mean, do you
   hate it? Do you shun it? Do you grieve to think you should once have
   loved it? Is your mind altogether changed with regard to sin, so that
   what once seemed pleasure is now pain, and all the sweetness of sin is
   poison to your

   taste? Where the Holy Spirit is, repentance is followed by the whole
   train of Graces, all in a measure, not any in perfection, for there is
   always room to grow in Grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ! Such
   is patience, which submits to the Lord's will. Such, too, the gracious
   disposition of forgiveness, which enables us to bear injuries and to
   forgive those that vex us. Such, likewise, that holy courage which is
   not ashamed to acknowledge our Lord, or to defend His cause. In fact,
   where the Holy Spirit is bestowed, all the Graces of the Spirit will be
   communicated in some degree. Though they will all need to grow, still
   there will be the seeds of them all. Where the Holy Spirit is, there
   will be the joy! No delight can be more animating or more elevating
   than that which springs from the indwelling of God in the soul! Think
   of God coming to abide in this poor bosom! Why, were a cross of
   diamonds or pearls glittering on your breast, some might envy you the
   possession of such a treasure--but to have God within your breast is
   infinitely better! God dwells in us and we in Him. Oh, sacred mystery!
   Oh, birth of unspeakable joy! Oh, well of Divine bliss that makes earth
   like Heaven! Have you ever had this joy--the joy of knowing that you
   are pardoned? The joy of being sure that you are a child of God? The
   joy of being certain that all things work together for your good? The
   joy of expecting that before long, and the sooner the better, you shall
   be forever beyond gunshot of fear, and care, and pain, and need? Where
   the Spirit of God is, there is more or less of this joy, which is the
   earnest of Heaven!

   This gift, moreover, will be conspicuously evidenced by a living faith
   in the Lord Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit is not in you if you rely on
   anything but Jesus--but if, as a poor guilty sinner, you have come to
   Him, partaken of His gracious pardon, kissed His blessed feet, and are
   now depending upon Him, alone--you have received the Holy Spirit and
   you have got a foretaste of Heaven!

   Brothers and Sisters, it is intensely desirable that we should seek
   more to be consciously filled with the Holy Spirit. We get easily
   contented with a little spiritual blessedness. Let us grow more
   covetous of the best gifts. Let us crave to be endued with the Holy
   Spirit and to be baptized in the Holy Spirit and in fire. The more we
   get of Him, the more assurance we shall have of Heaven for our peace,
   the more foretastes of Heaven for our happiness and the more
   preparation for Heaven in lively hope!

   Thus have I shown you the need of preparation, the Author of
   preparation and the great Seal which proves the truth of that
   preparation. If your honest conscience allows your humble claim to have
   received this sacred token of salvation, how happy you would be! Do not
   be afraid to be happy! Some Christians seem to court the gloom of
   despondency as if they dared not bask in the sunshine of Heaven. I have
   sometimes heard people say that they have not enjoyed themselves. No,
   dear Friends, pity, I think , if any of us ever should! It would be a
   poor kind of enjoyment if we merely enjoyed ourselves. But, oh, it is
   delightful when you can enjoy your God and when you can enjoy the
   mercies that are in Him, the promises that are in Him and the blessings
   which, through Him, come to you! When you gather round the Table of the
   Lord's Love, do not be afraid to partake of the feast! There is nothing
   put there to be looked at. There is no confectionery spread out for
   show. If you dare conclude that you are living in Christ, and living on
   Christ, do not be afraid to sing as you go home--

   "Now I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies, I bid farewell
   to every fear, And wipe my weeping eyes."

   It will be a blessing to your family for you to be happy. You may find
   that something has gone wrong while you have been away. Go home as
   happy as you can be and you will be better able to bear the cares and
   vexations that must and will befall you. Keep your spirit well worked
   up to the fear of the Lord and the enjoyment of His Presence. Then, if
   some little matter should come to disquiet you, you can say, "Who am I
   that I should he vexed and chafed, or lose my temper, or be cast down
   about such a matter as this? This is not my sphere of well-being. This
   is not my Heaven. This is not my

   God."--

   "If you should take them all away, Yet should I not repine--

   Before they were possessed by me

   They were entirely Thine.

   Nor would I speak a murmuring word,

   Though the whole world were gone,

   But seek enduring happiness

   In You, and You alone."

   But, oh, suppose you feel persuaded and honestly admit that you are not
   prepared to die, not made meet for Heaven? Do not utterly despair, but
   be grateful that you live where the Gospel is preached! "Faith comes by
   hearing, and hearing by the Word of God." Be much in hearing the Word
   and be much in earnest prayer that the hearing may be blessed to your
   soul. Above all, give diligence to that Divine Command which bids you
   trust in Jesus Christ, whom He has sent. Eternal Life lies in the
   nutshell of that one sentence, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   you shall be saved." All that is asked of you--and even that Grace
   gives you--is simply to trust in Him who, as Son of God, died for the
   sins of men! God give you that faith, and then may you meet death with
   joy, or look forward to the coming of the Lord with peace, whichever
   may be your lot. Amen.

Fine Pleading

   (No. 3539)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   SEPTEMBER 24, 1871.

   "Remember me, O Lord, with the favor that You have toward Your people;
   O visit me with Your salvation." Psalm 106:4.

   How gracious a thing it is on God's part to make prayers for us! He
   puts them into our mouths. No one need say, "I cannot pray because I am
   unable to compose a sentence." Here is a prayer already composed which
   would be suitable for the lips of anyone here present--high or low,
   rich or poor, saint or sinner! And it is a yet greater mercy that the
   God who thus gives us the form of prayer waits to give us the spirit of
   prayer, "for the Holy Spirit helps our infirmities." Whereas we know
   not what we should pray for, as we ought, He "makes intercession for
   the saints according to the will of God." When He gives you the prayer,
   and gives you the power to pray it, what a sweet blessing! But that is
   not all, for when the prayer is thus presented on earth aright, there
   waits One above, quick of ear and ready of plea, who takes the
   supplication, presents it before His Father's Throne, perfected by His
   wisdom and perfumed by His merit--and then the Father smiles and the
   prayer is answered with abundant blessings!

   My prayer tonight is that many here present may take the words of our
   text and have them laid upon their souls like burning coals--and that
   then the smoking incense of holy prayer may go up to Heaven--and the
   Lord may smell in it, through Jesus Christ, a sweet savor of rest!

   We shall regard our text tonight in three lights--first, as a suitable
   prayer for every Christian. Secondly, as a very fitting petition for
   distressed souls--I mean Christians who are desponding and have lost
   their evidences. And, thirdly, as a very suitable cry for an awakened,
   seeking sinner. My dear Brothers and Sisters in the faith, will you
   join me, then, under the first head, while we consider--

   I. HOW SUITABLE THIS PRAYER IS FOR EACH OF US WHO ARE IN CHRIST JESUS.

   You will observe that he who prays here asks for no exceptional favor
   He says, "Remember me with the favor that You have toward Your people."
   It is not an ambitious prayer that asks to be distinguished beyond the
   rest of the beloved family. It is not a discontented prayer that seeks
   to have some special blessing which shall be denied to the rest of the
   Christian brotherhood. It is a prayer for benedictions common to all
   the saints! "Remember me with the favor which You have toward Your
   people." And this is a lesson for us in our prayers. For instance,
   nature suggests to me that I should pray to be saved of all bodily
   pain--but that is not a favor which God bears towards His people. Many
   of His people here endure even excruciating pain--some in the pangs of
   martyrdom--and others through His laying His hand upon them in natural
   sickness. He never intended to keep His people from pain. He had a Son
   without sin, but He never had a Son without suffering! The Perfect One,
   the First-Born, must have hands and feet pierced and every nerve must
   become the means of fresh agony to Him. I dare not, therefore, pray,
   "Lord, keep me from all physical pain." Why should I ask to have what
   He has not given to the rest of His people? No, if there is a cup on
   the table that tastes of the bitter, and He means it for the sons, let
   me have my share--and His love with it! So, too, I have no right to ask
   God to preserve me in riches, or in a comfortable position, or to keep
   me from poverty. I may ask this, but it must always be with complete
   submission to the Divine Will, for who am I that I should not be poor?
   Better ones by far than I have been poor--much poorer than I am likely
   to be. Why am I to expect to go to Heaven by a smooth, grassy road,
   while others have had to tread the flints that cut their feet?--

   "Must I be carried to the skies

   On flowery beds of ease,

   While others fought to win the prize,

   And sailed through bloody seas?"

   To desire to escape from every form of trial is natural to us, but it
   is not a dictate of Grace that we should turn it into prayer. No, be
   content with the common lot of God's people. "Shall the disciple be
   above his Master? Shall the servant be above his Lord?" Let this
   content you, "Father, whether healthy or sick, whether rich or poor,
   whether honored or despised, extend to me the favor which You have
   toward Your people--and my greatest desires can ask no more."

   But please observe, next, that while this prayer asks for nothing more
   than the common blessing, it also is content with nothing less--

   "Extend to me that favor, Lord, You to Your people do afford."

   It is the same favor that is extended to them that is asked for, for,
   Brothers and Sisters, anything short of this will not answer our turn.
   I would desire, and I know you do, my Brethren, to have that favor from
   God which is eternal--that favor which has no beginning--that
   everlasting favor which was in the Divine Mind before the earth was.
   You want to also have immutable favor, the favor that never changes.
   Though we change, yet it abides the same. What would you do if the
   favor of God were changeable? Of what use would His love be, if that
   love could come and go--could sometimes give, and then again could take
   away? You need immutable favor! And I know you need boundless favor,
   for your needs are unlimited. You need the love of Christ that passes
   knowledge--you need it in all its heights and all its depths--you need
   the very heart of God! You need His heart of compassion. You need a
   Savior to be one with you, and yourself to be one with Him. You would
   not like to be put off with a crown. You would not like to be put off
   with an empire, or with all that earth calls good and great! You need
   no more, but you need no less than such favor as the Lord extends
   towards those whom He loves, who are the objects of His sacred choice.
   No more. No less.

   You must note, next, in the prayer what is peculiarly to be
   observed--that he who is praying in this case asks for blessings on the
   same footing as the rest of the saints. You will observe that it is on
   the footing of Grace he asks that he may have the favor which God bears
   towards His people. "Favor." If there is one saved who has been a great
   offender against God's Law--immoral, debauched, and depraved--it must
   be by favor. And, dear Christian Friend, whoever you may be, there is
   no other way in which you can be saved and you know it! When the Lord
   extends the blessings of the Covenant to gross sinners, it is clear
   that they are given to them simply because He will have mercy on whom
   He will have mercy! But to you, also, the favor comes in precisely the
   same way. I am sure you dare not ask God to deal with you on the ground
   of merit, for what are your merits, O you saints--what are your merits,
   but to merit the eternal flames? You ask the Lord that He would extend
   to you, not the dealings of His Justice, but that He would remember you
   with the compassions of His Grace! Is there any professed Christian
   here that refuses to stand on such terms as these, and come to God and
   ask for favor--for gratuitous mercy? Then, Friend, you are no child of
   God! Whatever else the children differ in, they never disagree in
   this--that "salvation is of the Lord," and is of Grace, and of Grace
   alone! Your spot is not "the spot of His children," unless you look at
   even the bread you eat and the raiment you wear as the gift of Divine
   Charity and unless you place all your hope for pardon of sin and for
   acceptance at the last, entirely upon the free, undeserved, spontaneous
   favor of the Lord your God!

   Well then, you see what we ask for is what He gives to all His
   people--no more, no less! And we ask for that, not as our due, but as a
   favor--a favor for which we will bless Him in life and bless Him in
   death, if He will but remember to grant it to us! Still looking at our
   text as the Christian's prayer, I would observe that he wishes,
   according to the text, that the same results may follow as in the case
   of all God's people, for he adds, "Visit me with Your salvation."
   Beloved, God's favor ends in salvation! And that word, "salvation," is
   a very extensive term. If you read the Psalm you will see that the
   Psalmist evidently uses it, first, in the sense of deliverance. The
   children of Israel came to the Red Sea and they were afraid that there
   they would be destroyed. But God led them through the deeps as through
   the wilderness! Well then, when I pray this prayer, "O Lord, remember
   me with the favor that You bear Your people," I mean this--"When I come
   into any trouble, I ask You to help me to go through it. As You made a
   way through the Red Sea for Your people of old, make a way for me." Oh,
   how often does God do this for us! When it seems as if the obstacles
   were almost insur-mountable--when our wit seems to have failed us and
   we can do no more--we have been ready to say, "Alas, Master, what shall
   we do?" Then our extremity has been the Divine Opportunity and through
   the depths of the sea He has led His rejoicing people! Then the word,
   salvation, is meant in the Psalm evidently to include the forgiveness
   of sins, for you remember, as we read the Psalm, how the sins of Israel
   were mentioned over and over again. But it is added, "Nevertheless,
   when they cried unto Him, He heard their prayers." So if I use this
   prayer, I am to mean just this, "Lord, You are accus-

   tomed to forgive Your people. Forgive me! You blot out their sins like
   a cloud. Blot out mine! You, moreover, help Your children to overcome
   their sins. Help me! Sanctify me, spirit, soul and body! You preserve
   Your people in temptation and bring them out of it. Gracious Shepherd,
   keep me as one of Your flock! You save your children in the hour of
   great peril, and as their day, so is their strength. Oh, Infinite
   Preserver of Your beloved, cover me with Your feathers and under Your
   wings permit me to trust You! Let Your Truth be my shield and buckler!"
   I think it is a very, very sweet prayer. "Visit me with Your salvation
   when I am on my bed, tossing to and fro, and raise me up if it is Your
   will. Visit me when I am slandered, and my name is cast out as evil,
   and cheer Your servant's heart. Visit me when I am in the deep waters
   and the depths overflow me--when I sink in deep mire where there is no
   standing. Come and prove Your saving might. Visit me when I come to
   die. When the chill floods of the last river are about me, visit me
   with Your salvation! Then deal with me as You have dealt with Your
   saints whenever they have passed through the Valley of the Shadow of
   Death. May Your rod and Your staff comfort me. Visit me with Your
   salvation." I suggest, Christian Brothers and Sisters, that this prayer
   will do for you living, and will do for you dying! It is a suitable
   prayer for the morning and for the evening, for the young and for the
   old, for days of joy and days of distress. Blessed prayer, let it be
   often on your lips!

   Only one more remark we will make upon it in reference to the
   Christian. You observe that all through it is a personal prayer. Our
   prayers must not always be personal. Our Savior has taught us not to
   say, "My Father," but "OurFa-ther which are in Heaven." Yet, for all
   that, he who never prays for himself in the singular never prayed
   aright for others in the plural. If you have never said, "Lord,
   remember me," you have not got so far as the thief on the cross. You
   are not qualified at all to go as far as Abraham on the plains of
   Mamre, when he interceded for others. He that has the largest heart
   must see to it that his own personal salvation is secure. So, dear
   Friend, professing Christian, let me ask you to take the prayer in the
   first person singular, and say, "Lord, remember me with the favor which
   You bear to Your chosen." I pray it. If You call me, Lord, to minister
   to this great people, as my day is, so may my strength be. As You have
   dealt with others of Your servants in a like position, deal so with me.
   Elders and deacons, with your responsibility upon you, pray that the
   God of Stephen and the God of Philip will be with you and extend to you
   the favor which He gave to Elders and deacons of old! Mothers, fathers,
   ask for the Grace that He gives to Christian parents. Children,
   servants, ask for the Grace that He has been known to give to those in
   your position. You who are rich, pray often that you may not miss the
   Divine Favor, for these things are often dangerous. You that are poor,
   pray that you may have this to sweeten all--to make your little to be
   enough! You that are in health, pray this lest the vigor of your body
   be the weakness of your soul. And you upon whose cheek there is the
   hectic flush of consumption--you that are weak and near departure--you
   have already got your death-song ready. Here it is--"Lord, remember me!
   Remember me, O Lord, with the favor which You have given Your people! O
   visit me with Your salvation!" I leave that prayer with every Christian
   heart, here, and ask that it may be engraved there by the Holy Spirit.
   This prayer is also--

   II. A FITTING PRAYER FOR DEPRESSED, DESPONDING SOULS.

   They are God's people and we give to them, now, this prayer, and we
   trust that as they pray it they may have "the oil of joy given them for
   mourning, and the garment of praise, instead of the spirit of
   heaviness." I ask them to look very briefly, but with all their eyes,
   at this prayer. You will note that here is a case in which a good man
   may seem to be forgotten. It is a good man that wrote this Psalm--an
   Inspired man, and yet he says, "Remember me, O Lord." Did he think
   himself forgotten? He feared he was. There have been others of God's
   saints who have endured this fear. Yes, a whole Church has sometimes
   labored under it. Zion said, "My God has forsaken me. My God has
   forgotten me." Thus you may be, as you think, forgotten--and yet you
   may be very dear to God--as dear as you ever were!

   Notice, next, that when you, child of God, come into this condition,
   the very best prayer you can pray is a sinner's prayer. Why do I call
   this a sinner's prayer? Why, because it so reminds me of the dying
   thief. "Lord, remember me," was such a suitable prayer for him. Oh,
   child of God, if you doubt your own salvation, do not dispute about it,
   but go as a sinner! Use a sinner's prayer! Begin where the dying thief
   began with, "Lord, remember me." I would recommend to every Christian
   who is in the dark and has lost his evidences, to go at once by the old
   track that sinners have trodden so long. "I will go to Jesus, though my
   sin does, like a mountain, rise. I know His courts. I will enter in."
   Go to Him! Go even now!

   And you will observe, too, that for a desponding soul it is good to
   remember that everything it can obtain in the future by God must be by
   favor. "Remember me, O Lord, with the favor." I dwelt on this when
   speaking to the child of God in the light, but it is even more
   important that we should dwell on this when speaking to the child of
   God in the

   dark, for the danger is when you are desponding to begin to become
   legal. Your own conscience and Satan together will be setting you upon
   legal methods of getting comfort. They are all fruitless! Go on the
   track of Grace. Free Grace is what you need, and nothing else will suit
   you. Cry, "Lord, remember me with Your favor! Give me what You could
   not give me as a mere matter of justice! Deal with me as you could not
   deal with me if You did see me in myself as guilty before You! Deal
   favorably with Your servant. Have a favor towards me, for this alone
   can restore me."

   And then, next, it is good for a person who is in distress to remember
   that God's favor towards His own people does not change, for evidently
   this good man, though he asked God to remember him, had not any doubt
   whatever that God had a favor towards His own people! Nothing like
   being sound in Doctrine to help you towards comfort. If a man shall
   doubt the Perseverance of the Saints, and believe that God will cast
   away His people, I really do not see what he has to do when he is
   brought into distress of mind. But if he still holds to this, "Truly
   the Lord is good to Israel--to such as are of a clean heart. As for me,
   He may have forgotten me. I fear I am not one of His, but I know He
   would not forget His own"--why, then the fact of the Immutability of
   God towards His people becomes, as it were, as an argument, and we come
   before the Lord with better heart and greater hope, and say, "Lord,
   since You never change towards them, introduce me into their number and
   let Your eternal love pour forth itself on my poor, broken,
   disconsolate spirit. Remember me--poor, fallen, backsliding me--with
   the favor, the free Grace which You have towards Your people." It is
   well to hold to the Truth of God, for it may serve us like an anchor in
   the day of storm!

   Once again. Let me speak to the depressed, and remind them that the
   prayer is instructive, for it shows that all that is needed for a
   forsaken, forgotten spirit is that God should visit it again. "Remember
   me, O Lord. Anybody else's remembering can do me no good, but if You
   only give one thought toward Your servant, it is all done! Lord, I have
   been visited by the pastor, and he tried to cheer me. I have had a
   visit in the preaching of the Gospel in the morning and the evening of
   Your Day. I went to Your Table and I did not get encouragement even
   there. But, Lord, You visit me!" A visit from Christ is the cure for
   all spiritual diseases! I have frequently reminded you of that in the
   address to the Church at Laodi-cea. The Church at Laodicea was neither
   cold nor hot, and Christ said that He would spew it out of His
   mouth--but do you know how He speaks of it? As if He would cure it!
   "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hears My voice and
   opens the door, I will come in and sup with him, and he with Me." That
   is not an address to sinners. It is sometimes used so, but it is torn
   out of its context. It is evidently an address to a Church of God, or a
   child of God who has lost the Presence and the Light of God's
   Countenance! All you need is a visit from Christ. All you need is that
   once again your communion should be restored--and I do bless the Lord
   that He can do that in a moment! He can make your soul, "before it is
   aware, like the chariots of Amminadib." You may have come here tonight
   about as dead in soul as you could be, but the flashes of Eternal Life
   can reach you and kindle a soul within--within the ribs of your old
   dead nature--once again! You may have felt as if it were all over and
   the last spark of Grace had gone out. But when the Lord visits His
   people, He makes the wilderness and the solitary place to rejoice and
   the desert to blossom as the rose! I pray it may be such a happy hour
   to you that the prayer may be fulfilled, "Visit me with Your
   salvation." I have great sympathy with those who are cast down. May
   God, the Comfort of those who are cast down, comfort you! May He bring
   you out who are bound with chains! And you solitary ones, may He set
   you in families! And I do not know a wiser method for you to pursue
   than incessantly to cry unto Him and let this be the prayer, "Remember
   me--me--with the favor which You have toward Your people. O visit me
   with Your salvation." And now our last point. This is-- III. A VERY
   PROPER PRAYER FOR THE AWAKENED, BUT UNFORGIVEN SINNER. There are some
   in this house of that character. I know there are unforgiven sinners
   here. I only hope that some of them are awakened to know the danger of
   their state. If they are, may God help them to pray this prayer,
   because, first, it is a humble prayer. "Lord, remember me"--as much as
   to say, "Lord, give one thought to me. I am a poor miserable sinner. I
   am not worth much thought, but, Lord, do at least remember me. Pass me
   not, O Healer of sin-sick souls! Pass me not. Hear my cry! Answer my
   anguish! Regard the desires of my soul. Remember me!" It is an earnest
   prayer, too. No doubt it was earnest as this Inspired man prayed it. It
   breathes life as you read it. Oh, dear Heart, if you need a Savior, be
   in earnest for Him! If you can take "no," for an answer, you shall have
   "no," for an answer, but if it comes to this-- "Give me Christ, or else
   I die!--I must have mercy!"--you shall have it! When you will have it,
   you shall have it. When God stirs you up to agonize for a blessing, the
   blessing shall not delay. Note that this prayer, which I can recommend
   to you, is not only humble and earnest, but it is a prayer directed in
   the right way. It is to God alone. "Remember me, O Lord. Visit me, O
   lord, with Your salvation." All our help lies yonder. There is none
   here. There is none in any man. No

   priest can help you--no friend nor minister. When you apply to us we
   might say what the King of Israel said to the woman in Samaria, when it
   was shut up with siege, "If the Lord does not help you, from where
   shall I help you? Out of the winepress, or from the barn floor?" There
   is nothing we can do! "Vain is the help of man!" Turn your eyes to God
   alone--to the Cross where Christ suffered. Look there, and there, only,
   and be this your prayer, "Lord, remember me!" When the thief was dying,
   he did not say, "John, pray for me." John was there. He did not look on
   the mother of Christ and say, "Holy Virgin, pray for me." He might have
   said it. He did not turn to any of the Apostles, or the holy company
   that were around the Cross. He knew which way to look and, turning his
   dying eyes to Him who suffered on the center Cross, he had no prayer
   but this, "Lord, remember me." 'Tis all you need! Pray to God, and God
   alone, for from Him, alone, must mercy come to you!

   Observe, again, O Sinner, if you would use this prayer, that it is a
   personal prayer for you. "Lord, remember me." Oh, if we could get men
   to think of themselves, half the battle would be over! Who are you? Who
   are you? I would put this prayer into your mouth, whoever you may be,
   "Lord, I have been a Sabbath-Breaker this day. All the early part of it
   was spent as it ought not to be. But, Lord, remember me." "O God, I
   have been a drunkard. I have broken all the laws of sobriety--have even
   blasphemed Your name. But Lord, remember me!" Is there one here into
   whose mouth I might put such words as these, "Lord, I stand trembling
   before You, for I am a woman that is a sinner. Lord, remember me! Call
   on me with the favor that You have toward Your people. As you did look
   on the woman of Samaria, so look on me"? Is there one here that has
   been a thief--almost ashamed to have the word mentioned, lest those who
   sit near should look at you? Well, this is peculiarly the thief's
   prayer, "Lord, remember me." How I wish I could come round now! I would
   not know who you were, but, oh, if I could, I would put this right into
   your heart, "Lord, remember me!" Up in the back gallery, where you can
   hardly hear, and cannot see, it is a good place to pray in--a capital
   place, there hidden away in the corner, to breathe the cry, "O God,
   remember me!"

   Another thing about this prayer is that it is a Gospel prayer. It says,
   "Remember me with Your favor." Everything a sinner gets must come by
   favor. It cannot come anyway else, for if you get what you deserve, you
   will get no love, no mercy, no Grace. Oh, Sinner, do come to God on the
   footing of favor and say, "For Your name's sake, and for Your mercy's
   sake, have pity upon poor undeserving me." It is a Gospel prayer.

   Once again. It seems to me to be an argumentative prayer "Where is the
   argument?" you ask. Why, here, "You have had favor towards Your people,
   Lord, have favor towards me." It is always an argument for a man to do
   a kindness to you if he has done a kindness to others. We generally
   say, if we are very poor, "Such a one has been helping poor people like
   me." There is a sort of implied argument that he will help you, being
   in the same case. Can you see it? There are the gates of Heaven. Can
   you bear the luster of those massive pearls? I want you not to look at
   them, however. Do you see them? Do you see them who are streaming
   through in long lines? They go through like a mighty river! There are
   hundreds, there are thousands, there are tens of thousands of them! Who
   are they? Who are they? They are, all of them, sinners--just such as I
   am, dear Friend--just such as you are! They are all clothed in white,
   now, but their robes were once all black. Ask them, and you will hear
   them say they washed their robes and made them white in the blood of
   the Lamb. Ask all of them how it is they passed so happily through that
   pearly gate into the golden streets of the city, and they will all tell
   you, with united breath--

   "Ascribe salvation to the Lamb, Redemption to His death."

   Oh, I will even creep in that way! Ah, through the sinners' Savior I
   hope to find a passage to the sinners' Heaven, where sinners washed
   white dwell forever! There is an argument in the prayer. I hope you
   will have skill to use it till you prevail.

   Once again, I commend this prayer to the awakened sinner because it is
   a prayer for a helpless soul, for it says, Oh, "visitme with Your
   salvation." There are patients in London who would be very glad to be
   received into a hospital. They would be glad if they could be carried
   tomorrow morning into some one of those noble institutions, there to be
   cared for. But there are people worse off than they are, for there are
   some that could not be carried to a hospital, for they would die on the
   road! If they are ever to be healed at all, they are in such a bad case
   that the doctor must come to them. Oh, and that is a sinner's case,
   too, and some feel it! And, therefore, the prayer, "Visit me with Your
   salvation." "Here, Lord, I lie before You, so ruined by my sin that I
   can scarcely turn even an eye to the Cross, I am so blind. 'Tis true
   Your Grace can save, but my hand is paralyzed, and I cannot grasp Your
   Grace! 'Tis true Your love can penetrate my heart,

   but, ah, my heart feels so hard, how can Your love get into it? O
   Savior, You must do all for me, for mine is a desperate case!"

   Such cases Christ loves. He came to seek and save--not the half-lost,
   but the lost! Commit your desperate case into His hands, who has saved
   desperate sinners thousands of times, and will save them yet! I do pray
   that before you rest tonight--before you go to your bed and dare close
   your eyes--this may be your heart's prayer, "O Lord, remember me with
   the favor which You have toward Your people. Visit me with Your
   salvation."

   I can do no more than leave it in the hands of the Eternal Spirit. May
   He bless the Word, for Christ Jesus' sake. Amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: PSALM 116:10-19; SONG OF SOLOMON 2:1-7.

   PSALM 116:10-19.

   The whole Psalm is one of joyous thanksgiving because of God's mercy to
   the singer. He had been in deep waters of trial and affliction, but had
   not been allowed to sink. He had known fierce assaults of sin that
   threatened tearful eyes and falling, stumbling stops, but God had
   upheld and strengthened him. As he recalls all this, he longs to make
   some return by way of praise and witness to others. Hence he now
   inquires.

   Verses 10, 11. I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly
   afflicted: Isaid in my haste, All men are liars. And uncommonly near
   the truth he came, even though he was in a hurry in saying it, for if
   you trust in any men, they will be liars to you. They will fail you,
   either from lack of faithfulness, or else from lack of power. There are
   pinches where the kindest hand cannot succor. There are times of sorrow
   when she who is the partner of your bosom cannot find you alleviation.
   Then you will have to come to God, and God alone--and you will never
   find Him fail you! The brooks of the earth are dry in summer and frozen
   in winter. All my fresh springs are in You, my God, and there neither
   frost nor drought can come. Happy man who has got right away from
   everything to his God!

   12. What shalIrender unto the LORD for allHis benefits towards me?Here
   we see gratitude is springing up in this man's breast. He lives upon
   God and he loves God, and now the question comes, "What shall I do for
   God?" Service is not first. We make a mistake when we begin with that.
   No, we begin as he did, with, "I love the Lord." Tell what the Lord has
   done for you and then go on to, "What shall I render to the Lord for
   all His benefits toward me?"

   13-15. I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the
   LORD. I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all His
   people. Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.
   We do well to notice those deaths, for God notices them. They are among
   His precious things. And if God thinks so much of dying saints, depend
   upon it, He will not forget the living ones! He will help us. He will
   help us to the end.

   16. O LORD, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, and the son of
   Your handmaid. You haveloosed my bonds. What a sweet thing to be the
   servant of God! Well does David say it twice over. Well does he delight
   to look upon himself as a slave that was born in his Master's house.
   "My mother," he says, "was one of Your servants. I am the son of Your
   handmaid." Oh, it is a blessed thing to be able to be God's every
   way--to feel, in looking back, "I am not only His by redemption and by
   the new birth, but I seem as if I was bound to be His by a long
   ancestry of men and women whom His Sovereign Grace called to Himself."
   Grace does not run in the blood, but it is a great mercy when it runs
   side by side with it--and when the handmaiden of the Lord is mother of
   a man who is a child of God as well as her child! "You have loosed my
   bonds." You are never quite free--you have never got your bonds all
   loosed--till you can doubly feel the bonds of God. Read that--"I am
   Your servant. I am Your servant." That is two blows. "You have loosed
   my bonds." There is no freedom except in perfect subjection to the will
   of God! When every thought is brought into captivity to the mind of
   God, then every thought is free. You have heard much of the freedom of
   the will. There is no freedom of the will till Grace has bound the will
   in fetters of Divine Affection! Then is it free, and not till then. "I
   am Your servant--Your servant. You have loosed my bonds."

   17. I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call
   upon the name of the LORD. He has been doing it. What a man has done he
   will do. Oh, it is a blessed thing that the children of God at last
   catch a habit of devotion. Just as the sinner continues in his sin, so
   may I venture to say, "Shall the Ethiopian change his skin, or the
   leopard his spots?" If

   so, then he that has once heartily learned to praise his God may begin
   to forget to do so! Use is second nature, and the holy use to which God
   has put us, by His Grace, shall be our nature forever!

   18, 19.1 will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence ofall His
   people. In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of you, O
   Jerusalem. Praise you the LORD. I see that David liked company. He
   would have been happy here, though we meet under conditions not wholly
   pleasant. He would have been glad to be in the midst of a smiling
   company of grateful saints who could all say, "That is true, David.
   What you have written of yourself, you might have written of each one
   of us. And we can each one say, 'I love the Lord because He has heard
   my voice and my supplications.'"

   SONG OF SOLOMON 2:1-7.

   We believe that this song sets forth the mutual love of Christ and His
   believing people. It is a book of deep mystery, not to be understood
   except by the initiated. But those who have learned a life of sacred
   fellowship with Jesus will bear witness that when they desire to
   express what they feel, they are compelled to borrow expressions from
   this matchless Song! Samuel Rutherford, in his famous letters, when he
   spoke of the love of Christ as shed abroad in his heart, perhaps was
   scarcely conscious that he continually reproduced the expressions of
   the Song, but so it is. They were naturally fresh enough from him, but
   they came from this wonderful Book. It stands in the middle of the
   Bible. It is the Holy of Holies--the central point of all. Thus He
   speaks--the glorious "greater than Solomon."

   Verses 1, 2. I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys. As
   the lily among thorns, so is My love among the daughters. So does
   Christ's Church spring up singular for her beauty--as much different
   from the world--as much superior thereto as the lily to the thorns. Now
   see how she responds and answers to him.

   3. As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved
   among the sons. I sat down under His shadow with great delight, and his
   fruit was sweet to my taste. To Him there is none like she--to her
   there is none like He. Jesus values His people. He paid His heart's
   blood for their redemption and, "unto you that believe, He is
   precious." No mention shall be made of coral or of rubies in comparison
   with Him. Nothing can equal Him. There are other trees in the woods,
   but He is the lone one bearing fruit--the citron tree, whose golden
   apples are delicious to our taste. Let us come up and pluck from His
   loaded branches this very night!

   4. He brought me to the banqueting house, and His banner over me was
   love. You and I know what this means--at least, many here do. You know
   how delightful it is to feel that it is not now the banner of war, but
   the banner of love that waves above your head, for all is peace between
   you and your God! And now you are not brought to the prison or to the
   place of labor, but to the banqueting house. Act worthily of the
   position which you occupy! If you are in a banqueting house, take care
   to feast.

   5. Refresh me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am sick of
   love. Oh, that I knew Him better! Oh, that I loved Him more! Oh, that I
   were more like He! Oh, that I were with Him! "I am sick of love."

   6. 7. His left hand is under my head, and His right hand embraces me. I
   charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds
   of the field, that you stir not up, nor awake my love till He please.
   If He is with me, may nothing disturb Him--nothing cause Him to
   withdraw Himself. Our Lord Jesus is very jealous, and when He manifests
   Himself to His people, a very little thing will drive Him away like the
   hinds and the roes that are very timid--so communion is a very delicate
   and dainty thing. It is soon broken. Oh, may God grant tonight that
   nothing may happen to the thoughts of any of you by which your
   fellowship with Christ should be destroyed!

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON LORD'S-DAY EVENING, APRIL
   21, 1872.

   "And for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush." Deuteronomy
   33:16.

   MOSES died blessing the people. This showed his meekness, for they had
   been his plague all his life, and yet his last word with them is full
   of blessing. He has a blessing for all the tribes, though all the
   tribes had in turn grieved his spirit. It is a graceful thing to die
   scattering benedictions--for the old man to feel that life is just
   about over, and that before he dies he will distribute his
   legacies--legacies of benediction. It is the most graceful way of
   departing out of this life to another, leaving a blessing behind, while
   we, ourselves, are going into the fullness of the blessing to come. But
   the blessing of Moses was graceful at the close of his life because it
   was constant with all of his life that went before. Had he lived
   cursing, it would have been absurd, if not impious, to die blessing. I
   would not wish to have that man's benediction in words on his deathbed
   who never gave a benediction in actions while he was in his life. But
   the whole course of Moses' life was that of blessing the people. He had
   been a nursing father to them. He carried them in his bosom. Often he
   stood in the gap between them and an angry God. He had spared them by
   acting as a Mediator when the sword of vengeance was drawn against
   them. Countless blessings had been bestowed upon them through him. Was
   it not his rod that worked wonders in the field of Zoan? Was it not his
   hand which was stretched over the Red Sea, by which God made a way for
   his people? Did not his rod, when it smote the rock, bring forth the
   liquid stream? Was it not by his voice that God communicated to them
   that the manna should drop around their camps? He had blessed them from
   the very first moment that he had come into contact with them, for he
   came forth from the palace of Pharaoh, giving up all the riches that
   might have been his, that he might side with his brethren and began to
   fight their battles, smiting the Egyptian and hiding his body in the
   sand. It was from this cause that he was banished from the courts and
   when he returned, again, it was with the same resolute determination to
   abide with his people, and the same warm heart towards them. Brothers
   and Sisters, if you wish to give your children a blessing when you die,
   be a blessing to them while you live! If you would make your last words
   worth the hearing, let your whole life be worth the seeing. It is
   graceful to die blessing, but let it be always consistent with the
   blessedness of our former life.

   The particular blessing which he gave to Joseph shall now have our
   attention and, first, we shall notice the blessing, itself, which he
   wished to Joseph. And, secondly, the peculiar form in which he worded
   it And, when we have thought that over, it shall be in our heart to
   wish the same to all who are present here. First, then, let us look
   at--

   I. THE GREAT BLESSING WHICH MOSES WISHED CONFERRED UPON JOSEPH.

   The good will of God--"the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush." I
   would like any man's good will. The better the man is, the more I would
   desire to have his good will. If it did not come to the benefacitor the
   good doing, I would like him to think benevolently towards me, to have
   his good will, if I never derived any particular good directly from
   him. One does not like to go to bed and feel you have an ill will from
   any man. Certainly, it is always well to feel that we have no ill will,
   ourselves, towards any, but that our good will reaches out to all! One
   would like to have the good will of wise men who could counsel us, and
   of great men who could help us. One would like to have the good will of
   angels, to know that they cheerfully obey the Divine Command to watch
   over us. But how much superior to all this is the good will of God--the
   good will of Him whose will is power, whose wish is fact, who has but
   to will it and the good that is willed becomes our good in very deed!
   Oh, 'tis a high blessing to have the good will of God! Beloved, our
   heart wishes this to

   everyone here present, and every Christian wishes this for their
   children, wishes it for their household, wishes it for their neighbor,
   wishes it for their fellow countrymen. May the good will of God be with
   you!

   For, Beloved, in the first place, this is the fountain of every
   blessing. It is from the good will of God that every good thing which
   comes to us takes its rise. Election is according to the pleasure of
   His good will. He chose us because He would choose us--because He had a
   good will towards us. Redemption springs from that good will. What else
   but good will could give the Savior to such unworthy ones as we were?
   Our calling into the Divine Life is a work of His good will! Our
   preservation in that life, our growth in it and all the blessings with
   which God loads that life to make it blessed--all these are fruits of
   His good will! You cannot find a single blessing that comes to us by
   the way of merit. We may say of every blessing, it is according to His
   loving kindness and His tender mercies. He forgave us because He had a
   good will towards us. He restored us from our wanderings because of His
   good will. He daily cleanses us and He makes us meet for the
   inheritance of the saints in light--and all because of His good will.
   To what else can we ascribe the Covenant of Grace? To what else can all
   the blessings which are pledged to us by that Covenant be attributed?
   It is according to His good will. In wishing, therefore, to anyone that
   he may have the good will of God that dwelt in the bush, you are
   wishing to him the fountainhead of all mercies--you are wishing to him
   the infinity, the immensity, the Immutability of the goodness and love
   of God! It is a comprehensive blessing--and who is able to tell all its
   heights and depths?

   The good will of God is also the sweetener of all other blessings. It
   is the source of them! It is the sweetener of them. Everything that
   comes from God to us derives a double blessedness when we feel that
   they are the fruit of His good will. Take spiritual mercies--though
   they are, in themselves, so rich that none can estimate their value,
   yet is there a peculiar brightness put upon them when we know these
   come from God's love! These are all tokens of His favor towards us, His
   people. And truly, Brothers and Sisters, the lower mercies of daily
   life become more blessed to us as we know they come from His good will!
   As you cut that loaf of bread, each slice of it is flavored with His
   good will. When you put on your garments tomorrow morning, though they
   are those in which you exercise your toilsome labors, yet are they
   tokens of God's good will as much as those coats of skins which God
   gave to our first parents! Yes, Beloved, sitting here tonight, this air
   we breathe, the power to breathe it and the health which enabled us to
   come up to the House of Prayer, and this House, itself, and the ears
   with which we hear the words, and the good tidings which are given us
   to hear--all these are of His good will, and are the sweeter because we
   recognize the favor of God in them!

   Oh, to have temporal blessings with a curse--that is a dreadful thing!
   I hardly know a text more fearful to contemplate than that one, "I will
   curse your blessings." Oh, if God makes any bitter, how bitter the
   wormwood and the gall must be! If He puts death in the pot in which the
   broth is made to sustain life, what death must there be when He shall
   deal out the poisoned cup of His eternal wrath to the ungodly! Sweet,
   indeed, are blessings when they are thus honeyed with His love, but
   would they be if, instead thereof, they were seasoned and salted with
   His wrath? Be thankful, Christian, for I will venture to say that this
   makes even our trials pleasant to us when we know that they also are
   the fruits of His good will! We cannot always make our hearts believe
   that the rod is a good thing. We cannot always persuade our unbelief
   that our dark, heavy, gloomy hours are really for our good--but they
   are so--and we shall believe this when we perceive that they are sent
   out of good will to us! Not out of anger, but out of love--love to us
   that He may love us right up out of our sins, love us away from our
   infirmities and love us into a higher state of Grace--attracting us by
   His Divine Love till we become like He! Note, then, the two things--it
   is a great blessing because it is the source of all blessings, and the
   sweetener of all blessings!

   But the next consideration about this is--and let us carefully notice
   it--that, nevertheless, it surpasses all other blessings. The good will
   of Him that dwelt in the bush is a greater blessing than all the
   blessings in the world--what if I say in Heaven, itself? Besides,
   Brothers and Sisters, all the blessings in the world without this are
   less than nothing! And if they were all gone, if that were conceivable,
   and yet we had this left to us, we need not regret the loss of all,
   since we should find all in God! You remember how the old Puritan put
   it? He had been rich and then was brought to poverty, and he said he
   didn't find much difference, for, he said, when he was rich, he found
   God in all, and now that he was poor, he found all in God! Perhaps the
   latter is the higher state of the two. Without God, alas, my Soul, if
   you were in Paradise! But with God, oh, joy and bliss if you were in
   prison! All the things put together shall perish in the using--like
   leaves of the forest, they shall wither before long. But You, my God,
   are an unwithering Tree of Life, and under You I

   shall always have shade--I shall sit down beneath Your shadow with
   great delight, and shall always have food, for Your fruit is sweet unto
   my taste. I will rejoice in You, for Your good will is better than all
   things!

   I will tell you what it is--you who have not this good will. If you
   should lose everything else and you have to win it, you would make a
   good bargain. If you have not God's good will and could not have it
   except by losing the sight of your eyes, and the hearing of your ears,
   and the renouncing of all your bodily and mental faculties--if you
   could not have the good will of God without losing house, home and
   friends, you might cheerfully, gladly, at once close in with the
   negotiation and say, "Let me have God's good will and I will take
   whatever He pleases, or lose whatever He takes!" But let me remind you
   that you have not to lose these things to get His good will. If you
   have His good will, you may know it by this--will you accept the gift
   which He presents to you in His dear Son? Having nothing, will you take
   Christ to be yours? Being naked, and poor, and miserable, will you let
   Him be your raiment and your riches? If so, You have God's will, you
   have God's good will, for you have Christ, who is the good will of God
   towards us, Incarnated in the flesh. The Lord grant each one of us,
   then, this blessing--to have His good will. And now, secondly-- II.
   THIS BLESSING IS PUT IN A VERY PECULIAR FORM.

   He says, "The good will of Him that dwelt in the bush." And why did he
   put it so? Was it, first, because Moses looked back to the appearance
   of God in the bush with peculiar delight on account of its being the
   first manifestation of God to his soul? I have no doubt that Moses had
   fellowship with God, before, but we do not read that he ever had an
   appearance of the Divine Being to him until he was at the back side of
   the desert near to Horeb. And there he saw God in the burning bush.
   Beloved, we always set most store--at least I do--in our memory upon
   the first appearance of God to us. It brings the tears to my eyes when
   I recollect those words of the old hymn--

   "Do mind the place, the spot of ground, Where you did meet Jesus!"

   Ah, I do mind it, and always shall, while memory holds her seat! I may
   forget anything else, but I shall never forget that! And though I have
   had many, many manifestations to the comfort of my heart, yet that
   first one has peculiar charms. And I do not marvel that Moses called
   his God, The God Who Dwelt in the Bush. Now, have not some of you
   remembrances of the first days when the love of your espousals was warm
   in you, and when the manifestations of Jesus were bright to you? Well
   then, wish to others that the good will of God, who appeared to you
   behind the hedge, or out in the field, or down in the saw pit, or at
   your bedside in your chamber--the good will of Him that said to you, "I
   have blotted out your sins like a cloud"--wish that that good will may
   rest upon your kinsfolk and your friends!

   Is it not also very likely that Moses mentioned that peculiar
   circumstance in his blessing because God on that occasion pledged
   Himself to him?He gave that burning bush to be a token to Moses, and a
   sign. And that token had been redeemed--and that good old man, at the
   end of the last 40 years of his life, remembered how God had appeared
   to him when he was 80 years of age and given him that pledge! And now
   that he was 120 years old, God had redeemed it! He had been true to him
   for 40 years. Have not we some pledges and tokens? Have not you some
   place where the Lord appeared to you and said, "Certainly, I will be
   with you, and will bring you again unto this place"? Are there no
   remembrances in your soul in which a faithful God has pledged His
   promise to you, and has redeemed it? If so, each man will know his own
   case, and each man, if he speaks naturally, will wish a blessing for
   others, according to his own experience of the blessed God! I do not
   wonder that after Moses had seen God redeem the token of the burning
   bush, when he wished to convey the idea that the good will of a
   faithful Covenant-keeping God should rest upon His servant Joseph--the
   tribe thereof-- should say, "The good will of Him that dwelt in the
   bush."

   Moreover, at that time, in the bush God did show Himself as a Covenant
   God. He began thus, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and
   the God of Jacob." He was a Covenant God. Brothers and Sisters, may you
   have the good will of a Covenant God! I often wonder what those do who
   do not know the Covenant of Grace. It seems to me to be the richest
   well of consolation that God has ever dug--the Covenant ordered in all
   things and sure. It was the stay of David on his deathbed. It is the
   comfort of many of God's Davids in the battle of life. I wish tonight
   with all my heart, dear Friends, that you may not look for the good
   will of an absolute God out of Christ, but look for and enjoy the will
   of God who has pledged Himself to you in your Representative, Christ
   Jesus, in the Eternal Covenant of His Love. I think that is another
   reason why Moses put it in that form.

   And, perhaps Moses looked upon that bush as the place of His call to a
   more active life, and regarded God in a different light from that time
   forth from what he had ever regarded Him before. His own name was
   Moses. He was drawn out of the water and now he might have changed his
   name, for God had called him out of the fire! Now he saw the God of
   fire. Oh, there are some Believers that have never got to this. They, I
   hope, have renounced the world as Moses did when he counted the
   reproach of Christ greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt! They
   have also got into the wilderness where Moses was--they are separated,
   they love contemplation and they live near to God--but they have never
   been called into active service. That third 40 years of Moses' life was
   the crowning part of all his career. The 40 years with Pharaoh, the 40
   years in the desert, all prepared him for the 40 years in the
   wilderness with his people. But some Christians have not begun that
   last period of their lives! I wish they had, and I shall be glad and
   rejoice if, tonight, the Lord should appear to any of His servants and
   call them, saying, "I have called you to bring sinners out of Egypt,
   and to set them free." If He ever does, when you come in later times to
   pronounce a blessing upon others, you will put it thus, "The God that
   called me to preach the Gospel, the God that led me as His servant, be
   with you, each one of you!" And if that is the form in which you put
   the blessing, it will be a very rich one!

   But now I will come back to the words again. What did Moses mean? We
   see why he used the term, but what did he mean by saying, "The good
   will of Him that dwelt in the bush be with you"? Did not he mean,
   first, "May the blessings of condescension ennoble you"? What
   condescension for God to dwell in a bush! Had the Eternal dwelt in a
   cedar, it would have been a stoop, but for Him to dwell in the
   uncouth-shaped, worthless shrub--a bush--oh, this was matchless! Oh,
   Beloved, may everyone of us know what it is for God to condescend to
   dwell with us! We are as the bushes of the heath. There is nothing in
   us that fits us for God's mercy. What are we, and what is our father's
   house? Why should the Lord look upon us--perhaps as little in talent as
   we are in merit, low in our own esteem--but much more low in very deed
   and truth? Oh, may the Lord deal with each one of you in His
   condescending way! He is known to give His mercy condescendingly. "He
   has put down the mighty from their seat and He has exalted them of low
   degree. He has filled the hungry with good things, but the rich He has
   sent away empty." After that fashion may He deal with you! And if He
   should do so, then how ennobled will you be, for that bush in Horeb had
   a greater Glory about it than the cedars of Lebanon! It was but a bush,
   but it was a bush in which God had dwelt! And you, too--you will have
   to say, "Your gentleness has made me great. He has lifted the poor from
   the dunghill and set him among princes, even the princes of His
   people." A drop of Grace gives more honor than a world of fame. One
   spark of love of Christ is more ennobling to your heart into which it
   falls than though it were all ablaze with the stars and orders of all
   the knighthoods of the kingdom! The love of God makes poor men truly
   rich, little men supremely great, the despised to be honorable and the
   nothing to be lifted up among the mighty! I wish you, then, Beloved,
   God's condescending love to ennoble you--"the good will of Him that
   dwelt in the bush." Or, as we might read it, "the good will of the
   Shekinah of the bush," for that is the very same Shekinah that shone
   between the cherub wings! The good will of Him that dwells upon the
   Throne in Heaven is the good will of Him that dwells in humble and
   contrite hearts today!

   But Moses, however, meant something more than that. Did not he mean
   that he wished to Joseph's tribe indwelling and mysterious
   mercies--"the good will of Him that dwelt--dwelt in the bush"? It was a
   strange dwelling. Can anyone understand how God, who is everywhere, can
   be in one place in particular? And shall anyone tell us how He, who is
   greater than all space, should yet dwell in a bush--in a bush? He that
   sets the heavens on a blaze with lightning and kindles all the stars,
   comes down and sets a bush aglow with His Divine Presence! It is
   mysterious. Oh, may everyone of us know the mysterious good will of the
   indwelling Spirit of God! Do you know it? Do you know it? Oh, Beloved,
   as the fire was in the bush, is the Spirit in you? Do you know He is
   there? Search yourselves! If He is there, may He tell you-- and if He
   is not there, oh, may some sparks of that Divine Fire fall into your
   nature now--enough, at least, to make you desire more and set you
   longing and praying for the wondrous blessing of an indwelling Spirit!
   Ignatius of old used to call himself, "Theophorus," or, "the
   God-Bearer." Truly, every Christian is such a God-Bearer. "I will dwell
   in them and walk in them." "I will put My Spirit within you, and you
   shall walk in My way." Surely Moses meant that--at least, the sense is
   in his words. May you enjoy the mysterious indwelling and the blessings
   that come from it!

   Further, did not the man of God mean that he desired that Joseph might
   possess enlightening blessings "The good will of Him that dwelt in the
   bush" means this--He set the bush alight and it became a luminary. It
   had light. It gave forth light. It had light more abundantly. It was a
   dark bush--God came into it and it caught the attention of Moses,

   though it seems to have been daylight. He was watching his flock, but
   so bright was this that it outshone the sun! And Moses said, "I will
   turn aside and see this great sight." A bush is not a great sight--it
   was God that made the bush so bright that it became a great sight! May
   you, Beloved, have the light of God's Spirit to reveal to you God's
   Truth! And may that light be in you so brightly that others may see it
   and learn God's Truth through you! What is the Scripture to us, unless
   God shines on it? The Bible is only like a country signpost at the
   turning of a road in a dark night. Unless there is the Light of God to
   read it by, the signpost is of no service. We need the Spirit of God to
   shine on the Scriptures! O God, come into us and give us Your Light! We
   need You. Let this be a token of Your good will to us.

   But that is not all. Surely Moses meant, "May the Lord grant you the
   blessings of trial and the blessings of preservation." For all through
   the various branches and twigs of that bush, there went a fire, a
   devouring fire, a fire that would have licked it up as the blaze licks
   up the stubble in a single moment! Yet that fire in its nature was
   preserving, as well as consuming and, through the goodness of God, the
   bush was as safe when it was ablaze as it had been before. Beloved, how
   I wish for you that whenever fiery trials may come, the consuming fire
   may spend itself upon your corruptions, but oh, may God grant that
   there may be nothing in it that shall touch your better nature! May it
   be a conserving as well as a consuming fire! We do, some of us,
   acknowledge to have been in the furnace when it has been heated very
   hot. Weary nights have been appointed to us and days of anguish of body
   and of sinking of spirit. We have lain cast out even from the Presence
   of God, sometimes in our apprehensions, in the very deeps of the Valley
   of the Shadow of Death, and God-- blessed be His name--He has sent the
   fire and come with it, and we have not been consumed, but can sing this
   day of judgment and of mercy! That mingled song is well set forth in
   the bush that burned, but was not burnt--burned, but was not consumed!
   I would not wish for any of you perfect immunity from trouble, lest you
   should miss the coming through tribulation into the inheritance of the
   Kingdom of God, but I do pray for you that when the trouble comes, the
   God that raised the trouble may come with it, so that you may be
   burned, but not consumed!

   I will not tarry longer over this explanation of the text, but now most
   earnestly and from my heart I wish to you, Beloved, this blessing. May
   "the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush" dwell with you! In your
   dwellings, may His good will dwell. Whatever your homes may be, may God
   be with you there. May His good will be with your husband, with your
   wife and your children, your servants, your business, your field, your
   estate. May He that dwelt in the bush condescend to dwell in that
   little chamber and that narrow room! If a bush can hold Him, so can
   your poor room! If a bush revealed Him, so can your bed--yes, and your
   sickbed, too. Believe in it--that God's good will can perfume every
   chamber of your dwelling, can make your going out and your coming in to
   be blessed, and all your ways the same! I wish for you, Beloved, that
   "the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush" may dwell with you
   wherever you may be!

   Are you like Moses just now, alone and solitary in a wilderness? Have
   you come into this great city, and are you yet feeling as if you were a
   lone person, as in a desert? May "the good will of Him that dwelt in
   the bush" be with you and may God reveal Himself to you in your
   solitude, as He did to the Prophet at Horeb. Perhaps you will be called
   from this day forth to conflict, as Moses stood before Pharaoh, and had
   to face the wrath of the king. May you confound your adversaries and be
   very mighty for your God! Possibly God intends to give you success in
   your service--like Moses, you will bring out Israel from under bondage.
   May "the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush" keep you sober in
   success and humble in prosperity! Perhaps before you there shall soon
   be a difficulty as great as that which met the children of Israel
   before Pharaoh--you will come to the Red Sea--the rocks will be on
   either hand. Pursuers may be behind you. May the good will of Him that
   dwelt in the bush and was with Moses, be with you in the hour of stern
   trial. Through your Red Sea, may the Lord lead you, as He led the
   children of Israel like a flock!

   Perhaps you will be subject to many provocations, as Moses was from the
   people whom he loved. They spoke of stoning him. They murmured against
   the Lord and against His servant, Moses. May you be as meek as Moses,
   because the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush shall overshadow
   you! Possibly you may have a long life of Christian service before you.
   It may be for 40 years you will have to carry a people in your bosom,
   and nurture them for the Lord. My Brothers in the ministry, I wish the
   good will of Him that dwelt in the bush to be with you through all your
   toilsome tasks. Perhaps you are soon to die. Old age is creeping upon
   you. May you die like Moses, blessing the people with the good will of
   Him that dwelt in the bush with you to your last moment! And may your
   spirit climb her Pisgah and look from the top of Nebo, and have a view
   of the Glory to be revealed--the brooks that flow with milk and honey,
   and the goodly land! May you see it, even unto Lebanon, and in those
   last moments of yours, before your spirit melts into Glory, may

   "the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush" still be with you!
   Beloved, this is wished to you all! And I speak not my wish, but the
   benediction of the Lord upon all His servants, "The good will of Him
   that dwelt in the bush be with you." But, alas, all here are not
   servants of God. Yet even to them will I--

   III. ANXIOUSLY DESIRE THAT THIS WISH MAY BE FULFILLED TO YOU ALL.

   Oh, Sinner, tonight may He that dwelt in the bush call you! Moses
   little thought of it. He was keeping sheep, but a burning bush was
   enough to attract him. These few simple, feeble, but affectionate
   words, may, perhaps, be like the bush to you. Or if not, perhaps, a
   trouble at home will come and be like a thorn bush to you. I pray it
   may, and may God be in the bush! I do desire that God would in some way
   speak to you careless ones and arrest you, for you must come to know
   Him, or you will everlastingly perish! And may you be humbled in the
   Presence of God, each one of you, as Moses was, for he took off his
   shoes, feeling that the place whereon he stood was holy ground, and he
   was unholy. May you feel the solemnity of your position--a dying man
   soon to meet his Maker--a guilty man soon to meet his Judge--a despiser
   of Christ soon to see Christ on His Throne! O Soul, may you put off
   your carelessness and have done with your neglect, and begin to pray!
   And as the Lord of the burning bush said to Moses that He knew the
   sorrows of his people, I do pray, oh Sinner, that when you stand humbly
   before the Presence of God, you may see that God has pity upon you! May
   you look to Jesus on the Cross and see where He was like a bush that
   was burned with the anger of God, though not consumed-- and may you, as
   you look, hear Him say, "I know your sorrows, for I have borne your
   sins and carried your transgressions for you." And oh, may you find
   peace tonight!

   Oh, it does not matter whether it is the back side of the desert, or
   the back gallery of the Tabernacle, or down below, beneath the
   galleries, or where it is--it will be a blessed spot to you if you find
   God tonight! Moses could never forget that spot near to Horeb, neither
   will you if the Lord should appear to you! It matters not who the
   preacher is, though he should be no more than a bush, yet shall he be
   an angel of God to you! The Lord grant that such an appearance may come
   to you by faith. May you look to Christ tonight, for, if not, you will
   have to see God, by-and-by, as a consuming fire! And remember this
   word, "Beware, you that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and
   there be none to deliver you!" May you never know the meaning of that,
   but on the contrary, may "the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush"
   be with you! Amen and amen.

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: EXODUS3.

   Verse 1. Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law,
   the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the
   desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. It must have
   been a great change for Moses, after 40 years in the court of Pharaoh,
   to be spending another 40 years in the wilderness. But it was not
   wasted time--it required the first two periods to make Moses fit for
   the grand life of the last forty. He must be a prince and he must be a
   shepherd, that he might be both a ruler and a shepherd to God's people,
   Israel. He must be much alone. He must have many solitary conversations
   with his own heart. He must be led to feel his own weakness. And this
   will be no loss of time to him--he will do more in the last 40 years
   because of the 80 years thus spent in preparation! And it is not lost
   time that a man takes in putting on his harness before he goes to the
   battle, or that the reaper spends in sharpening his scythe before he
   cuts down the corn.

   2. And the Angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out
   of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned
   with fire, but the bush was not consumed. How near God seemed in those
   ages when He could be beheld in a bush or sitting under an oak! And is
   He not equally near us if we are but prepared for His Presence? Surely
   pure eyes are scarce, or sights of God would be more frequent, for "the
   pure in heart shall see God."

   3-5. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,
   why the bush is not burnt. And when the LORD saw that he turned aside
   to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,
   Moses, Moses. And he said. Here am I. And He said, Draw not near here:
   take off your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is
   holy ground. God is not to be viewed by curiosity--He is not to be
   approached by presumption. A holy trembling well becomes the man who
   would commune with the Most Holy God. We are not fit for communion with
   God without some measure of preparation. There is something to be put
   off before we can behold the Lord.

   6. Moreover He said, I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham,
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he
   was afraid to look upon God. Partly because of the universal
   superstition that if God appeared to any man, he would surely die--but
   in Moses' case, perhaps more because of an appreciation of the holiness
   of God and of his own unworthiness. There is not a man among us but who
   must do as Moses did if we are in a right state of mind. They who think
   they are perfect might presume to look, but they who are truly so, as
   Moses was, would, as he did, hide his face, for he was afraid to look
   upon God.

   7. And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people
   who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their
   taskmasters; for I know their sorrows. Beautiful verse. God had seen
   and God had heard, as if their griefs had had two avenues to His heart.
   God sees not with eyes, and hears not with ears, as we do, but He
   speaks after the manner of men, and He says by two ways they had
   reached his very soul--"I have surely seen the affliction--I have heard
   their cries." And then He adds, as if to show the perfection of His
   sympathy with them, "I know their sorrows." Now it is quite true today
   concerning us and concerning our God--He has seen, He has heard and He
   knows--"I know their sorrows." When the sorrow is known, then God
   begins to work. He is no passive spectator of the misery of His chosen,
   but His hands go with His heart.

   8. And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
   Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and a
   large land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of
   the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites,
   and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. "Now, therefore, behold, the cry of
   the children of Israel is come unto Me," and when the cry of God's
   children goes unto Him, depend upon it, there will be something moving
   before long! When a father hears the cries of his children, when a
   mother hears the cry of her baby, it is not long before there will be a
   movement of the heart and of the hands! I am sure, Brothers and
   Sisters, there have been crises in English history which have been
   entirely due to the prayers of God's people. There have been singular
   occurrences which the mere reader of history cannot understand, but
   there is a number still alive who wait upon God in prayer, and they
   make history. There is more history made in the closet than in the
   cabinet of the ministry. There is a greater power at the back of the
   throne than the carnal eye can see, and that power is the cry of God's
   children!

   9-10. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come
   unto Me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians
   oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will send you unto Pharaoh,
   that you may bring forth My people, the children of Israel, out of
   Egypt. I do not wonder that Moses opened his eyes when he knew what a
   poor creature he was for God to say, "Come now, therefore, and I will
   send you unto Pharaoh"--the very man whose life was sought by
   Pharaoh--"I will send you unto Pharaoh"--the man who had been rejected
   by his own people when he took their part--"You may bring forth My
   people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt." Oh, let us be ready for
   any commission! If God were to say that He would build up Heaven by the
   poorest and meanest among us, it would not be for us to draw back! Let
   Him do what He wills with us! Oh, for a faith to believe that in the
   midst of our weakness, God's strength would appear.

A Memorable Interview

   (No. 3541)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Then He said to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold My hands;
   and reach here your hand, and thrust it into My side; and be not
   faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered, and said unto Him, My
   Lord and my God." John 20:27,28.

   WE are, all of us, apt to fall into a wrong state of heart, not because
   we are unconverted, nor yet because we are false to Christ, but simply
   because of our natural infirmities. So long as we are in this body,
   exposed to trial and temptation, we shall be prone to start aside like
   a broken bow. Thomas was a true-hearted follower of Jesus. He loved his
   Master. It had been a severe shock to his sensitive disposition and his
   thoughtful mind to see his Master betrayed, arraigned, scourged,
   crucified, dead and buried. He could not, at once, rally from the
   agitation it caused him, or think it possible that Jesus could have
   risen from the dead. Pondering the matter scrupulously, it seemed to
   him to involve too great a miracle to be credited--far beyond anything
   to be expected! He would require, he said, very clear and satisfactory
   proofs before he would believe it. In like manner, you and I have, each
   of us, our characteristic faults. We may not be too thoughtful, like
   Thomas--we may, perhaps, be too thoughtless--and that is quite as
   mischievous. Even our pleasing qualities which adorn us as virtues may
   become our temptations. The best point about us, as a sound judgment
   was in the case of Thomas, may become the very snare that entangles us.
   Let no man judge his fellow. Above all, let no man exalt himself. He
   that is in his best estate, today, may be in spiritual poverty
   tomorrow! He who rejoices in God and walks in holy consistency may,
   before another sun has risen--few, though the hours of interval
   are--have felt his feet slide from under him and so fallen from his
   steadfastness as to have dishonored his God, and pierced himself
   through with many sorrows!

   God grant that our meditation may be for the comfort of some present,
   while we proceed to notice the Master and the servant--Jesus and
   Thomas--narrowly looking at the actions of them both.

   I. LET THE MASTER FIRST ENGAGE OUR ATTENTION--THE MASTER IN THE
   PRESENCE OF AN UNBELIEVING DISCIPLE WHO HAS TREATED HIM WITH NO LITTLE
   PRESUMPTION AND RASHNESS.

   How exquisitely touching, His gentleness! Does He upbraid Thomas? Is
   there indignation in His tone? Is there petulance in His chiding? Does
   He exclaim, "How dare you doubt that I am alive?" Or turns He upon him
   with some rough sentence, asking "Why this impertinence that you should
   speak of putting your finger into My wounds, and thrusting your hand
   into My side? Unworthy servant, from this moment I disown you for
   having spoken so disrespectfully of your Lord and Master." No, far from
   it! He rather takes Thomas on his own ground, considers his
   infirmities, and meets them precisely as they are, without a single
   word of rebuke until the close--and even then He puts it very lovingly.
   The whole conversation was, indeed, a rebuke, but so veiled with love
   that Thomas could scarcely think it so. He speaks to him as if nothing
   had occurred to give any cause of offense, or by his presumption to
   occasion any estrangement.

   Dwell for a moment on the mercy which our Lord must have shown--and the
   blessed patience He must have exercised, to bear thus with Thomas.
   Ought he not to have known from the Old Testament that the Christ would
   rise from the dead? Had he not been reminded once and again by his
   Master of the prophecies which spoke concerning the death of Christ,
   and the Glory that should follow? Had he not heard the Master, Himself,
   frequently say that the third day He would rise again? He must have
   been present with the other Apostles when they turned His oracular
   sentences over in their minds and said, one to another, "What does He
   mean by this, that He shall suffer and that He shall rise?" And had He
   not just before seen the women and conferred with the Apostles who
   testified that they had found an empty tomb, that they had been told by
   angels that Jesus had risen--yes, more--that when they were sitting
   together, Jesus had appeared

   in their midst? Yet, so strong was his unbelief, that he puts his own
   judgment against their assertion of fact, against the Inspired
   Scriptures, against the thrilling words that fell from the Master's own
   lips, against the united, concurrent acknowledgment of all the
   Brothers! And do you think not, Brothers and Sisters, that our
   willfulness is sometimes as irrational and unwarranted as his? We
   harbor doubts in the teeth of accumulated evidences and then credit
   ourselves with being wise and right, while we disparage all others as
   being foolish and wrong! The principle which lies at the root of all
   the heresies and the schisms that tear and divide the Church is just
   that self-confidence which will not let us yield, even though better
   men than ourselves--yes, though the united consent of the whole Church
   should bear testimony to a fact or a Truth of God to which we disagree!
   Through some lack of information or through some flaw of judgment, we
   judge differently from our companions and forthwith our
   self-approbation is unyielding, and our conduct is intolerant! It was
   no small scandal thus to put himself in opposition to the Master, in
   opposition to the Scripture and in opposition to all his fellow
   servants! Still, our Lord Jesus Christ forbears to utter a word of
   denunciation. He just says, "Reach here your finger and behold My
   hands; and reach here your hand and thrust it into My side; and be not
   faithless, but believing." Softer words He could not have spoken! He
   responds without reproach. Such loving kindness and tender mercy as
   David was known to sing of old, did our blessed Redeemer show!

   Another ground for admiring our Lord's great patience with Thomas is
   that Thomas had dared to dictate the terms upon which he would
   believe--and he had selected such terms as must have been most
   offensive had Jesus Christ been of a lofty, imperious, uncondescending
   spirit. Who is Thomas that he should put his hands into those wounds so
   lately healed? That side pierced by the soldier's spear? Is Thomas to
   make another road to that sacred heart? Strange that he should have
   asked so mysterious a sign to strengthen his faith! What? Was there no
   other way of believing in his Lord but that he must pass his finger and
   his hand into the very wounds of that blessed body? Ah, see how
   presumptuous the servant! See, also, how sympathizing the Master! Was
   it not asking too much--far too much? Such a prayer ought not to have
   come from a disciple who had never forsaken his Master, much less from
   Thomas, who had fled with the rest, and had been absent when the
   Apostles had gathered together and seen the Master! But yet Jesus is so
   forbearing towards him. I know not whether to wonder more at the
   impertinence of the servant or the clemency of the Master! Let us take
   the lesson to ourselves. Have we during the past week fallen into a
   signal state of gross unbelief? Have we been thinking harsh thoughts of
   God? Has some sin suspended our communion with our Savior? Are we now
   cold at heart and void of spiritual emotion? Do we feel quite unworthy
   to draw near unto Him who loved us with so great a love? Be not
   desponding! The God of All Patience will not desert you! The love which
   our Lord Jesus Christ bears to His people is so great that He passes by
   their transgression, iniquity and sin! No, there is no anger on His
   part to divide you from your Lord. Behold! He comes over the mountains
   of your sins! He leaps over the hills of your follies. Since He thus
   graciously comes to you, will you not gladly come to Him? Do not think
   for a moment that He will frown or repulse you! He will not remind you
   of your cold prayers, your neglected closet, your unread Bible--nor
   will He chide you for losing occasions of fellowship--but He will
   receive you graciously, love you freely and grant you just what, at
   this moment, you need! I pray you notice the Master's patience. Come to
   Him, dear child of His, you beloved disciple of His, and have
   fellowship with Him now!

   While we are speaking of the Master, I should next like to call your
   attention to the Master's great care. He had been to see His disciples
   once. He had stood in their midst and said, "Peace be unto you." He had
   given them their commission, had breathed upon them and given them the
   Holy Spirit. But there was an absent one. Well, "what man of you having
   an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety and
   nine in the wilderness, and go and seek after that which has gone
   astray?" There was one missing and Jesus must come again! There must be
   the same salutation of peace. There must be the same blessing bestowed,
   again, for Thomas must not be left out in the distribution of spiritual
   gifts. Thomas ought to have sought after Christ, especially after
   having been absent on the first occasion when He visited them. He
   surely ought to have said, "My Master came to me and I was not there! I
   will, therefore, seek Him, be He where He may, and I will tell Him how
   I regret that I should have missed the golden opportunity of His
   Presence." But, Beloved, Thomas did not seek His Master. Therein He was
   just like we are! It is preventing Grace, Brothers and Sisters--it is
   Grace that is beforehand with us--even with our faint desires, which
   comes to us from Jesus Christ. Oh, how our Lord outruns us! Our sense
   of need is not as swift of foot as His perception of our need! Long
   before we know we need Him, He understands that we require Him and He
   comes to us to bless us! It was for one He came, and for that one who
   did not

   seek Him! He was found of one who sought Him not! You might have
   thought that Thomas would have been as well left alone a little while.
   We would have said, "Well, if he is so obstinate as to lay down such
   conditions, let him cool a bit! Let him just stop awhile in the cold
   till he is willing to come in at the door, and not to make conditions
   that he must come in at the window, or by some way of his own. So let
   him wait, for beggars ought not to be choosers, nor should impertinent
   disciples be tolerated." Yes, but Jesus will tolerate what we will
   not--and He will put up with us when we cannot put up with our Brothers
   and Sisters! We have not half as much to bear with from them as He has
   from us! Though Thomas might thus have been left, and deserved to have
   been left, yet Jesus came to him because He knew that His coming to him
   would be much better than letting him stay away. So, Disciple, do not
   say to yourself, "I cannot come to the Table tonight, I do not feel
   fit! I shall not strive after fellowship with Christ--I do not feel as
   if my soul could enjoy it." No, but it will do you no good to stay
   away! Will you turn aside from the Master? Will you refuse the symbols
   of His death? Be not so rash and inconsiderate, I entreat you! Why
   should He not come to you? Before that bread is broken, you may have
   experienced a delightful change in the state of your heart and, with
   pleasing surprise you may be crying out, like Thomas, "My Lord and my
   God." And, oh, is it not blessed to think that Christ does not stop
   till His disciples invite Him? He does not wait for them to get ready
   for Him! No, He comes to them and meets them--and finds them before
   they have sought Him! If you are in the mood of Thomas, perhaps you may
   be insisting upon some signs and wonders, as he did. Know you not that
   the Master can give you His own sign, unfold His own wonder and bestow
   upon you such a blessing that your heart shall scarcely have room
   enough to receive it? His tenderness and His care baffle all our
   thoughts and expectations!

   Though we have already observed it, linger, I beseech you, upon the
   Master's matchless condescension. Behold the Lord of Life, who had
   overcome the sharpness of death and passed out of the portals of the
   tomb in triumph, having spoiled principalities and powers and
   overthrown sin, death, and Hell--the Son of God, at whose Resurrection
   angels had attended, glad to wait as servants upon His royalty, that
   Lord--what do you think? He must strip Himself to gratify a
   disobedient, unbelieving disciple--yes, He must strip Himself! It were
   not enough to show His hands--that were kindness--but those hands must
   be touched and those wounds, themselves, must be probed by a finger all
   too curious! It would have been profane, had it not been for the Divine
   Pity that allowed it! The way into His heart must be revealed. Well,
   well, but He did it. Angels must have been shocked when they heard a
   man say, "I will not believe unless He bares His side to me"--still, He
   did it! Yes, just before He died, you will remember how He laid aside
   His garments and took a towel and girded Himself, and washed His
   disciples' feet. Now that He is risen from the dead, He is the same
   Christ--and if He condescended, then, to wash His disciples feet, He
   will condescend, now, to bear with a disciple's bad manners and will
   even meet him in his infirmities! If they cannot be healed without a
   sight of His wounded Person, he shall gaze upon His side again! He will
   do anything for the love of His people. There is no kindness too costly
   for Christ to show!

   Now then, you who, while eagerly longing for His company, hide your
   face and blush for very shame, do you say, "Lord, I am not worthy that
   You should come under my roof. My heart is not worthy to receive You as
   a guest"? True, you are not worthy--neither was Thomas. Yet you shall
   have His favor and rejoice in the light of His Countenance if you sigh
   and cry for it! Doubtless you have been very far, during the week, from
   what you, yourself, wish you had been. Nevertheless, "He will blot out
   your iniquities like a cloud, and your transgressions like a thick
   cloud." Your old friends may have passed you in the street and did not
   recognize you because you are now so poor, but Jesus knows you! No one,
   perhaps, knows the privations you have had to put up with, poor
   Christian. You fancy you are despised and neglected by
   everybody--perhaps it may be your fancy, yet it is cutting to the heart
   even to think that your Christian Brothers and Sisters look down upon
   you! But Jesus never looks down contemptuously on His people. He
   condescends to stand on their platform and put Himself on a level with
   them with a sacred familiarity suited to their case. Full often He
   draws most near with most engaging smiles to those who are in the
   saddest plight. This is how Jesus is known to act. He never speaks
   proudly and loftily. His condescension unto His children, like His
   watchfulness over them, is unvarying!

   Once more, the Master's bounty challenges our admiration and our
   confidence. When Thomas had received what he asked for, you might
   easily have conjectured that he would be put down in the second class
   of disciples. Instead of that, however, he was well commended in the
   Apostleship, and though not present when Jesus breathed on them and
   said, "Receive you the Holy Spirit," yet on the Day of Pentecost Thomas
   received the same cloven tongue and the same power as the rest. Indeed,
   we have reason to believe that Thomas became as earnest an Apostle, as
   faithful a witness, and as

   blessed a martyr of the faith of Christ, as either Peter or James! The
   Master will not stint His goodness because we once and again display
   our meanness. No, Beloved, He will give us according to our ability to
   receive. If we are not able to receive, today, He will enlarge our
   desires and expand our capacities till tomorrow we may be able to
   receive from His fullness and Grace for Grace! Come, then, you hungry,
   starving Souls, you Believers who are coming near to penury and
   spiritual bankruptcy--draw near in the spirit of love to Christ who is
   as certainly present in this place with us as He was with them in that
   chamber where the 12 were gathered! Draw near in spirit and in truth to
   Him and your souls shall be enriched to your own profit and to the
   Glory of God! And now I have a few words to say about-- II. THE
   SERVANT.

   Thomas, struck with the Master's knowledge of what had been going on in
   his heart and overwhelmed with the manifestation of the Master's
   Presence and His Power, exclaimed, "My Lord and my God." These five
   words are full of meaning. Let me endeavor to interpret them for you.
   First, they were an expression of faith. Thomas now avows the faith
   which before he had disclaimed. "I will not believe," he said,
   "except--except--except." Now he believes a great deal more than some
   of the other Apostles did--so he openly avows it. Thomas was the first
   Divine who ever taught the Deity of Christ from His wounds! Nor has
   every Divine since then been able to see the Deity of Christ in His
   wounded Humanity risen from the dead. This Thomas did. He declared the
   proper Humanity of Christ when he touched Him and he declared His
   proper Deity when he avowed Him to be both Lord and God! Thomas was
   slow in arriving at facts, but he had a comprehensive mind--and when he
   did arrive at a conviction, he grasped it thoroughly in all its
   bearings. Peter would be impetuous and leap to a conclusion, but Thomas
   must consider the circumstances, weigh the testimony, try, judge, and
   prove the evidences before he acknowledged a Truth of God. When his
   judgment did yield assent, he was firm. There was no shaking. He
   understood the Truth he adhered to better than others. Delightful in
   the ears of Christ, my Brothers and Sisters, is the expression of our
   faith! Let none of us hesitate to go over in our minds our avowal of
   faith in Him "who lives and was dead, and is alive forevermore."

   It well becomes us, sometimes, to perform what the Catholics call,
   "acts of faith." I mean in holy contemplation and quiet meditation, to
   declare before the Lord that we believe in the facts that are made
   known to us and the Doctrines that have been delivered to us. We
   believe that Jesus is the Son of God--forever be His name adored! That
   He is self-existent and full of Power and Glory! We believe that He
   laid aside that Glory and became a Man in the likeness of sinful flesh,
   that He did not disdain to sleep upon His virgin mother's breast. He
   lived a life of holiness and died a death of scorn and ignominy. He
   slept in the tomb and the third day He rose again from the dead. He
   ascended into Heaven. He sits at the right hand of God, even the
   Father. He reigns over all things for His people, having power over all
   flesh that He may give Eternal Life to as many as the Father has given
   Him. He shall shortly come to judge the quick and the dead. Among the
   sons of men He shall reign. He shall sit upon the Throne of His Father
   David. Prayer, also, shall be made for Him continually and daily shall
   He be praised!

   The short but expressive avowal of faith which Thomas made suggests to
   me this word of counsel. We should frequently make before God a
   declaration of our faith in the Deity of our Lord Christ and in all the
   Glories which surround His Character. Let this be done vocally when you
   can--or otherwise mentally--for the exercise is profitable. But these
   words, "My Lord and my God," sound a little different to me from a
   simple avowal of faith. It was, as someone has said, like the cry of a
   dove that at last had found its mate. Poor Thomas! He doubted his
   Master, but he needed Him and could not be happy without Him! Now he
   has come flying back and he has found Him, and he seems to put his
   head, as it were, into the bosom of his Master, and to begin to weep
   and sigh like a poor child that has lost its mother in the streets of
   London and, when it is brought back again, cannot say anything else
   but, "My mother," and, "my mother," and," my mother," and feels so
   happy to think it has found, again, the dear bosom on which to rest! So
   Thomas seems to say, "I have found You, my Master, my Lord and my God."
   He seems to humble himself, as though he would say, "How could I doubt
   You? Where have I been? What have I been thinking? What has my
   obstinate mind driven me to? What did I say? What did I ask? How could
   I be so impertinent? My Lord and my God! You have forgiven it all and
   in Your Presence I seem to moan it out in those few words. Your silly
   servant, Your foolish servant, but You, my blessed Master, my
   condescending Master, 'my Lord and my God!'" Well now, Beloved, there
   is something very sweet in this. Though I called it moaning, still
   there is much music in it. Come now, you who have wandered, come and
   tell Christ at the Table all about

   it! Come and tell Him that you are grieved and that you are not so
   grieved as you ought to be. Tell Him you are sorry that you should not
   have lived with Him day by day. Your self-reproach may well be keen--

   "Wretch that I am to wander thus In search of vain delights."

   Penitently bewail before Him that you should have been so bewitched as
   to cleave to things below, and let your God, your Savior, go! Intense
   feeling commonly finds expression in few words. Silence is sometimes
   more thrilling than speech. "My Lord and my God" is the breathing of a
   contrite heart relieved in having found the Grace it needs!

   The short prayer, however, "My Lord and my God," is the outcome of more
   than one emotion. If it involved a pang, it included an intense
   pleasure. Was it not a joyous astonishment which begot those words It
   was so sweet to Thomas that he hardly thought his fellow disciples
   would be able to appreciate so great a wonder. It was too much for
   himself, so he addresses himself to the Master, as if He, alone, being
   the greatest marvel, could sympathize with him. "I marvel," he seemed
   to say. "I could not have believed it! I saw the traitor kiss Your
   cheek. I saw You dragged off with staves and lanterns to that lion's
   den! I saw You when You were in Pilate's hall, tried and mocked. I saw
   You when You were fastened to the tree. I stood there and I saw You
   bleed and die. I saw Your body taken down and wrapped in spices--and is
   it the same, the very same? Oh, yes, I recognize You. I know those
   hands. I took those loaves from them when the thousands were fed in
   Galilee. I know that face--full many a time have I looked with beaming
   eyes on that loving Countenance of Yours! I know that side--it is the
   same side I saw the soldier pierce, and I know it! It is the same! It
   is Yourself, Yourself, Yourself, the risen Christ! Oh, wonder of
   wonders! I can say no less! I can say no more! "'My Lord and my God!'"

   Well now, holy wonder, Beloved, is no mean kind of worship! It is,
   perhaps, no mean part of the worship of Heaven. I like that verse we
   sing--

   "Then let me mount the starry way, To the bright worlds of endless day
   And sing with rapture and surprise, Your loving kindness in the skies."

   Will it not be a surprise when we get there? Though, indeed, we shall
   see nothing in Heaven but what we have been told of on earth for it
   will be just such a Heaven as God has told us of--yet we shall say that
   the half was not told us because we did not understand what we heard
   and could not enter into the meaning of deep spiritual revelations! Oh,
   what astonishment might seize upon us now if we could really grip the
   thought--and I hope we shall! "Jesus has loved, and lived, and died for
   me--and now He lives and pleads for me!" Oh, Believer, get to see
   Christ now with the optics of your mind! See Him now exalted in the
   highest heavens, though once rejected of men and, as with astonishment
   you behold the ineffable splendor of that starry Throne of God,
   surrounded by ten thousand times ten thousand of the chariots of God,
   and chariots of messengers of fire, all waiting to obey His Sovereign
   Will--as you see the Man whose head was once crowned with thorns, from
   the highest seat that Heaven affords claiming Eternal Sovereignty, bow
   your head in devout astonishment, fall at His feet and, giving tongue
   to your rapture, exclaim, "My Lord and my God!"

   And did not Thomas, by such an exclamation as this, renew his personal
   betrothal to Christ and his positive consecration to His service "My
   Lord," he says, "You Are, and I am Your servant. My God, henceforth You
   Are, and I am Your worshipper as long as I live." Beloved, years ago
   some of us were first spiritually espoused to Christ. Gladly would I
   remember those blessed hours when my young heart went out after Him and
   His blessed heart of love was revealed to me! We ought not to forget
   those times, for He does not forget them. He says to Israel, "I
   remember you, the kindness of your youth, and the love of your
   espousals." With what enthusiasm we sung--

   "'Tis done--the great transaction's done! I am my Lord's, and He is
   nine-- He drew me and I followed on Glad to obey the voice DDivine."
   Perhaps many years have passed over you since then, but whether they
   have been many or few, I am sure we have not been invariably true to
   those vows and resolutions. Our memory of Him has not been equal to His
   mindfulness of us. Now, if the Lord should come to you afresh and give
   you a choice season of fellowship with Him, would it not be a most
   suitable response to give yourself up to Him afresh? Should we not
   often do this? Would not the freshness of close fellowship be

   peculiarly suitable for the renewal of our Covenant with our Lord, and
   of our consecration of ourselves to His service? On that night you were
   baptized, you could sing sincerely--

   "High Heaven which heard the solemn vow,

   That vow renewed shall daily hear,

   Till in life's latest hour I bow,

   And bless in death a bond so dear." Oh, that God's Holy Spirit would
   enable you now to say in your soul, "Jesus, the despised of men, whom
   the great ones of this world know not, in whose blessed Person and
   redemptive work they will not believe, I take You, my Master. I
   acknowledge You to be my Lord. Your people shall be my people. Your God
   and Father shall be my God. Your blood shall be my confidence, and Your
   Law my rule. Your love shall quicken my love. Your life shall be my
   example. Your Glory shall be the one objective for which I strive. You,
   O Christ, are 'my Lord and my God.'" So shall your faith abound and all
   your Graces flourish!

   Do I hear some timid voice from this congregation whispering a
   complaint? "Ah, there is nothing for me! He is speaking to the
   disciples. When the doors are shut, I am shut outside as a stranger.
   There is nothing for me. I am a sinner." Oh, but I tell you, if you
   will but knock, Jesus Christ will come outside to you! The doors are
   not shut to keep out poor sinners from the Presence of the Savior! Do
   you need Jesus to reveal Himself to you? Exalted in the highest
   heavens, He looks down upon you now! His voice is calling you, "Come
   unto Me, and I will give you rest." Oh, poor Sinner, if you cannot put
   your finger into the print of the nails, yet believe that Jesus died!
   Then trust Him and rely upon His merits. Cast yourself flat at His
   feet! Stay yourself upon His Passion and Atonement, and you shall be
   saved--saved now--saved without a moment's delay! So shall all these
   other joys be your, for you, too, shall be numbered with the family and
   you shall feast upon the children's meat, and be partakers of all the
   privileges of the sons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty!

   EXPOSITION BY C. H. SPURGEON: John 20:18-31

   Verse 18. Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen
   the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her.She was a true
   woman--one whom they had known well enough to be quite able to trust
   her, and her witness ought to have been believed--but there were some
   that doubted.

   19. Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when
   the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the
   Jews, came Jesus andstoodin their midst, andsaid unto them, Peace be
   unto you. How He came there, we do not know, but doors cannot shut Him
   out. Is there any door between my soul and Christ, tonight, then? Have
   I shut myself up in the chamber of doubt, despondency, unbelief? He can
   come to me! While the doors are yet shut, He can appear within my
   spirit and say, "Peace be to you. "Oh, that He would do so! Do we not
   cry to Him to come and breathe peace upon us?

   20. And when He had so said, He showed unto them His hands and His
   side. That they might be sure it was He--the same who had died by
   crucifixion--that they might see how intimate He was with
   them--familiar--that His scarcely healed wounds should be seen by them.

   20. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord. Oh, for such
   a sight! There is a depth of gladness in a risen Christ. Those wounds
   preach peace and joy!

   21-23. Then said Jesus to them again. Peace be unto you: as My Father
   has sent Me, even so send I you. And when He had said this, He breathed
   on them, and said unto them, Receive you the Holy Spirit If you forgive
   the sins of any they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any,
   they are retained. Thus did Jesus Christ support and make forever true
   the preaching of His Word. Do we declare that the sins of penitents are
   remitted? They are remitted. Are we, in His name, bidden to declare
   that, "He that believes not shall be condemned"? So shall it be. He
   will make the Word of God which is uttered to be true. We shall not
   speak without our Master making the utterance of His Word to be a
   matter of fact.

   24. But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them
   when Jesus came. Perhaps he lived a long way off, or else, being rather
   slow, he had stopped about, doubting, and fearing, and questioning, and
   he had not got there in

   time. Anyway, he was not there. "Forsake not the assembling of
   yourselves together as the manner of some is," for it will be a loss to
   you, as it was to Thomas.

   25, Thee other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the
   Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in His hands the print
   of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust
   my hand into His side, I will not believe. Dogged, obstinate unbelief!
   Some have said he was a large-hearted man, who investigated truth. I do
   not see it. He had not gone to the tomb, like Peter and John, to look
   at the grave clothes, and to discover that Christ was not there. He
   does not appear to have investigated the testimony of Mary Magdalene
   and of the others. He was just as narrow-minded as he very well could
   be, as I believe modern doubters are with all their boast of their
   wonderful thoughtfulness and liberality! We have only their own
   opinion, I am sure, upon that matter--but when a man sounds his own
   trumpet, there is not much in it.

   26, 27. And after eight days His disciples were again within, and
   Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in
   their midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then He said to Thomas. For
   our Lord has a way of making personal application of His word. He looks
   after the sheep that is sick, and severs it from the flock, that He may
   deal with it in His wisdom. "Then He said to Thomas."

   27, 28. Reach here your finger, and behold My hands; and reach here
   your hand, and thrust it into My side; and be not faithless, but
   believing. And Thomas answered and said unto Him, My Lord and my God.
   And whether Thomas did put his finger into the print of His nails or
   not, we cannot tell. Everyone may think as he likes about that. He may
   have done so, or he may not, but this one thing happened, that he,
   "answered and said unto Him, 'My Lord and my God.'" He made a splendid
   leap from the depths of doubt to the firm rock of confidence! With two
   blessed "mys" he seems to grasp Christ with both hands, and in two
   grand words he pictures Him, "My Lord and my God."

   29. Jesus said unto Him, Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have
   believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.
   That is the faith--the true faith--that needs no buttressing and props,
   but believes the testimony ofGod.

   30, 31. And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His
   disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written
   that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son ofGod: and
   that believing you might have life through His name. God grant that the
   objective of writing the New Testament may be answered in each one of
   us!

A Precious Promise for a Pure People

   (No. 3542)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "Your eyes will see the King in His beauty." Isaiah 33:17.

   No doubt these words originally had a timely and strictly literal
   meaning for the people of Jerusalem. When the city was besieged by
   Sennacherib, the inhabitants saw Hezekiah in garb of mourning. How had
   he torn his clothes in sorrow! But the day would come, according to
   prophecy, when Sennacherib must fall. Those who counted the resources
   and estimated the strength or the weakness of the city would be far
   away--and then there would be times of liberty. The people would be
   able to travel to the utmost ends of Palestine, so they would see the
   land that is very far off. Hezekiah, himself, would come out in his
   robes of excellence and majesty on a joyful occasion to praise the
   Lord, and thus would the people's eyes see the king in his beauty. The
   passage, however, has been frequently used with quite another import,
   and that properly enough if it is thoroughly understood that it is by
   way of accommodation we take it, and that it is typically we trace it
   out. Have we not by faith seen our King in His robes of mourning? Have
   we not seen Jesus in the sorrowful weeds of affliction and humiliation
   while here below? Our faith has gazed upon Him in the torn garments of
   His Passion. We have beheld Him in His agony and bloody sweat, in His
   Crucifixion and His death. Well, now, another and a brighter view
   awaits us! Our eves will one day see the King in a more glorious array!
   We will behold Him as John saw Him on Patmos. We will behold the King
   in His beauty and then we shall enter and enjoy the land which is at
   present very far off.

   I think it meet and right to take such a word as this, tonight, when
   there are so many in our midst who are seeking and finding the Savior,
   because it is very certain that not long after their conversion, they
   will have to encounter some of the difficulties of the way. Sometimes
   within a few hours of their starting on pilgrimage, they are met by
   some of the dragons, or they fall into some Slough of Despond, or they
   are surprised by some Hill Difficulty! Therefore, they ought to be
   stimulated with encouragements--they need to be cheered and consoled by
   the prospect which lies before them. You will recollect how Christian
   is represented by Bunyan in his famous allegory to be reading in his
   book, as he went along, concerning the blessed country, the celestial
   land where their eyes should behold the King in His beauty--this
   beguiled the roughness of the road and made the pilgrim hasten on with
   more alacrity and less weariness. Now I am going to turn over one of
   the elementary pages of this Book. I want to show the young convert a
   vision pleasing and profitable for all Christians, young or old, the
   Glory that awaits him, the rest which is secured by the promise of God
   to every pilgrim who continues in the blessed road, and holds on, and
   holds out to the end! Your eyes, Beloved, you who have lately been
   converted to God--if by Divine Grace your conversion proves
   genuine--your eyes shall one day behold the King in His beauty! This
   may well inspire you with courage and encourage you to endure with
   patience all the difficulties of the way. When God brought His servant,
   Abraham, into the separated position of a stranger in a strange land,
   it was not long before He said to him, "Lift up, now, your eyes, and
   look to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and to the west,
   for all this land will I give to you and to your seed forever," as if
   to solace and cheer him in the place of his sojourn by the picture and
   the promise that greeted him. In like manner, you children of faithful
   Abraham, you who have left all for Christ's sake, look upon your future
   heritage from the spot of your present exile--and your hearts will
   exceedingly rejoice!

   We shall notice, first, the object to be seen--the King in His beauty!
   Then, secondly, the nature of this vision, for our eyes shall see the
   admirable spectacle. And, thirdly, we shall draw your attention to
   those to whom this favor will be granted. The context will help us to
   discover of whom it is the Lord speaks when He says, "Your eyes will
   see the King in

   His beauty." Not all eyes, but your eyes shall see the King in His
   beauty. What is this vision which is here promised to God's people?
   They are to see the King. They are to see-- I. THE KING IN HIS BEAUTY.

   THE KING--a sweet title which belongs to our Lord Jesus Christ as His
   exclusive prerogative, crowned with the crown of thorns once, but now
   wearing the diadem of universal monarchy! Other kings there are, but
   theirs is only a temporary title to temporal precedence among the sons
   of men. I had almost said theirs was a mimic sovereignty. He is the
   real King--the King of Kings--the King that reigns forever and forever!
   He is King, for He is God. Jehovah reigns. The Maker of the earth must
   be her King. He in whose hands are the deep places of the earth and the
   strength of the hills--He by whom all things exist and all things
   consist--He must of necessity reign! The government shall be upon His
   shoulders. His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty
   God. From the very fact that He is the Son of God, the express Image of
   His Father's Glory, He must be King! Because He condescended to veil
   Himself in our flesh, He derives a second title to the Kingdom--He is
   King now by His merits. Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and
   given Him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus,
   every knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and things in earth, and
   things under the earth! For the suffering of death, He was made, for a
   little while, lower than the angels, but now, seeing He has been
   obedient even unto death, even the death of the Cross, He has obtained
   a more excellent name than the angels and He is crowned with glory and
   honor. He is Head over all things now. In Him dwells all the fullness
   of the Godhead bodily. We rejoice to reflect upon Him as King by nature
   and then as King by due desert over a Kingdom which He has inherited by
   Divine right. He is King at this time by virtue of the conquests He has
   made, having spoiled the principalities and powers of darkness. In this
   world He fought the battle and so bravely did He fight it out that He
   could say, "It is finished." He made an end of sin! He made
   reconciliation for iniquity! He trampled death and Hell beneath His
   feet, and now He is King by force of arms. He entered into the strong
   man's house, wrestled with him and vanquished him, for He is stronger
   than he. He has led captivity captive and He has ascended upon
   high--King of kings and Lord of lords. Moreover He reigns supremely in
   some of our hearts. We have yielded to the sway of His love. We rejoice
   to crown Him. We never feel happier than when our hearts and tongues
   are singing--

   "Bring forth the royal diadem And crown Him Lord of All." I trust there
   are many more among you who have not yet yielded, who will yet yield
   your hearts to His power. Fresh provinces shall be added to His empire.
   New cities of Mansoul will open their gates that the Prince Emanuel may
   ride in and may sit in triumph there. Oh, that it may be so, for a
   multitude that no man can number shall cheerfully, joyfully acknowledge
   His sway and kiss the Son lest He be angry. But mark, the limit of His
   power is not according to the will of man, for where He does not reign
   by the joyful consent of His people and the mighty conquest of His
   love, He still exercises absolute dominion! Even the wicked are His
   servants! They shall be made in some way or other to subserve His
   glory, for He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.
   Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing? The King
   is anointed upon God's holy hill of Zion. King He is. He has a bit in
   the mouth of His most violent adversaries and He turns them about
   according to His own will. What though with mingled cruelty and rage
   men attack the Gospel of Christ, they strive in vain to thwart the
   Divine Decree! In ways mysterious and unknown to us, the Lord asserts
   His own supremacy. He reigns even where the rulers conspire and the
   people rebel against Him!

   Beloved, the Sovereignty of our Lord Jesus Christ, to which He is
   entitled by inheritance, is due to Him for His merits and in the
   equitable claim of His conquests--this reign of Christ extends over all
   things. He is the universal Lord. In this world He is Regent
   everywhere. By Him all things exist and consist. When I think of Him,
   it seems to me that the sea roars to His praise and the trees of the
   forests rejoice in His Presence. There is not a dewdrop that twinkles
   on the flower at sunrise but reflects His bounty. There is not an
   avalanche that falls from its Alp with thundering crash but resounds
   with tokens of His Power. The Great Shepherd reigns! The Lord is King!
   As Joseph was made ruler over all the land of Egypt, even so, according
   unto the word of Jesus, all the people are ruled. He has all things put
   under His feet, for it was of Him the Prophet sang of old, "You have
   made Him a little"--(or as the margin has it, a little while--"lower
   than the angels, and have crowned Him with glory and honor. You have
   put all things under His feet, all sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts
   of the field, the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea and whatever
   passes through the paths of the seas." Though we see not yet all things
   put under man, yet we see Jesus, who, for the suffering of death was
   made, for a little

   while, lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor. At this
   hour He rules on earth. Death and Hell are under His scepter. Satan,
   and the spirits that have followed his leadership, bite their iron
   bonds while they confess the power of the Divine Lord to be paramount.
   He can crush His enemies and break them with a rod of iron as a
   potter's vessel. His mighty power is felt and feared. But, oh, up
   yonder in Heaven, where the full beams of His Glory are unveiled, He
   reigns in matchless splendor! The angels worshipped Him when He was
   brought forth as the Only-Begotten into the world. So spoke the oracle,
   "Let all the angels of God worship Him." Seraphim and cherubim, are
   they not His messengers? He makes them like flames of fire. The
   redeemed by blood, what could they do? What is their joy, their
   occupation, their delight, but to sing forever, "Worthy is the Lamb
   that was slain to receive honor, and glory and dominion, and power"?
   Oh, tell us not of emperors--there is but One Imperial brow! Tell us
   not of monarchs, for the crown belongs to the blessed and only
   Potentate! He alone is King. As such, we think of Him and long for His
   appearing, when we shall hail Him the King in His beauty! I love to see
   His courtiers. That is a happy hour in which I can talk with one who
   has my Master's ear. I love to see the skirts of His garment as I come
   in fellowship with Him to His Table. I love to tread His courts. I love
   to hear His voice, even though I cannot yet see the face of Him that
   speaks with me! But to see the King-- to see the King, Himself! Oh, joy
   unspeakable! It is worth worlds, even, to have a good hope of beholding
   a sight so resplendent with the Glory of God!

   Note well the promise, "Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty."
   Does not this suggest to us that the King has been seen, though not in
   His beauty? He was seen on earth as the Prophet foretold, "despised and
   rejected of men, a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief." And as
   seen then, we are told there is no beauty that we should desire Him.
   There was a time when many were astonished at Him. His visage was more
   marred than any man, and His form more than the sons of men--that was
   in the day of His humiliation.

   But we are yet to see the King in His beauty, and I know, Beloved, that
   in part that vision does beam, even now, upon spirits before the Throne
   of God. I would not exactly say that they have eyes, for they have left
   these organs of sense behind them. They have not received the fullness
   of this promise--yet in a measure they see the beauty of the King, that
   beauty which His Father has put upon Him, now that He has ascended up
   on high and returned to the Father, having obeyed all His precepts and
   fulfilled all His will. His Father has already rewarded Him. He sits
   enthroned at the right hand of the Majesty on high--He is adored and
   worshipped! It is no small sight for our spirits to behold Him and
   adore. But remember the spirits in Heaven, without us, cannot be made
   perfect, so says the Apostle. They are waiting for the adoption--to
   wit, the redemption of the body--waiting for the trumpet of
   Resurrection. It is then, I think, that this blessed hope will be fully
   verified, "Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty." As Job puts it,
   "I know that my Redeemer lives and that He shall stand at the latter
   day upon the earth; and though, after my skin, worms destroy this body,
   yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself, and my
   eyes will behold, and not another." Our bodies shall be raised from the
   dead--

   "These eyes shall see Him in that day, The God that died for me-- And
   all my rising bones shall say-- Lord, who is like to Thee?"

   From the dark chambers of the grave we shall come forth with all the
   blood-bought company of the faithful. Then we shall see the King in His
   beauty! What beauty that will be! We steadfastly look for His appearing
   when He shall come the second time! This personal manifestation must be
   welcome to the saints. To see Him thenmust be to see His beauty! Our
   senses, relieved of infirmity, will be endowed with full capacity! Our
   Graces, being increased, our spirits will be lively and vigorous to
   appreciate His wonderful Person! As God and Man we do now believe in
   Him, but how little can our faith anticipate the vision! We acknowledge
   the mystery which is as yet unveiled. How little are we affected by the
   wonderful information which must astonish angels--that the Infinite can
   be joined with the finite, that the Godhead can be in perfect union
   with the manhood--the bush of the manhood burning with the glow of the
   Godhead, yet not thereby consumed! 'Tis matchless that the Eternal
   should link Himself with finite flesh! That He should hang upon His
   mother's breast who bears up the columns of the universe! Strange
   conjunction! Till we wake up in His likeness, we shall never thoroughly
   understand it. Oh, how amazement will resolve itself into admiration as
   we gaze upon Him who has a Nature that we have been familiar with and
   yet the proper Divinity which no man has seen or can see! What grandeur
   to behold! What rapture to experience when our eyes see the King in His
   beauty! The sight will overwhelm us. But in other respects

   than that which is essential to His Kingly dignity, the spectacle will
   be illustrious. In the hour of conquest He will take possession of a
   Throne which no rival dare dispute. Judas will be there, but he will
   not think of betraying Him. Pilate will be there, but he will not think
   of questioning Him. The Jews will be there, but they will not cry,
   "Crucify Him." The Romans will be there, but they will not think of
   hauling Him away to execution. His enemies in that day shall lick the
   dust! They shall be like chaff before the whirlwind in the day of His
   coming! And what will be the splendor of His Glory when He shall be
   proclaimed King of Kings in His beauty, with all the insignia of His
   royal power!

   He will have the beauty of state pageant, too, for He will assume
   office as Judge of the quick and the dead. Then will the trumpet sound
   and all the solemn pomp of the Great Assize will encircle Him round
   about. The vivid lightning will flash through the universe and the roar
   of His thunder shall awake the dead, while an irresistible summons
   shall compel them to appear before His dread tribunal! From His
   searching gaze no creature shall be hid, and every eye shall see Him.
   They, also, who pierced Him, and all the kindreds of the earth, shall
   weep and wail because of Him. But to us, that awful pomp will not be
   appalling, but a fit accessory on which His royal beauty is displayed!
   We shall admire the hand that holds the scepter, for we shall recognize
   it as the same hand that was once pierced for us. We shall admire the
   voice that condemns the wicked, and bids them, "Depart!" for that voice
   shall pronounce our welcome, saying, "Come, you blessed." We shall
   admire the Shepherd's crook with which He shall separate the sheep and
   the goats, for it will apportion us to eternal bliss, though it shall
   dismiss the goats to their eternal doom! Thrice happy and most blessed
   shall we be in that day! Terror and trouble shall be the lot of the
   world--trust and triumph shall then be the portion of the saints! He
   shall be admired in all them that believed! And when that final
   judgment shall have fulfilled its destined purpose, He shall be in His
   beauty seen as the Conqueror of all evil, the Conqueror of sin, of
   death and Hell. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is Death. How
   shall we see Him in His beauty when Death, itself, shall die! I cannot
   attempt to describe that beauty. It is far too dazzling for me to
   picture. I have dreamed of it sometimes in sacred soliloquies. My faith
   has tried to realize the facts which are revealed unto us by His
   Spirit. Still, the tongue cannot tell so much as the heart has
   conceived. There are unspeakable words which greet us in seasons of
   rapture which it is not lawful to utter. Whenever we are caught up to
   the third Heaven in rapturous meditation, we have but small news to
   tell men. But how inconceivable to us, now, is the Glory of Christ as
   it shall be when all His people are present with Him in Heaven!

   I have not touched upon the millennial age or the latter-day Glory.
   Your thoughts can fill up the vacancy. But what will be the beauty of
   Christ in Heaven in that day "when He shall make up His jewels"? What
   are the jewels of our King but His redeemed people? What will be the
   ornaments of His state but those for whom He shed His blood? And when
   they are all there, then we shall see the King in His beauty with all
   His jewels. Beauty! A shepherd's beauty lies much in his simple garb. A
   mother's beauty--very much of it is to be seen as she appears in the
   center of a happy and lovely family. So, beyond all doubt, the beauty
   of Christ will be most conspicuous when all His saints are with Him! I
   was in company with some good people lately, who were discussing the
   question whether we should see the saints in Heaven. I do not know
   whether they settled the question to their satisfaction, but I settled
   it very well to mine. I expect to see and know all the saints, to
   recognize them and rejoice with them--and that without the slightest
   prejudice to my being wholly absorbed in the sight of my Lord! Let me
   explain to you how this can be. When I went, the other day, into a
   friend's drawing room, I observed that on all sides there were mirrors.
   The whole of the walls were covered with glass--and everywhere I looked
   I kept seeing my friend. It was not necessary that I should fix my eyes
   upon him, for all the mirrors reflected him. Thus, Brothers and
   Sisters, it seems to me that every saint in Heaven will be a mirror of
   Christ, and that as we look upon all the loved ones, gazing round upon
   them all, we shall see Christ in everyone of them, so we shall still be
   seeing the Master in the servants, seeing the Head in all the members!
   It is I in them, and they in me. Is it not so? It will be all the
   Master. This is the sum total of Heaven--"Your eyes shall see the King
   in His beauty"--and they shall see the beauty of the King in all His
   people! Nor does it appear that the manifestation shall be ever
   withdrawn, or that we shall ever leave off seeing the beauty of our
   King. There is the mercy. "Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty,"
   on and on, and on still, and on, forever on, discerning more and more
   of the beauty, the inexhaustible beauty and splendor of the Sun of
   Righteousness, world without end! The theme grows upon us. We must curb
   ourselves. We can but skim the surface as the swallow does the brook.
   Now, as to--

   II. THE NATURE OF THIS VISION, we know it is in the future. "Your eyes
   shall see the King in His beauty." You poor sinners must be content
   with seeing the King in His majesty. Happy souls who come to see Jesus
   on the Cross! Oh, it

   is joy for them to look unto Him and be saved! Behold the Lamb of God!
   Behold the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world! Poor sin-sick
   Soul, are you looking to Jesus to be saved? If it is so in the present,
   then in the future you shall see Him in His beauty! It will be a vision
   for all. Their natural sense shall discern the real Savior, "Your eyes
   shall see the King in His beauty." It is not merely your spiritual
   perception, but your natural eyes. Does not Job express this conviction
   "whom my eyes shall see"? Oh, yes, not as it now is with this flesh and
   blood, but still with this body! I call you a vile body sometimes, my
   poor flesh and blood, and so you are. Yet in your origin there was
   something good and in your destiny there is something better, "Bone of
   your bone, and flesh of your flesh." Born of a woman as you were, and
   fed on bread as you must be, and though the worms devour you, yet shall
   you rise again! Oh, body, you are even now the temple of God! Know you
   not that your bodiesare the members of Christ? Know you not that your
   body is the temple of the Holy Spirit? These eyes shall see Him! They
   may be weeping eyes, aching eyes, weary eyes and sleepy eyes, yes, or
   even blind eyes, or your failing eyes on which the curtain is being
   drawn about you--your eyes shall see the King! When Heaven is in sight
   there will be no need for glasses to assist your vision. Your eyes, all
   strengthened to bear the light, as the eagle's eyes when the sun shines
   in its strength--"Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty." It will
   be a personal vision. "Whom my eyes shall see, and not another." It
   shall not be somebody else repeating another's testimony, "Yes, I see
   Him." I like to hear what John saw, but I like better to have John's
   privilege! We shall be like John and shall, ourselves, behold Him. Can
   you realize it? You recollect in Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress how Mercy
   laughed in her sleep, and Christiana asked her what made her laugh so.
   Mercy replied that she had seen a beautiful vision. Is it not enough to
   make us laugh in our sleep, to think that "your eyes shall see the King
   in His beauty"? To think that this head shall wear a crown! That these
   hands shall grasp the palms. That these feet shall stand on the
   transfigured globe. That these ears shall hear the symphonies of
   eternity and that this tongue shall help to swell the everlasting
   chorus! Oh, who would not rejoice? This is the wine which, as it goes
   down, makes the lips of him who drinks to speak. Oh, that we may all
   have a personal sight of the King in His beauty!

   And it will be a near sight, because it will be clear and distinct.
   "Your eyes shall see the King in His beauty." This does not imply a
   distant view of a remote object--a dim vision of the dazzling
   splendor--but you will behold Him in such close proximity that you can
   discern every feature of His Person, every phase of His comeliness! You
   shall discern all the insignia of His offices, His conquests, His
   titles, His dominion and His Glory! Now you only see a picture of Him
   reflected as in a glass, darkly--then you shall see Him face to face!
   Oh, that the curtain might be drawn up, the veil rent, the vision
   unfolded! It will be a delightful sight. When He shall appear in His
   beauty, we cannot wear the vestments of our mourning and sorrow. As He
   is, so are we in this world. As He shall be revealed, so shall we be,
   also, in that world! "It does not yet appear what we shall be, but we
   know that when He shall appear, we shall be like He, for we shall see
   Him as He is." Thus we shall be beautiful when we shall see Him in His
   beauty! He shall say to us, "You are all fair, My love; there is not a
   spot in you." Oh, the delight, the pure unclouded joy, reflective as
   the light of Heaven! What an introduction to eternal happiness this
   will be when your eyes shall see the King in His beauty! There is no
   period, no finale, no end put to it. This is no transient spectacle.
   His beauty never fades. Our festival can never terminate. As long as He
   appears in His beauty we shall see Him and be enamored of His
   loveliness! Is it not written, "Because I live, you shall live also"?
   Without His people, without the complement of His saints with Him, He
   would not be a full Christ at any time. "Know you not that the Church
   is the fullness of Him who fills all in all?" So all His disciples must
   be forever with Him, and they must forever see His face, and be
   partakers of His Glory!

   III. TO WHOM IS THIS VISION GIVEN?

   We find a remarkably full description of these people. Read the 15th
   verse. Their ordinary gait distinguishes them. "He who walks
   righteously." "The pure in heart shall see God." But if your deportment
   disgraces you, how deep will be your dishonor? Unholy creatures will
   never see a holy God! It is not possible! Oh, Sinners, what do you
   think of this? You must be changed! You must be cleansed! You must be
   converted! The Holy Spirit must regenerate you! You must be born-again!
   Otherwise you cannot walk uprightly or stand in the Presence of the
   King in His beauty!

   Next to this they are known by their tongues, "and speaks uprightly."
   No liar shall enter into Heaven. Those who talk lasciviously, those who
   swear profanely, the singers of idle songs, those who lend their lips
   to slander, backbite their neighbors and circulate evil reports in
   malice--these and such as these can have no inheritance in the Kingdom
   of God! Oh, may the Lord wash your tongues, rinse your mouths and make
   them sweet and clean--otherwise you will never sing

   the songs of Heaven. "He who walks righteously and speaks uprightly" is
   so far approved. But let him take heed to his commercial character, for
   it is further said, "He that despises the gain of oppressions," or, as
   the margin has it, of deceit. A man that gets money by squeezing
   others, by oppressing the poor by hard bargains, shall not enjoy the
   Beatific Vision. If you buy and sell, and get gain by lying, by false
   pretences, by tricks of the trade--yes, even by the customs that are
   commonly allowed, though they would look fraudulent if thoroughly
   exposed--you shall have no inheritance in the Kingdom of God! How can
   you be gracious when you are not honest? He that is not able to hold
   the scales lightly, measure out an even yard, or make out a bill
   equitably, may well tremble at being poised in the balances of the
   sanctuary! When such as these are weighed, they will be found wanting.
   Thorough integrity must stand the test of disinterestedness. "He that
   shakes his hands from holding of bribes" Some men cannot help
   preferring coin to conscience. This is the way of bribery. Palm oil was
   largely used when Isaiah wrote. It is still much in vogue--perhaps not
   so much in this country as in others--but there are plenty of ways of
   receiving bribes besides selling one's vote at the polling booth. How
   many men are bribed by a smile or a crown--bribed to
   Sabbath-breaking--bribed to the follies of the world--bribed to I know
   not what of error! But drop a shilling into a conscientious man's hand
   and he shakes it from his hand! He does not like the feel of it. He is
   like Paul, who shook off the viper into the fire. So the man who is to
   see the King in His beauty shakes his hand from holding bribes.
   Moreover, "He stops his ears from hearing of blood" He does not like to
   hear of cruelty, of outrage, or wantonly causing pain. He stops his
   ears--he will not listen to any proposal either to gratify a resentment
   or to seek a personal advantage whereby his neighbor would be injured.
   In this wicked world it is often wise to stop one's ears. A deaf ear is
   a great blessing when there is base conversation in the neighborhood.

   The good man who thus keeps guard over his hands and his feet, his
   tongue and his ears, is likewise known by his eyes. "He shuts his eyes
   from seeing evil." He shuns the temptations to which a vain curiosity
   would expose him. Oh, if only our mother Eve had shut her eyes when the
   serpent pointed out yon rosy apple on the tree! Oh, that she had shut
   her eyes to it! Oh, that she had said, "No, I will not even look at
   it." Looking leads to longing and longing leads to sin. Do you say,
   "There can be no harm in looking, just to see for yourself--are we not
   told to prove all things?" "Just come here, young man," says the
   tempter, "you do not know what life is! One evening will suffice to
   show you a little gaiety and let you see how the frolic is carried on.
   You need not share in it, you know. You may learn a thing or two you
   never dreamed of before. Surely a man is not to go through the world a
   baby--just come for an hour or two and look on!" "Ah, no," says the man
   whose eyes are to see the King in His beauty--"the Tree of Knowledge of
   Good and Evil never brought any man good, yet, so please leave me
   alone! I shut my eyes from the sight of it. I do not want to
   participate, even as a spectator. I do not care to look upon that which
   God will not look upon without abhorrence! I know that His love has put
   my sins behind His back--what, then, He puts behind His back, shall I
   put before my face? That were ingratitude, indeed!" Perhaps you say,
   "Well, if this is the character of such as shall see the King in His
   beauty, I shall never come up to the standard." "No, but you must,
   otherwise you will never enjoy the Beatific Vision." "But I cannot
   convert myself after this fashion." I know you cannot, but there is One
   who can! Has not Jesus Christ come into the world to make us new
   creatures? It is His objective and intent--"Behold, I make all things
   new." He changes a man, gives him new desires, new longings and new
   hopes.

   And He can change you! Let me ask you, have you ever seen, by faith,
   the King? Have you ever looked to Jesus on the Cross and did you ever
   recognize that Jesus Christ, if He is to be your Savior, must be your
   King? You say you have believed in Jesus. Yes, but did you take Him to
   be your King? Did you mean to obeyHim as well as to trust Him? Did you
   intend to serveHim as well as to lean upon Him? Remember, you cannot
   have a half of Christ. You cannot have Him as your Redeemer, but not as
   your Ruler! You must take Him as He is. He is a Savior, but He saves
   His people from their sins. Now, if you have ever seen Christ as your
   Savior, you have seen beauty in Him. He is lovely in your eyes, for the
   loveliest sight in the world to a sinner is His Savior! "What is the
   latest news," said a certain squire to a companion, accustomed to hunt
   with him, who had come up to the Metropolis--"what is the latest news
   you have heard in London?" "The latest news, and the best news I have
   ever heard," was the quick reply, "is that Jesus Christ came into the
   world to save sinners." "Tom," he said, "I do think you are mad!"
   "William," said Tom, "I know you are. I only wish you were cured of
   your insanity as, by the Grace of God, I have been!"

   Oh, that we did but all of us know Jesus Christ in His beauty and
   could, every one of us, rejoice in Him as those do who are charmed by
   the sight! If you have not your eyes opened, you cannot see the King in
   His beauty. But if they are

   opened, now, so that you greet Jesus as your King and see beauty in
   Him, then, whatever your former life may have been, its sins are
   forgiven--they are blotted out! Your Savior's Sacrifice that offered
   such satisfaction to God for your sins shall give sweet solace to your
   conscience. By the gracious help of the Holy Spirit, you shall start a
   fresh career and begin a new life! Be it so and you will henceforth
   shut your eyes from seeing, stop your ears from hearing, shake your
   hands from all iniquity, and turn aside your feet from it to live the
   life you live in the flesh by the faith of the Son of God, to His honor
   and Glory! So shall your eyes, poor Sinner--weeping, sorrowing,
   mournful eyes as they may now be--your eyes shall see the King in His
   beauty! The Lord grant that we, all of us, may have a present earnest
   and a future fruition of this delightful promise, for His name's sake.
   Amen.

Speaking on God's Behalf

   (No. 3543)

   A SERMON PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON.

   "I have yet to speak on God's behalf." Job 36:2.

   So said Elihu. And verily many of us might make the same resolve. We
   have tasted that the Lord is gracious. When first we came to Him laden
   with guilt and full of woes, we found Him ready to pardon--a God with
   whom there is plenteous redemption--

   "Many days have passed since then, Many changes have we seen."

   Still, we have the same tale to tell. God has been faithful to us under
   all circumstances! He has passed by our backslidings. He has been
   patient with all of our shortcomings and He has borne with our
   waywardness. To this day His kindness has not abated, His promise has
   not been forfeited and His Covenant is unbroken--it has never failed
   us. In bounden duty, yet with cheerful gratitude, we are compelled to
   say that the Lord is good and His mercy endures forever! On God's
   behalf, then, we will speak. Much reason have we to do so. While the
   world is scoffing or despising, while some are doubting and others are
   blaspheming. While idolatry and infidelity have their respective
   champions, we will offer our personal testimony in the teeth of all the
   Lord's adversaries. Blessed be His name, He is a faithful and true God,
   and if all the dwellers on earth should belie and forsake Him, His love
   binds us fast! We cannot, neither will we let our trust in Him be
   displaced or our witness to Him be silenced! It seems to me that the
   chief business of a Christian while here below is to speak on God's
   behalf. Why is he placed here? Lower ends or meaner objectives do not
   appear to me to resolve that question. Merely to work, to toil, to
   fulfill his days as a hireling, in common with the rest of his fellow
   creatures, were a poor account to give of a pilgrim bound to the
   heavenly city! Is he not allowed to tarry here that he may glorify his
   God by speaking on His behalf? Are we not, each one of us, appointed to
   linger in these lowlands that we may personally bear witness to what we
   have heard and seen, tasted and handled, tested and proved to be true
   of the good Word of Life? This sacred obligation may be very
   heart-searching to some of you. I am afraid there are dumb tongues that
   do not speak on God's behalf--and which of us can escape a sharp rebuke
   on this score? Those of us who do speak, speak not as we should--we are
   not always giving such evidence and bearing such witness as well
   becomes us on God's behalf.

   I purpose this evening to mention some of the occasions on which we
   have yet to speak on God's behalf. Somepreva-lent excuses for silence.
   Some imperative reasons for bearing testimony. And some pointed
   suggestions to those who feel compelled to open their mouth boldly for
   the honor of God. To my mind, it seems obvious that--

   I. THERE ARE CERTAIN OCCASIONS WHEN EVERY SAVED ONE SHOULD SPEAK ON
   GOD'S BEHALF.

   Is it not peculiarly incumbent upon us immediately after we have found
   peace by putting our trust in the Lord Jesus Christ? He that believes
   with his heart is bound, according to the Gospel rule, to confess also
   with his mouth. Have you heard the good tidings, the way of salvation,
   yourself--believed it and received the fullness of its blessing? Then
   you are forbidden to hide your light under a bushel! You are admonished
   to let it be seen by all that are in the house. You are not, as a
   coward, to conceal your allegiance to your Lord, but you are, as a
   warrior, to put on the King's livery, enter the ranks and join with the
   rest of His people. Is not this the message we are told to circulate,
   "He that believes and is baptized shall be saved"? Should you not,
   therefore, avow your faith and confess your Lord in Baptism? Then,
   having believed His Word and obeyed His precept, take up His Cross as
   one who is dead and buried with Him in the outward type and symbol--to
   follow wherever He leads! This seems to me, as I read the Word of God,
   to have been the course with all the early Christians. They believed
   and were baptized. They did not postpone or procrastinate, but no
   sooner

   were they Christians than they confessed their Christianity in Baptism.
   And why is it not so now? Would God that His people would come back to
   the simple methods of the early Churches and feel that, being saved,
   their next business is to give the answer of a good conscience toward
   God, speaking thus on His behalf, and avowing themselves to be the
   Lord's people!

   This is but a fitting preface to a life of testimony. The whole of a
   Christian's career should be vocal with spiritual power. By the
   indwelling of God the Holy Spirit within him, he should ring out, as it
   were, in silver notes, through all his conversation, both in the Church
   and in the world, a goodly, gracious, grateful testimony--"I have yet
   to speak on God's behalf. Even if I have spoken for the last 20 years,
   it becomes me yet to speak on God's behalf." I may be gray-headed, I
   may lean upon my staff, I may come near the bounds of man's short span
   on this poor stage, "I have yet to speak on God's behalf." Even when
   pillows hold up my aching head and when my flesh and my heart are
   failing--until the pulse of life shall flag and the power of speech
   shall fail--our witness to the sons of men must never falter, much less
   must it come to an ignoble end. "I have yet to speak." When first I
   knew Him I was compelled to speak. Would that every converted man was
   moved instantly to avow his Lord! But if we have anything to regret in
   the past, let us not be hesitant now. Say it, resolve it, yes, vow it!
   I have and I shall have yet to speak on God's behalf till speech shall
   fail me, till, dying, "I clasp my Savior in my arms, the antidote of
   death."

   And oh, how specially bound the Christian is to speak on God's behalf
   when he is cast among ungodly men and women! There may be in the house
   where you live no lover of Jesus except yourself. Take care that your
   conversation makes the rest know that you have been with Jesus and have
   learned of Him! There is no other candle in the house--oh, put not the
   extinguisher on that one! You are the only salt--take care that you are
   sprinkled over the mass. Let the savor of your walk and conversation be
   diffused among your associates! At times the name of Christ will be
   blasphemed, perhaps, in your presence. Or it may be unholy and even
   lewd conversation will assail your ears. It is for you to express your
   displeasure at anything which is displeasing to Him you serve! You must
   put in a word, though you do but feebly thrust it in edgeways, for the
   Christ whom ungodly tongues are slandering! You may not sit still and
   hear your best Friend evilly spoken of--that were ungrateful in the
   extreme! Well might He say, "Is this your kindness to your Friend?"
   Should you smile, they will think you are amused, but if you laugh with
   them over an unholy jest, they would say you enjoyed it! "You also were
   as one of them" was a charge made against a professor. Oh, let it never
   be laid against any of us! If we see our neighbor sin and rebuke him
   not when the opportunity offers, we become partakers in his sin.
   Remember this--on such occasions it is our bounden duty to speak on
   God's behalf!

   Yet again, we meet with Brothers and Sisters in affliction. They are
   mourning and bemoaning themselves and their hardships. God's own people
   commonly find that in all their trials they are beset with temptations.
   How apt they are to speak unadvisedly because they think untowardly of
   the order of God's Providence and the manner of His love! I wish this
   ill condition of the heart and this bad habit of the lips were less
   prevalent than unhappily it is. They talk as if they served a hard
   Master and they murmur as if His Providence were peculiarly severe
   towards them. I beseech you, seize the propitious moment to speak on
   God's behalf! Daughter of poverty! You who have known the pinch of
   want, tell of the faithfulness of God that supported you! Child of
   pain! You who have tossed so long upon a bed of affliction, changing
   your posture over and over till your bones began to peep through your
   skin, tell, you patient sufferers--and there are many of you whose
   pangs are smart, whose wounds are incurable--tell how God has succored
   you! Be not silent, you who have gone through fire and water, the
   furnace and the flood! Testify, you fathers in the Church, and you
   mothers in Israel speak on God's behalf of the goodness, the guidance
   and the Grace you have had. Do not let the young recruits entertain
   hard thoughts of your Lord and Master! Tell them that the battle of
   life, stern though it is, does not baffle His counsel or His care. He
   who has upheld you will bear them through ten thousand billows, keep
   them alive in the midst of afflictions fiery as a furnace seven times
   heated--and even to the end will prove that He is their gracious God!
   You have yet to speak on God's behalf.

   Now, Brothers and Sisters, some of you may not only have so to speak in
   the chambers where the afflicted are confined, and in the Sunday School
   where the little children come round your knee, and in your own
   families and workshops, but you may have a call to speak in the open
   streets, or in the pulpits of our sanctuaries. I pray you, then, if you
   have ability for such work in this day of blasphemy and rebuke, stand
   not back! I am persuaded that some of my Brothers look for greater
   talents, before they can speak for Christ, than they have a right to
   expect at the first. If none are permit-

   ted to speak on God's behalf but those who have ten talents, surely the
   Kingdom of God must be deeply indebted to the education and scholarship
   of learned men! But if I read this Word aright, it is not so. Rather
   has it pleased God to take weak and foolish things to confound the
   mighty and the wise. Therefore, let not the Brother of low degree keep
   back his testimony. If you can only say a few good words, say them! Who
   would withhold a few drops of moisture from the flowers in the garden
   because he had no plenteous streams at his command? Should every
   twinkling star cease its shining because it was not a sun, the
   night--how dark! The firmament--how bereft of its beauty! Did each drop
   of rain refuse to fall because it was but a drop, we would lack the
   goodly showers which cheer the thirsty soil! Do what you can if you
   cannot do what you would, for you, even you, have yet to speak on God's
   behalf! And, perhaps, you have more talent than you think--a little
   exercise might bring out your latent powers. Men grow not up to man's
   estate in a week or a year. Rome was not built in a day. How can you
   expect to be qualified to serve your God with much success unless you
   are trained with drill and discipline? If you begin to walk, or even to
   crawl on all fours, you may afterwards learn to run. Be content to use
   such powers as you have to the utmost of your ability, for He has said,
   "I will never leave you nor forsake you." Do not reserve your strength,
   but consecrate all you have, "for He gives more Grace. " Diligently
   cultivate every faculty, knowing that He gives Grace upon Grace. "I
   have yet to speak on God's behalf."

   I know not whether I am just now like the seraph who flew with a live
   coal, bearing it in the tongs from off the altar, to touch some lips,
   to put it to anyone's mouth, and say, "Lo, this has touched your lips."
   It may be so. Some child of God, up to now dumb, may be called
   henceforth to speak for his Master. If you now hear a voice saying,
   "Who will go for Us? Whom shall We send?" Let your answer be, "Here am
   I, send me." Respond, in the words of our text, "I have yet to speak on
   God's behalf." Turn we now to--

   II. THOSE ARGUMENTS WHICH READILY SUGGEST THEMSELVES TO SOME MINDS FOR
   KEEPING SILENCE.

   Have I yet to speak on God's behalf? "No," says one, "pardon me, but
   speaking out for God cannot be accounted essential to salvation. Are
   there not some who come, like Nicodemus, by night? May there not be
   many Believers in Jesus who have not the courage to speak out of the
   fullness of their heart? Why should not I be one of these secret
   Believers, and yet enter into Heaven?" You think to go to the Celestial
   City by a by-road, unseen and unnoticed, hoping to be safe at the last.
   Suppose it true that to avow your faith is not absolutely essential to
   salvation--I ask you if it is not absolutely essential to obedience?
   And I ask again if obedience is not essential to every Believer as a
   vindication of his faith? Though you may tell me that there are many
   secret Believers, I venture to affirm that you never knew one, or if
   you think you did, the secret must have been ill kept if you knew it!
   Obviously, if it was a genuine secret, it must have been beyond your
   understanding, or mine either, so we cannot fairly argue about it. And
   as we do not know that such a thing ever was, we have no fact to build
   upon. Surely to someone or other that gracious secret must have been
   made known, or what you tried to conceal someone would have found out.
   I should think if your Christian character and conduct were not
   palpable, your Christianity could scarcely be sterling! Who can conceal
   fire in his bosom? Will it not sooner or later break out? The more
   wicked the persons by whom you are surrounded, the more readily will
   they discover the difference between a Christian and themselves. You
   can scarcely conceal the Light of God--it must reveal itself. Why,
   therefore, should you attempt to hide it? Merely to do what is
   absolutely necessary for salvation is a mean, selfish thing! To be
   always thinking about whether this or that is necessary to your being
   saved--is this how you would show your allegiance to the Savior? Should
   the self-denial of our blessed Lord and Master be requited with the
   selfishness of followers who are always muttering, "Cui bond?. What
   profit can I make of His service?" Oh, that we may be delivered from
   such an ungenerous disposition! Knowing that Christ has done so much
   for us and feeling the compelling power of love, may we rejoice to
   serve Him, whether the service shall be grateful to our taste, or
   mortifying to our pride! And in so doing, we shall soon find that in
   keeping His Commandments there is great reward!

   "But do you happen to be of a very retiring disposition?" A beautiful
   disposition that is, I have no doubt, and rare enough in some select
   circles to claim admiration, but undesirable, indeed, on some
   particular fields at some critical junctures. For a soldier, when the
   battle is raging, to be of a retiring disposition would be neither
   patriotic nor praiseworthy. Had this dainty temper been the main virtue
   of the hosts from where British heroes leapt forth, the trumpet of fame
   had long since ceased to resound the deeds of prowess of which every
   Englishman is proud! A soldier of Christ may well

   be modest in estimating himself, but he had need be mighty in serving
   his Lord. If he is too modest to avow his Master, this shameless
   modesty betrays a cowardly spirit, at which his comrades well might
   shudder--

   "Ashamed of Jesus? That dear Friend On whom my hopes of Heaven depend?
   No! When I blush, be this my shame, That I no more revere His name."

   Ashamed of Jesus? Really, the words seem so harsh that they imply an
   insult! Yet this beautiful, retiring disposition, when translated out
   of the fine words in which you wrap it up, means nothing more nor less
   than a disloyalty which verges hard on treason! Ashamed of Jesus, who
   shed His blood for you? Ah, you must all confess that there is no
   violation of genuine modesty in avowing one's intense attachment and
   allegiance to the Lord Jesus Christ! This may be true retirement, after
   all, for you may renounce, thereby, the world's praises, repudiate her
   honors, bring upon yourself her loudest censure and be requited with
   the cold shoulder by your companions when you take up your cross and
   follow Him.

   But have I not often heard persons says, "Why should I speak on God's
   behalf, when already some who do speak are hypocrites?" This seems to
   me a reason why you should speak twice as much in order to counteract
   their false testimo-ny--and why you should speak with all the more
   carefulness and integrity, making their example a beacon, lest you fall
   into the same condemnation! If a friend of mine has an enemy who is a
   snake in the grass, pretending kindness while he is plotting mischief,
   am I, therefore, to say, "I will forsake my friend, and not acknowledge
   him, because another is a traitor to him"? Such reasoning would refute
   itself! Let us not, therefore, delude ourselves with its subtlety. The
   more hypocrites there are, the more need of honest men to grasp the
   banner of the Cross! The more deceivers, the more cause why the
   faithful and the true should come and fill up the ranks--and prevent
   the battle being turned over to the enemy!

   Or do you hesitate to speak for God because you are afraid your
   testimony would be so very feeble But why disquiet yourselves on this
   ground? Are not all great things the aggregate of little things? And
   may there not be something great involved in the motion of the little?
   A good word from your tongue may kindle a thought or a series of
   thoughts which may issue in the conversion of one whose eloquence shall
   shake the nation! You emit but a spark, but what a conflagration it may
   cause, Heaven only knows! What though you seem tiny and insignificant
   as the coral insect, yet if you do your fair share of the work with
   your fellows, you may help to pile up an island that shall be abundant
   in fertility and adorned with beauty. You are not called upon to do
   anything that exceeds your power or your skill. It is enough that you
   do what you can. God requires not according to what a man has not, but
   according to what a man has. Therefore, let it be no excuse for your
   silence that you cannot speak with a voice of thunder.

   "But," says one, "were I to open my mouth on God's behalf, I should
   feel ever afterwards a weight of responsibility from which I could not
   escape. A man of God standing by that pool not many weeks ago said to
   me, "I dare not be baptized, though I believe it is a Scriptural
   ordinance, because I feel that it involves such a solemn profession. I
   would never be able to live up to it." My reply to him was. "Is not
   that the very reason why you should yield up yourself to God at
   once--for the more we feel bound to holiness, the better?" "Your vows
   are upon me." Should the profession of our faith in Christ become a
   restriction to us, it need not be regretted on that account. We need
   such restrictions! If we shall feel bound to be more precise, we serve
   a precise God--and if we feel bound to be more jealous, we serve a
   jealous God. I like to see men put upon their mettle. Members of this
   Church, whenever the world picks holes in your coat and watches you, I
   am thankful to the world for doing so! It is good for our welfare to
   have an eagle eye upon us. What though Argus uses all his eyes, let us
   only be what we should be, and we need not mind who criticized or carps
   at us! If we are not what we ought to be, but mere hypocrites, then, in
   truth, we may well wish to be hidden! Confess the name of Jesus, become
   a true follower in His blessed footsteps and walk with all humility and
   carefulness as His Grace shall enables you, worthy of your high
   calling! Be bold to confess His name all the more! Certainly none the
   less because such confession will lay you under solemn obligations to
   live nearer to Him than before!

   Still, I can imagine that there are many here who are using some excuse
   or other, which they would not like to mention. They say they will wait
   a little--they will tarry awhile. Others say nothing, but are simply
   neglecting the duty. Well, I will not stay to argue with them, but I
   will rather pray that God the Holy Spirit may convince them, if they
   have been quickened from their spiritual death and are this day heirs
   of God, to face their incumbent duty and their blessed privilege in all
   ways--and on all prudent opportunities to speak on God's behalf. But
   there are--

   III. VALID REASONS WHY WE SHOULD SPEAK ON GOD'S BEHALF, to which I will
   now draw your attention.

   Surely it is demanded of all Believers. We are bidden to confess with
   the mouth if we have believed with the heart. We have, moreover, the
   promise that, "he that with his heart believes, and with his mouth
   confesses, shall be saved." And this likewise, "He that confesses Me
   before men, him will I confess before My Father who is in Heaven." The
   alternative is fraught with judgment--"He that denies Me"--which
   signifies a non-confession--"he that denies Me before men, him will I
   deny before My Father which is in Heaven." If it is, then, the Lord's
   will, it is at your peril that you forget or neglect it! "He that knows
   his Master's will, and does it not, shall be beaten with many stripes."
   Hasten, then, you backward Christian! Make haste and delay not to keep
   this Commandment! Be convinced that you have yet to speak on God's
   behalf.

   Be assured that such testimony as you can and ought to bear would be a
   great comfort to the Lord's people. You do not know, some of you saved
   ones who have never confessed your faith, what pleasure it would give
   the minister. I know of no joy comparable to that of hearing that one
   has been made the instrument of the conversion of a soul. It keeps our
   spirits up and our Master knows that we have good need, sometimes, of
   some success to encourage us. He who thinks that the Christian ministry
   is an easy post--exempt from care and free and from trials--had better
   try it. It were better to be a galley-slave, chained to the oar, than
   to be a minister of the Gospel, if it were not for the strong
   consolations which support us in the present--and for the Divine reward
   which there will be at the last. He who diligently discharges this
   solemn vocation never knows rest or release from anxiety. His mind is
   always actively exercised in his Master's service. His heart bears
   about a load which it cannot shake off. He dreams of some who walk
   disorderly--and wakes to sigh and cry over others who grow cold or
   lukewarm. He must plow the stony ground and he can but regret the loss
   of his seed. He scatters the good seed on the way, and if it come not
   up, by-and-by, according to the promise, he cries, "Who has believed
   our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" As cold
   water to a thirsty soul, so would the news be of your conversion! You
   saved ones ought, for that reason, to speak on God's behalf!

   And how encouraging it is to the entire Church! In the Church assembly
   I am sure we often have simple music that is more thrilling than any of
   the anthems in your cathedrals. There is joyful melody in our hearts
   before the Lord when we hear of a broken-hearted penitent finding
   peace, of an outcast reclaimed from the wilds, an outrageous sinner led
   into paths of obedience and holiness! Even the angels account this to
   be rare music to be mightily relished. I believe they strike their
   golden harps to nobler melody when they learn that prodigals have
   sought their Father's face! You have yet to speak on God's behalf for
   His Church's sake, that she may be encouraged!

   Greatly, too, does it behoove you to speak on God's behalf, for the
   sake of the undecided. Some of them would probably be fully persuaded
   if they saw your example. How many people there are in the world who
   are led by the influence that others exert over them! Thousands have
   been brought to Jesus just as those early disciples, of whom we read,
   that Andrew followed Jesus, and presently brought his own brother,
   Simon, to Jesus. Or Philip, who, after being found of Jesus, finds
   Nathanael and tells him and draws him to the Savior. We can all exert
   an influence of some kind--let us tell what God has worked in us and
   many a one who halts between two opinions may, by Divine Grace, be
   induced to cast in his lot with the people of God!

   Look on the great outlying world. What a mass of creatures whose lives
   must prove a blessing or a curse Will you not speak on God's behalf for
   their sakes? Do you not feel compelled to bear your testimony against
   their neglect, their waywardness and their willful disobedience of the
   great Father? With habitual negligence and constant forgetfulness, they
   slight Him who never forgets them, Him who, with unslumbering eyes,
   watches for their good! Lay this to heart, my Brothers and Sisters, and
   come out, I pray you! Be you separate, touch not the unclean thing! You
   have your Father's promise that He will be a Father to you and you
   shall be His children. You are not of the world, even as Christ is not
   of the world--why, then, should you seek to remain mingled with the
   world in name? Be distinct and separate! Take up your cross daily and
   follow your Master.

   For your own sake, too, I would venture to press this upon any of you
   who are backward in avowing your faith. You cannot conceive what
   blessing it would bring you were you distinctly and persistently to
   speak for Jesus! That timidity which now embarrasses you would speedily
   cease to check your zeal. After you had once openly professed Christ,
   gifts that now slumber unconsciously to yourself would be developed by
   exercise. Rich comfort the service of God would then

   bring you! Were you ever to win a soul for Jesus, you would be happier
   than the merchantman when he found the goodly pearl! You would think
   that all the happiness you ever knew before was less than nothing
   compared with the joy of saving a soul from death and rescuing a sinner
   from going down into the pit of Hell! Oh, the bliss of speaking a word
   that affects three worlds, making a change in Heaven, earth and Hell,
   as devils grind their teeth in wrath because one of their victims is
   snatched out of their jaws--as men on earth wonder and admire the
   change that Grace has worked--and as angels rejoice when they hear of
   sinners saved!

   For the sake of Him who bought you with His precious blood, seek out
   others who have been redeemed at the same inestimable price! For the
   sake of that blessed Spirit who brought you to Jesus and who now moves
   in you that you may move others to come to Jesus, be up and doing,
   steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
   forasmuch as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord! You
   have yet to speak on God's behalf, and these are the motives that ought
   to move you. And now let me close with--

   IV. ONE OR TWO SUGGESTIONS.

   Should you feel, dear Friends, that you ought to speak on God's
   behalf--and I hope you do feel it--whether Brothers in public ministry,
   or Sisters in the privacy of social circles, I would counsel you,
   before you begin to speak, to seek of God guidance as to how you shall
   speak on His behalf. There are better words spoken of by the ignorant
   when they wait upon God, than by the wise when they speak out of their
   own heads. It is wonderful to read the answers which some of the
   martyrs gave to their accusers. Think of that woman, Anne Askew, how,
   after being racked and tortured, she nonplussed the priests. It is
   really marvelous to read how she overcame them. And there was my Lord
   Mayor of London-- what a fool she made of him! He put to her this
   question--"Woman, if a mouse were to eat the blessed sacrament which
   contains the body and blood of Christ, what do you think would become
   of it?" "My lord," she answered, "that is a deep question. I had rather
   you would answer it yourself. My Lord Mayor, what do you think would
   become of the mouse that should do that," "I verily believe" said the
   Lord Mayor, whose ears must have been preternaturally long, "I verily
   believe the mouse would be damned!" And what said Anne Askew? Why, what
   could she reply better than this, "Alas, poor mouse." Often a few short
   words--three or four words--have met the case when the martyrs have
   waited upon God! And they have made their adversaries seem so
   ridiculous that I think they might hear a laugh both from Heaven and
   Hell at once at their foolery, for God's servants have convicted them
   of folly and put them to shame! Ask what you should say, particularly
   when men would wrest your words, and when they would catch you in the
   speech. Be like your Master some-times--stoop down and write on the
   ground--wait a while. Sometimes a question is best answered by another
   question. Ask your Master to teach you that rhetoric which confuses men
   who would catch you in your speech.

   And if you seek the conversion of others, especially remember that it
   is words from God's mouth rather than words from your mouth that will
   effect it. Ask the Master, for He knows how to draw the bow when you
   cannot. You might draw it at a venture, but He can draw at a certainty,
   so that the arrows shall surely pierce between the joints of the armor.
   Here is a prayer for every man and woman that has to speak for
   Jesus--"Open my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Your praise."

   And look to the Holy Spirit, that He would bless what He directs you to
   say. It were better to speak five words by the promptings of the Holy
   Spirit than to utter whole volumes without His guidance. Better be
   filled with silent musings by the blessed Spirit of God than pour forth
   floods of words and sentences, however pleasant, without His influence.
   There is an irresistible power about the man who has an unction from
   the Holy One which Demosthenes or Pericles, Cicero or Socrates, never
   dreamed of! Put the man up to speak to his fellow men who is endowed
   with this mysterious power and he will make hearts of stone melt and
   force a way for the Truth of God through gates of brass and bars of
   triple steel! Where the Divine Witness attests the word spoken, there
   is a majesty in the simplest utterances that carries conviction to the
   heart, while it makes Satan and all his Myrmidons tremble! Seek for
   this might. Tarry at Jerusalem till you are endowed with power from on
   high and thenspeak boldly on God's behalf! Wherever your calling may
   be, and whenever your opportunity shall arise, speak as one whose heart
   has been enlarged, as one whose mouth has been opened, as one who is
   filled with the Spirit!

   Very earnestly would I caution you young Christians not to put off or
   delay speaking, otherwise you will lack the facility you might quickly
   attain by habitually attending to it. An aptitude for speaking to
   people one by one is very desirable. I know some Brothers in the
   ministry whom I greatly envy for the possession of a talent which I do
   not possess in the

   same proportion as they do. The genius of conversation so sanctified
   that one can be personal and yet prudent--plain and pointed, yet withal
   pleasant--administering a rebuke without endangering a rebuff, winning
   a man's confidence while wounding his pride and commending the Gospel
   by the courteousness with which it is stated--that is a power of
   utterance to be emulated by us all! We are too apt to be ambitious of
   speaking to the many and oblivious of the talking power that can deftly
   speak to a friend. Begin early, then, after your conversion to speak,
   one by one, with your kinsfolk and acquaintances! Keep up the practice.
   Should you find yourselves getting sluggish, so that it becomes irksome
   to you, seek unto the Lord, confess your sin before Him. The tact of
   speaking to individuals is worth all the study and attention you can
   bestow upon it. Ask for wisdom and prudence to know when to speak and
   how to speak! It is not every fisherman who can catch fish. There is a
   knack about it and so there is about speaking for Christ. There is a
   suitable time and there is a suitable way. Why, there are some people
   who, if they were to try to speak for Christ, would do mischief! They
   have got such forbidding faces, such ungainly manners, such a coarse
   way of expressing themselves, that in spite of good intentions, they
   rather hinder than help. They expect to catch their flies with vinegar,
   but they will never succeed or be able to do it. If they could learn to
   be kind and genial, affable and sympathetic, they would be far more
   likely to succeed. There are men who put the Truth of God in such a
   shape that it looks like a lie. There are other men who do a good deal
   with so little delicacy that they affront those they intend to oblige.
   Do let us learn, when we speak for God, to speak in the best possible
   manner, exercising all the Christian Graces! Of our blessed Lord it was
   said, "Never man spoke like this Man." Of us who are His humble
   followers, may it be observed that we have been with Jesus, and have
   learned of Him.

   God grant you, Believers all, Grace to speak for God! And you
   unbelievers, may you be brought to trust the Master and to love Him,
   and then speak for Him! And His be the praise, though yours the profit!
   Amen.

The Only Road

   (No. 3544)

   PUBLISHED ON THURSDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1916.

   DELIVERED BY C. H. SPURGEON,

   AT THE METROPOLITAN TABERNACLE, NEWINGTON, ON THE LORD'S-DAY EVENING,
   MARCH 31, 1872.

   "Jesus said to Him, I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man comes
   to the Father but by Me." John 14:6.

   JESUS had been speaking about the Father, about His going to the
   Father, about the Father's house and about going there. And He was
   asked by Thomas this question, "We know not where You are going, and
   how can we know the way?" We are to understand this verse as being an
   answer to that question. He tells him where He was going, namely, to
   the Father, and also the way to the Father, namely, by Himself.

   Now this verse has been read and read, too, with a great deal of
   profit, without always being read correctly. For instance, suppose I
   were to divide my sermon into three parts, tonight, and show that,
   first, Christ is the way? Secondly, that He is the truth? And thirdly,
   that He is the life? I do not think I should be able to give you the
   meaning of the text, for you will observe that He is not speaking about
   three things--He does not say, "I am the way, and the truth, and the
   life"--He is speaking about only one thing, namely, that He is the way,
   and then the two words, truth and the life, are put in to explain what
   He means by the way. So I think.

   Luther, taking the first meaning and putting in an, "and," for it is
   necessary to put one in to make it out, says Christ is the way, that
   is, through Him men begin to be Christians. Secondly, He is the truth,
   that is, through Him they are instructed further in the faith. Thirdly,
   He is the life, that is, through Him they enter into eternal
   blessedness in the life to come.

   Now it is very true, but it is not the Truth of God taught here--at
   least, we think not, certainly if we follow the strict analogy of the
   language. Augustine read the passage this way, "I am the way, the true
   way and the living way." But that is not quite it. There is truth in
   that and it is more correct than Luther's reading--but we cannot see
   the sense without some considerable violation of the language. It is
   true, but not the Truth of God taught here.

   What we want to do is not only to preach about the Truth of God, but
   the Truth of God that is in our text. It appears to us that this was
   our Lord's meaning--"I am the way to God." That is the great
   teaching--"No man comes to the Father but by Me and I am the way in
   this respect--that no man can come to know the truth with regard to the
   Father except He knows Me as the truth. And, secondly, no man can
   possess the life by which He comes to the Father except He receives Me
   as the life. I am the way to the Father in a double sense--of being the
   truth which teaches men about the Father and being the life which
   enables men to come to the Father and have practical communion."

   Believing that to be the meaning of the text, we will try and work it
   out. First, then, Christ is the way to the Father as He is the truth.
   Secondly, He is the way to the Father as He is the life. And, thirdly,
   taking the general statement with which the verse closes, He is
   altogether and in all respects the only way to the Father--"No man
   comes to the Father, but by Me."

   To begin, then--I. CHRIST IS THE WAY TO THE FATHER SO FAR AS HE IS THE
   TRUTH. He is so in this respect--nobody knows the Father until, first
   of all, He knows Jesus Christ. God the Father is to be seen in Nature.
   He has painted every flower and He it is that hangs every blade of
   grass with the glistening pearl of dew. But so dim are our eyes and,
   after all, so little of the more spiritual parts of His Character could
   God reveal in mere materialism, that man does not behold God there. We
   are often told that we are to go from Nature up to Nature's God--just
   about as easy to go from the higher pinnacle of the Alps to the stars!
   The step is too long for human nature. Men have never taken it. Those
   men of old who ransacked Nature--the old philosophers and teachers of
   the heathen--did not discover God. "The world, by wisdom, knew not
   God."

   Oh, what a maze of deities they had--what strange gods! What strange
   characters they gave to God! Our very chil-dren--in their classical
   learning in schools, get their minds polluted by reading the deeds of
   beings that were called gods among the heathens. If a man does not form
   the same false conception of God the ancient heathen did, it is partly
   to be accounted for by the almost unconscious effect of Christianity
   upon men's minds! Men cannot form such ideals of God living in England
   as they could, living in Greece, before the Gospel had been preached
   there--yet every idea of God that is not drawn by men from Revelation
   and is not brought to men through Jesus Christ, the Mediator, is sure
   to be a false one, a lopsided one--an ideal of God in which some one
   virtue preponderates to the destruction of others. It is not God at
   all! It is a gross caricature of God. It is, in fact, no more God that
   men think out by reason than the golden calf was God which came out of
   the fire when Aaron had thrust gold into it. They did not know God.

   You have only to take up the works of any of our great original
   thinkers who scorn to call themselves Christians, and though you will
   see that Christianity has molded their thought, you will only see truth
   so far as it has done that, unconsciously, to themselves. But where you
   get their real thoughts and reasonings, you will find that they have
   not come to the Father because they have neglected the great Truth of
   God which is in Christ, which is the way to the great Truths which are
   in God the Father.

   Now while this is true with regard to the Person of the Father,
   Himself, let me remind you, in the next place, that it is true with
   regard to everything about the Father. Now there is one doctrine in
   Scripture which is peculiar to the Father. It is the doctrine of
   Election. The Father has chosen us to be His people. Everywhere in
   Scripture it is put down as the work of the First Person of the blessed
   Trinity--to choose a people to Himself that shall show forth His
   praise. Now there are many persons who want to get at that doctrine. I
   have known many unconverted people want to understand it. I frequently
   get letters from persons troubled about it. They say that they should
   feel peace if they could understand that doctrine.

   But, beloved Friends, if any such are here tonight, I will speak to
   them. You cannot get to Election--you cannot get to the Father by a
   direct road from where you are. Just read that signpost. "No man comes
   to the Father but by Christ." If, then, you want to understand
   election, begin with Redemption! You will never understand the eternal
   choice till you begin at the Cross. Begin with this, "God was in
   Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their
   trespasses unto them." Do not begin at the 9th of Romans. You had much
   better begin at the 3rd of John, "Like as Moses lifted up the serpent
   in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that
   whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

   You will be worrying yourself, bothering your poor head and tormenting
   your poor heart for many years if you try to get to the Father first!
   Your business is to take God's Law and rule--and go to the Son upon the
   Cross, first--and then to the Father upon His Throne. It would be a
   strange thing if our children would insist upon going to the University
   before they went to grammar school. They would never learn anything in
   that way because the studies of the University are too severe for them
   until, first of all, they have gone to preparatory schools. It were an
   odd thing, indeed, if every man that took down his Bible, should always
   begin it backwards and read Revelation first--and if every man read the
   Lord's Prayer beginning at, "Amen," and went backward to, "Our Father!"

   Yet some minds will persist in this. There is a charm to them about the
   mystery of Sovereignty and Election, and they must begin with that.
   Little children, why must you first eat strong meat? Here is milk for
   you--be satisfied with your milk! It will strengthen you. You shall
   have the strong meat, by-and-bye, when, by reason of use, your senses
   have been exercised! Listen to Christ's tender words, "No man comes to
   the Father but by Me." There is no way to Election except through
   Redemption.

   And now, another illustration of the same Truth of God. Even the
   Fatherhood of God is known only in Christ. This is what is mainly
   intended in this verse. It is not known as a Truth of God, till, first
   of all, we know the Truth concerning Christ. And the Truth concerning
   Jesus, the First-Born and elder Brother, is the way to learn the truth
   concerning the entire family. What a muddle there is made in this world
   about the Fatherhood of God. According to some, we are, all of us, all
   alike His children and He must be, indeed, a strange Father if His
   dealings with the sons of men are to be considered as the dealings of a
   Father.

   Indeed, we can very well understand why some have said, "How can we
   account for this pit of Hell?" Would a father put his children there?
   Certainly he would not. And if God is a Father to all mankind, alike,
   and in the same sense, then

   it would be utterly unaccountable that there should be any eternal
   destruction from the Presence of the Lord. But this fatherhood is a
   fiction, a sheer and clear fiction--an invention of modern times! There
   is another fatherhood in which God is the Father of the twice-born, the
   Father of the regenerate. The God and Father of our Lord and Savior
   Jesus Christ and, next of all, those who are in Jesus Christ. And when
   you come to know Christ as the Son--and yourself as one with Him--then
   you begin to know what the Fatherhood of God means in its specialty to
   the elect, in its truth, in its depth and in its blessed outflow--that,
   being a Father, He chastens us, He loves us, feeds us, guides us,
   trains us, educates us and provides for us an inheritance which none
   shall ever be able to take from us!

   I venture to say it here, again, that no man knows anything in truth
   about the Fatherhood of God till he knows something about union with
   Christ--his own sonship by virtue of his brotherhood with Jesus. No man
   comes to the Father but through the Son!

   And now I shall take another point of the same great Truth of God. It
   is commonly thought that anybody can understand the mercy of God--at
   any rate, we can get to it. But, Beloved, an infinite deal of mischief
   has been created in this world by a mistaken notion about mercy with
   regard to God--that God is not very particular about our sins, that He
   does not judge us too severely, that He knows we are tempted a great
   deal--that we have strong passions and, therefore, He winks at it all
   and, notwithstanding that we are not what we ought to be, yet He will
   graciously overlook it and accept us. That is the common notion of
   God's mercy, but there is nothing whatever in Holy Scripture to support
   it--there is no grain of evidence that such mercy as that is in the
   heart of God at all!

   The Lord is angry with the wicked every day! He hates sin, even a
   single sin! He will by no means spare the wicked. He neither closes His
   eyes against sin, nor will He stay His hand from the punishment of sin.
   No man comes to the Father's mercy till He has learnt Christ! But when
   you come to Jesus Christ--and you understand that God took His Son from
   His bosom and put Him to death in our place that He might have mercy
   upon us without the violation of His jus-tice--when we see how He made
   Christ to be our Substitute, in order that He might freely and fully
   forgive--then we see what kind of mercy God's mercy is! It is not mercy
   to the sin--He punished that--it is mercy to the sinner! It is not
   mercy that thinks little of sin, for He put His Son to death when sin
   was laid upon Him! It is not mercy that winks at sin and treats it as
   though it were a trifle, for He made His Son cry out, "Why have You
   forsaken Me?" It is a kind of mercy that is consistent with the
   fiercest wrath against every particle of iniquity! The Lord is a
   consuming fire and will by no means spare the guilty! Every
   transgression shall have its recompense of reward.

   But yet He is a "God merciful and gracious, passing by transgression,
   iniquity, and sin," and this you can only know the meaning of when you
   know Christ as the Truth of God that conducts you to the great Truth of
   the mercy of God! Equally, the same remark might be made upon God's
   justice, but I shall not tarry upon that. I shall rather close these
   observations upon this first head by saying that we do not truly know
   the power and dominion of God till we, first of all, know Christ. We
   may know God to be Omnipotent. We may understand that He does as He
   wills, but that Truth, in its real force, never breaks upon the soul
   till it shines through the Mediator! I am alarmed to think of God's
   greatness. I am afraid when I think of His supremacy. I know that He
   can do as He wills and yet I rebel! I know that He can punish me, that
   He can crush me--and I tremble in His Presence--but I feel no love to
   Him until I see His love to me in the Person of His dear Son.

   And then, in a moment, I bless Him, for He is Omnipotent, and I can see
   His Omnipotence on all sides. I bless Him that He is the King! Let the
   children of Zion be joyful in the King. I thank Him that He does as He
   wills. I rejoice that He does, for He only wills to do that which is
   for the good of His own chosen ones. You cannot love God in any one of
   His attributes, or know Him aright and truly unless it is through first
   knowing Jesus Christ!

   Beloved, then let me say to you, gathering all up in one--you will do
   serious mischief to yourselves if you study any Truth concerning God
   apart from Jesus Christ. Luther was quite right when he said, "I will
   have nothing to do with an absolute god. I will not try to study him as
   god. I know that I cannot look at the sun; I must have a smoked glass
   to look through--I must have the Person of the God-Man to take away the
   blinding Glory of the invisible God--invisible because too bright for
   my eyes to gaze upon. You must have God in Christ. I will not try to
   study anything else."

   Our preaching, if we do not preach Christ, is useless! We may preach
   what we like about the Father, what we like about portions of
   Scripture--but if there is no Christ, there will be no good come of it.
   Somebody once said, "Why is it that the Methodists and others get
   people to hear them and they have conversions, but you do not find
   crowds go to hear

   Unitarians, neither do you hear of conversions?" And somebody said,
   "There is no blood in the Unitarian religion and the blood is the very
   life of it." Leave out the atoning Sacrifice and you have left out the
   marrow from the bones, and the bones from the body! The fabric becomes
   soft, weak, powerless, yes, you have left out the very soul of the
   Gospel if you leave out Christ, the Mediator, Christ, the Surety,
   Christ, the Atonement, Christ suffering in our place! As our preaching
   ought to be full of Christ, so let your studies of Scripture be!

   Read everything in the light of Christ! Calvinism I believe in, but not
   Calvinism without Christ--it becomes fatalism then. I am thankful to
   hear the practical preacher who preaches the precepts, but I do not
   believe in his preaching without Christ. He will get into legal bondage
   as sure as he is a man. The one thing that will keep preaching alive is
   to keep Christ in it--Christ at the top, Christ at the bottom, Christ
   in the middle and Christ all the way through! Many a man's theology is
   a very gold pot of ointment, but there is a nasty fly in it that will
   make it stink--and there is nothing that will get the stinking fly out
   of the ointment but Christ--He keeps our theology sweet and pure. We do
   not know Christ, Himself, nor anything about Him to any saving and
   practical purpose, except in that way. The Truth of God that is in
   Christ is the way by which we get to the Truth concerning God.

   And now we shall pass on to the second point.

   II. CHRIST IS THE WAY TO THE FATHER AS HE IS THE LIFE. We get life
   through Him--then we come to

   God. But we are dead till we get Christ--and God is not the God of the
   dead, but of the living! We are dead, I say, till we get Christ and the
   place of the dead is on the earth--not in Heaven. Bury the dead out of
   my sight, corruption cannot inherit the Kingdom of God! Now observe we
   never come to God till first we get life enough in Christ to have Him
   as a hope of pardon. I never dared think of coming to God till, first
   of all, I saw that He had laid help upon One that is mighty, even upon
   Christ Jesus. When I understood that the only-begotten Son of God
   became Man for the sinner's sake and suffered in the sinner's place,
   then I thought, "There is hope for me."

   And the next thought I had was, "I will arise and go unto my Father,
   and I will confess my sin, hoping that He will have mercy upon me." Is
   there one here that wants to be reconciled to God? Soul, your only hope
   of ever being reconciled to Him is on the Cross--it is through
   Jesus--and only through Jesus, that you can have even half a hope that
   is worth having of ever being the friend of God. Oh, look there! Go to
   His bleeding wounds to get life and you will then begin to get to God!

   But it was later when that hope grew into possession and into faith--it
   was then that we came to God by Christ. Many of you remember when you
   not only had a hope of being pardoned, but knew you were! Perhaps you
   remember the very day when all the load of your sin was rolled off your
   shoulders and you felt light as air, though, before, your heart had
   been heavy as lead. You remember that time. Did you not, at that
   moment, look at God and bless Him with all your heart? Did you not feel
   you loved Him because He blotted out your sin? Did you not feel that
   day that you could talk to Him, that you could praise Him, that you
   could magnify Him, that you could live for Him and die for Him? I know
   I did! I knew I had come to God because in Christ I had the full
   assurance that my transgressions were forgiven me! The life that gives
   the assurance of pardon is the life which is the way by which we come
   to God. Since then, Beloved--since we have come to God through complete
   pardon, we have often come to Him in prayer. But I will ask you, Did
   you ever get to the Father in prayer except through the Son? Have you
   ever tried to pray and forgotten Christ? If you have, it has been a
   dead failure!

   Remember the Primitive Methodist Prayer Meeting, where the brother got
   hampered in prayer and could not go on? Somebody in the meeting cried
   out, "Plead the blood, Brother! Plead the blood!" Yes, and then the man
   began to pray again! You have always found it so, I know--that you
   could not pray till you got to pleading the blood. I have many a time
   been with God in prayer, asking for a great blessing--and I have felt
   that I had not got it till I could come to such a text as this, "Do it,
   for You have promised it. Do it, for You will glorify Your Son--do it
   for His sake, He deserves it! You have promised that He shall have the
   full reward for His soul's travail--do it for His sake."

   Then I have felt I have got it, for I had got the Father because I had
   pleaded the Son. The Son's life within my soul had helped me to plead
   His precious merit and the life that showed itself in the breath of
   prayer enabled me to get to God the Father. You must have felt this,
   Believers--you must have felt this, I know. It is just the same when
   coming to God in praise. It is easy enough to sing a Psalm, pleasant
   enough to get a hymn and hum it over to yourself, alone, but for real
   worship of God and thorough devout praise of Him, you will never do it
   unless you have been, first, to the foot of the

   Cross! There is no music that is sweet to God unless Christ tunes the
   harp. If there is no blood on the harp, there will be no music such as
   God can accept. When the Lord touches the tongue, then it praises Him
   aright--but only if He touches it with a drop of Jesus' blood--nothing
   else! "Oh, let the redeemed of the Lord say so," says the
   Psalmist--"let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He has redeemed
   out of the hands of the enemy"--as if He felt that nobody could praise
   God so well as those that had tasted of the redemption that was by
   Christ Jesus. The way for every chorister to come unto God with a
   sincere thank offering in to come via Crucis--by the way of the Cross!
   Only in that way can He be accepted with His thank offering.

   But, Beloved, I trust we know what it is to come to God as a matter of
   lifelong experience. It ought not to be by fits and starts that we come
   to the Father, but, like Enoch, we are to walk with God! It should be
   habitual with us, to commune with the Most High. But, mark you, it can
   never be so unless it is habitual with us to rest upon the finished
   work of Christ. Lose your sense of acceptance in the Beloved and you
   will lose communion with God! Get away from the foot of the Cross and
   you have got away from the foot of that ladder, the top of which
   reaches to Heaven. There is no other ladder but Christ, Himself, in His
   Atonement. Get away from that and you have taken away the bridge by
   which you can get to God at all! Fellowship with God must come through
   faith in Christ! The meeting place under the Law is the meeting place
   under the Gospel.

   Now, under the Law, the only meeting place was the Mercy Seat, the
   propitiatory that covered the Law, that golden slab covered the Law on
   stone. There God met with His people. And Jesus Christ covers God's Law
   completely! Our sins are not seen--His righteousness, His
   propitiation--that is seen and God will meet us there! But He will meet
   us nowhere else! We can only come, then, to communion with the Father
   by reckoning and resting upon the mediatorial work of the Son. And
   assuredly, at the last, we shall want to come to the Father through
   Christ when the veil that now separates us from the invisible world
   shall begin to be torn in two. We shall long to be in the many mansions
   and to hear our Father's welcome, but we shall have to die with Jesus'
   name upon our lips in order to get there! We shall have to rise,
   too--our spirit will have to mount with Jesus! He must give it the wing
   and when our body rises, it must be in the image of Jesus and in the
   life of Jesus, otherwise we cannot come to the Father for the Glory
   entrance or the Grace entrance.

   It is because Christ is the life that we are able to come. We have no
   way, whatever, and no possibility of ever discovering a way by which,
   in our life, we can have fellowship with God--the God of our
   salvation--except by receiving life through Jesus Christ! Oh, men and
   women, I trust you desire to be at one with your Maker! I trust you
   wish to be friends with Him who can crush you as a moth between His
   fingers! I hope there is a desire within your soul to have Him for a
   Friend whom nothing can endure to have for an enemy! If, then, you will
   come to God, there is the gate--that gate with the mark, with the blood
   mark--you must go through there--through the wounds of Jesus!

   You get to God's heart only in that way. He has shut every other gate
   of mercy, if there ever were another open, and this one stands open as
   the only one--but it is open night and day! You must come to God the
   Father through Jesus Christ the Son, who suffered, died, rose again and
   sits at the right hand of His Father forever.

   Now we shall close our discourse by the third point, but very briefly.
   The last sentence of the text takes a sort of sweep--a broad sweep. It
   does not state that Christ is the way because He is the truth, or
   because He is the life, only, but it says without exception, "No man
   comes unto the Father but by Me," by which I understand, first, that--

   III. CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED by which we can come
   to the Father. The priest tells me that I must get to the Father only
   through him. He is a liar and there is no other answer necessary but
   that! We need not enter into such a question to debate with him. I
   would as soon believe a cow, if it could speak and tell me that I was
   to come to God by it, as believe that I was to come to God through a
   sinner like myself! No, God does not come to me in that shape--He has
   better ways and modes. "There is one God," says the Scripture, "and one
   Mediator between God and man, the Man, Christ Jesus." In that way we
   believe, but in the way of priestcraft we do not believe and may God
   save us from it!

   This is the only one, the absolutely solitary way to God, for God never
   appointed another--that is to say, He has never appointed a way through
   ceremonies, nor a way through frames of feeling, nor a way through good
   works. What is the picture of the way to Heaven by good works, Why, it
   is Mount Sinai all on a blaze, like Etna smoking and heaving like a
   great volcano! And where are the people that want to get to Heaven by
   good works? There they are, down in the valley! There is a great ring
   set round the mountain. Why don't they come up? In the first place,
   they do not want to come

   up, for the mountain is altogether on a smoke! Even Moses said, "I do
   exceedingly fear and quake." In the next place, they cannot come up,
   for there are boundaries set about the mountain--"and if so much as a
   beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with
   a dart." You cannot get nearer to God than that on the footing of
   works, for Mount Sinai is the symbol of works! Look to the flames that
   Moses saw, and shrink, and tremble, and despair! You cannot get to God
   that way!

   Calvary is the mountain! Why do you leap high hills? This is the hill
   that God has chosen--the Calvary of the Cross--the Golgotha of the
   tremendous Sacrifice! There you can get to God--He has appointed that
   to be the place where you shall meet with Him. Oh, do not try to find
   another way! Be not so arrogant as to say, "This is my way," but take
   God's way and come humbly, now, to Jesus Crucified, and you shall meet
   with God and find mercy and pardon tonight! It is the only appointed
   way.

   Next, it is the only actual way. You never did meet the man that got to
   God except through Jesus Christ. I have known men who talked about
   worshipping the pure god of Nature. I knew one who never went to a
   place of worship and when I spoke to him, he said, "I worship God in my
   own garden." I said, "Yes, I suppose that is a god made of wood. I
   think I heard you knocking him down the other morning." And I believe
   that is the true worship of Nature. It does not go much beyond that
   sort of thing and, if you find out those who profess to find God
   without coming to Jesus Christ, you will find their god is their belly
   and that they worship pleasure--and they lie in their throat when they
   talk about coming to God apart from Jesus Christ! They do not come! No
   one ever did come and no one ever shall come--the majority of them do
   not want to come. He that casts off Christ casts off God with Him, or
   he that says, "I would come to God, but will not come to Christ,"
   contradicts himself.

   There is, deep down in his very soul, a hatred of God, the very true
   God, or else there would be no hatred to the Christ of God. But Jesus
   Christ is the way, the only way and, blessed be God's name, He is an
   open way! Whoever desires to come to God the Father, tonight, may come
   through Jesus Christ! The way to God is open. There are no bolts nor
   bars, no bogs across the road to keep a sinner out. God's mercy is as
   free as the air we breathe to every soul that will take Christ and rest
   in Jesus Christ. This is the one condition--come to God by Christ--and
   you may come. Come now! Come with all your sins about you! Come in all
   your filth, and rags, and leprosy. Come, though the sentence of wrath
   hovers over you and the black clouds of justice threaten to smite you
   with the lightning of eternal wrath! You may come now and as you are,
   tonight, if you will but come through Christ.

   We need a Mediator between our souls and God, but we do not need any
   mediator between our souls and Christ. We need to get ready to come to
   God, but we need not get ready to come to Christ! You cannot come to
   God unless you are washed in the blood of Christ and clothed in the
   righteousness of Christ! But you may come to Christ just as you are--no
   need to rid yourselves of one foul blot. Come just as you are, without
   any good thing, whatever, without even enough goodness in you to be
   seen with a microscope! Come just as you are, even if you have so much
   sin that eternity could scarcely hold it! You may come to Christ though
   you are almost as bad as a devil. Though, in some respects, you are a
   very devil, yet you may come to God in Christ, but not to God out of
   Christ! You must come to Christ, first, and, at the foot of the Cross,
   look up to the atoning Sacrifice. There is a way to God's heart for
   you, even you!

   And this way is a most suitable one for all here present. You know if
   there is a ladder, it is no use to anybody if it does not go to the
   top. If I want to go up to the top of a house--and a ladder goes only
   half-way--it is of no use to me. If I want to go to God, I need a way
   that reaches up to God. Now Christ is, Himself, God. He will lead us
   right up to God through Himself if we get to Him.

   Now, a ladder that went to the top would be no good for me if it did
   not go down to the bottom! Though it reached to the top of the house,
   yet if it only went half-way down, I could not get there. Christ is a
   Man just like myself. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was born of a
   virgin and was a sufferer of human infirmities, even as you are--and
   died as you will. He lived in suffering, as you may. Oh, then,
   look--the Ladder has its foot in His Humanity and, again, has its top
   in His Deity! Climb it! He is a suitable Savior for you!

   What kind of Man was Jesus Christ when He was here on earth? He was
   very holy, but was He very reserved? Was He distant? Did He turn His
   back when He saw a sinner? Did He get to the other side of the street
   lest He should touch him and so be defiled with the presence of a
   publican or a harlot? The Pharisees did that, but not the Master, for
   this Man received sinners and ate with them! He sat at the same table
   with them and He was called the friend of publicans and sin-

   ners. Oh, Sinner, what a Christ, Christ is! What a suitable Savior for
   you! Do not think, today, that He is the judge of sinners! Today He is
   the friend of sinners! Do not look at Him, today, as though He were the
   censurer of sinners, the critic and the cynic against sinners. No, but
   the lover of sinners' souls! Oh Sinner, may His Spirit draw you to come
   to Him, tonight, in these pews!

   Let this silent cry go up, "Jesus, Son of Man and Son of God, bring me
   to Your Father! Teach me Your Father by teaching me Yourself! Give me
   life before God by giving me life in You. You are the way--Yourself, in
   Your own Person. I trust You--be the way for me, for me, for me,
   unworthy though I am! Dear, dear Savior, glorify Your mercy by
   forgiving my sin, my great sin, and accept my unworthy person through
   Your infinite compassion, and reconcile me unto God."

   Oh, such a prayer as that will be heard! Have you prayed it? It is
   heard! If you do not feel it is heard, pray it again! Keep on praying
   it but, above all, look to Christ upon the Cross! Count the purple
   drops as they distil from His dear wounds! Remember that He was God
   that died upon that Cross. Sit and look, and look, and look, and look
   again! Look, I say, and look again--and if peace does not come with
   looking, keep on looking and you will get peace there--and faith there,
   and life there! You will not take faith to Christ--you will get faith
   from Christ! Keep on looking! Keep on looking!

   I heard a Brother say the other day that what he saw, he always looked
   at. And that is a sensible thing to do with a great many things, but,
   above all, with Christ. If you see Him, keep on looking at Him! It does
   not merely say, "See Christ," but, "Look unto Him, look unto Him, and
   be you saved, all you ends of the earth." God grant you that gracious
   life--look, for Jesus Christ's sake. Amen.

   The Sum and Substance of All Theology

   Unpublished Notes of a Sermon

   Intended for Reading on Lord's-Day, April 17th, 1892,

   Delivered by

   C. H. SPURGEON,

   Delivered at Bethesda Chapel, Swansea

   On June 25th, 1861.

   From Sword and Trowel

   Note: On Tuesday, June 25th, 1861, the beloved C. H. Spurgeon visited
   Swansea. The day was wet, so the services could not be held in the
   open-air; and, as no building in the town was large enough to hold the
   vast concourses of people who had come from all parts to hear the
   renowned preacher, he consented to deliver two discourses in the
   morning; first at Bethesda, and then at Trinity Chapel. At each place
   he preached for an hour and a quarter. The weather cleared up during
   the day; so, in the evening, Mr. Spurgeon addressed an immense
   gathering of people in the open-air.--T.W.M.

   FORWARDED BY PASTOR T. W. MEDHURST, CARDIFF.

   "All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me; and him that cometh to
   Me I will in no wise cast out."--John 6:37.

   What a difference there is between the words of Christ, and those of
   all mere men! Most men speak many words, yet say but little; Christ
   speaks few words, yet says very much. In modern books, you may read
   scores of pages, and scarcely come across a new thought; but when
   Christ speaks, every syllable seems to tell. He hits the nail on the
   head each time He lifts the hammer of His Word. The Words of Christ are
   like ingots of solid gold; we preachers too often beat out the gold so
   thin, that whole acres of it would scarcely be worth a farthing. The
   Words of Christ are always to be distinguished from those of His
   creatures, not only for their absolute truthfulness, but also for their
   profound fulness of matter. In all His language He is "full of grace
   and truth." Look at the text before us. Here we have, in two small
   sentences, the sum and substance of all theology. The great questions
   which have divided the Church in all ages, the apparently contradictory
   doctrines which have set one minister of Christ against his fellow, are
   here revealed so simply and plainly, "that he may run that readeth"
   (Habakkuk ii.2). Even a child may understand the Words of Christ,
   though perhaps the loftiest human intellect cannot fathom the mystery
   hidden therein.

   Take the first sentence of my text: "All that the Father giveth Me
   shall come to Me." What a weighty sentence! Here we have taught us what
   is called, in the present day, "High Calvinistic doctrine"--the purpose
   of God; the certainty that God's purpose will stand; the invincibility
   of God's will; and the absolute assurance that Christ "shall see of the
   travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied."

   Look at the second sentence of my text: "And him that cometh to me I
   will in no wise cast out." Here we have the richness, the fulness, the
   unlimited extent of the power of Christ to save those who put their
   trust in Him. Here is a text upon which one might preach a thousand
   sermons. We might take these two sentences as a life-long text, and
   never exhaust the theme.

   Mark, too, how our Lord Jesus Christ gives us the whole truth. We have
   many ministers who can preach well upon the first sentence: "All that
   the Father giveth Me shall come to Me." Just set them going upon
   Election, or everlasting covenant engagements, and they will be earnest
   and eloquent, for they are fond of dwelling upon these points, and a
   well-instructed child of God can hear them with delight and profit.
   Such preachers are often the fathers of the Church, and the very
   pillars thereof; but, unfortunately, many of these excellent brethren
   cannot preach so well upon the second sentence of my text: "And him
   that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out." When they get to that
   truth, they are half afraid of it; they hesitate to preach what they
   consider to be a too open salvation. They cannot give the gospel
   invitation as freely as they find it in the Word of God. They do not
   deny it, yet they stutter and stammer sadly, when they get upon this
   theme.

   Then, on the other hand, we have a large number of good ministers who
   can preach on this second clause of the text, but they cannot preach on
   the first clause. How fluent is their language as they tell out the
   freeness of salvation! Here they are much at home in their preaching;
   but, we are sorry to be compelled to say that, very often, they are not
   much at home when they come to doctrinal matters, and they would find
   it rather a difficult matter to preach fluently on the first sentence
   of my text. They would, if they attempted to preach from it, endeavour
   to cut out of it all that savours of Divine Sovereignty. They do not
   preach the whole "truth" which "is in Jesus."

   Why is it that some of us do not see both sides of God's revealed
   truth? We persist in closing one eye; we will not see all that may be
   seen if we open both our eyes; and, sometimes, we get angry with a
   brother because he can see a little more than we do. I think our text
   is very much like a stereoscopic picture, for it presents two views of
   the truth. Both views are correct, for they are both photographed by
   the same light. How can we bring these two truths together? We get the
   stereoscope of the scripture, and looking with both eyes, the two
   pictures melt into one. God has given us, in His Word, the two pictures
   of divine truth; but we have not all got the stereoscope properly
   adjusted to make them melt into one. When we get to heaven, we shall
   see how all God's truth harmonizes. If we cannot make these two parts
   of truth harmonize now, at any rate we must not dare to blot out one of
   them, for God has given them both.

   Now, as God shall help me this morning, I want to expand both sentences
   of my text with equal fidelity and plainness. I shall not expect to
   please some of you while speaking on the first sentence, and I shall
   not be surprised if I fail to please others of you when I come to the
   second sentence; but, in ether case, it will be a small matter to me if
   I have an easy conscience because I have proclaimed what I believe to
   be the whole truth of God. I am sure you will be willing to give a
   patient hearing to that which you may not fully receive, if you believe
   it to be declared in all honesty. Reject what I say, if it be not true,
   but if it be the Word of God, receive it; and, be it known unto you
   that it is at your peril if you dare to reject the truthful Word of the
   glad tidings of God.

   I. I will begin with the first sentence of the text: "All that the
   Father giveth Me shall come to Me." We have here, first, THE FIRM
   FOUNDATION UPON WHICH OUR SALVATION RESTS.

   It rests, you perceive, not on something which man does, but on
   something which God the Father does. The Father gives certain persons
   to His Son, and the Son says, "All that the Father giveth Me Shall come
   to Me." I take it that the meaning of the text is this,--that, if any
   do come to Jesus Christ, it is those whom the Father gave to Christ.
   And the reason why they come,--if we search to the very bottom of
   things,--is, that the Father puts it into their hearts to come. The
   reason why one man is saved, and another man is lost, is to be found in
   God; not in anything which the saved man did, or did not do; not in
   anything which he felt, or did not feel; but in something altogether
   irrespective of himself, even in the sovereign grace of God. In the day
   of God's power, the saved are made willing to give their souls to
   Jesus. The language of Scripture must explain this point. "As many as
   received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to
   them that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor of
   the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God" (John i. 12,
   13). "So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
   but of God that sheweth mercy" (Romans ix. 16). If you want to see the
   fount of grace, you must go to the everlasting God; even as, if you
   want to know why that river runs in this direction, and not in that,
   you must trace it up to its source. In the case of every soul that is
   now in heaven, it was the will of God that drew it thither. In the case
   of every spirit that is on its way to glory now, unto God and unto Him
   alone must be the honour of its salvation; for He it is who makes one
   "differ from another" (1 Cor. iv. 7).

   I do not care to argue upon this point, except I put it thus: If any
   say, "It is man himself who makes the difference," I reply, "You are
   involving yourself in a great dilemma; if man himself makes the
   difference, then mark--man himself must have the glory." Now, I am
   certain you do not mean to give man the glory of his own salvation; you
   would not have men throw up their caps in heaven, and shout, "Unto
   ourselves be the glory, for we, ourselves, were the hinge and turning
   point of our own salvation." No, you would have all the saved cast
   their crowns at the feet of Jesus, and give to Him alone all the honour
   and all the glory. This, however, cannot be, unless, in that critical
   point, that diamond hinge upon which man's salvation shall turn, God
   shall have the control, and not the will of man. You know that those
   who do not believe this truth as a matter of doctrine, do believe it in
   their hearts as a matter of experience.

   I was preaching, not very long ago, at a place in Derbyshire, to a
   congregation, nearly all of whom were Methodists, and as I preached,
   they were crying out, "Hallelujah! Glory! Bless the Lord!." They were
   full of excitement, until I went on to say in my sermon, "This brings
   me to the doctrine of Election." There was no crying out of "Glory!"
   and "Hallelujah!" then. Instead, there was a great deal of shaking of
   the head, and a sort of telegraphing round the place, as though
   something dreadful was coming. Now, I thought, I must have their
   attention again, so I said, "You all believe in the doctrine of
   Election?" "No, we don't, lad," said one. "Yes, you do, and I am going
   to preach it to you, and make you cry 'Hallelujah!' over it." I am
   certain they mistrusted my power to do that; so, turning a moment from
   the subject, I said, "Is there any difference between you and the
   ungodly world?" "Ay! Ay! Ay!" "Is there any difference between you and
   the drunkard, the harlot, the blasphemer?" "Ay! Ay! Ay!" Ay! there was
   a difference indeed. "Well, now," I said, "there is a great difference;
   who made it, then?" for, whoever made the difference, should have the
   glory of it. "Did you make the difference?" "No, lad," said one; and
   the rest all seemed to join in the chorus. "Who made the difference,
   then? Why, the Lord did it; and did you think it wrong for Him to make
   a difference between you and other men?" "No, no," they quickly said.
   "Very well, then; if it was not wrong for God to make the difference,
   it was not wrong for Him to purpose to make it, and that is the
   doctrine of Election." Then they cried, "Hallelujah!" as I said they
   would.

   The doctrine of Election is God's purposing in His heart that He would
   make some men better than other men; that He would give to some men
   more grace than to other men; that some should come out and receive the
   mercy; that others, left to their own free will, should reject it; that
   some should gladly accept the invitations of mercy, while others, of
   their own accord, stubbornly refuse the mercy to which the whole world
   of mankind is invited. All men, by nature, refuse the invitations of
   the gospel. God, in the sovereignty of His grace, makes a difference by
   secretly inclining the hearts of some men, by the power of His Holy
   Spirit, to partake of His everlasting mercy in Christ Jesus. I am
   certain that, whether we are Calvinists or Arminians, if our hearts are
   right with God, we shall all adoringly testify: "We love Him, because
   He first loved us." If that be not Election, I know not what it is.

   II. Now, in the second place, note THE CERTAINTY OF THE ETERNAL
   SALVATION OF ALL WHO WERE GIVEN TO JESUS; "All that the Father giveth
   Me shall come to Me."

   This is eternally settled, and so settled that it cannot be altered by
   either man or devil. All whose names are written in the Book of Life of
   the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, all whom God the
   Father designed to save when He gave up His well-beloved Son to die
   upon the cross of Calvary, shall in time be drawn by the Holy Spirit,
   and shall surely come to Christ, and be kept by the Spirit, through the
   precious blood of Christ, and be folded for ever with His sheep, on the
   hill-tops of glory.

   Mark! "All that the Father giveth Me shall come to Me." Not one of
   those whom the Father hath given to Jesus shall perish. If any were
   lost, the text would have to read: "Almost all," or, "All but one;" but
   it positively says "All," without any exception; even though one may
   have been, in his unregenerate state, the very chief of sinners. Yet
   even that chosen one, that given one, shall come to Jesus; and when he
   has come, he shall be held by that strong love that at first chose him,
   and he shall never be let go, but shall be held fast, even unto the
   end. Miss Much-afraid, and Mrs. Despondency, and Mr. Feeble-mind, shall
   as certainly come to the arms of Christ, as Mr. Great-heart, and Mr.
   Faithful, and Mr. Valiant-for-Truth. If one jewel were lost from
   Christ's crown, then Christ's crown would not be all-glorious. If one
   member of the body of Christ were to perish, Christ's body would not be
   complete. If one of those who are one with Christ should miss his way
   to eternal life, Christ would not be a perfect Christ.

   "All that the Father giveth Me Shall come to Me." "But suppose they
   will not come?" I cannot suppose any such thing, for He says they
   "shall come." They shall be made willing in the day of God's power. God
   knows how to make a passage through the heart of man; and though man is
   a free agent, yet God can incline him, willingly, to come to Jesus.
   There are many sentences even in Wesley's hymn-book which contain this
   truth. If God took away freedom from man, and then saved him, it would
   be but a small miracle. For God to leave man free to come to Jesus, and
   yet to so move him as to make him come, is a divinely-wrought miracle
   indeed. If we were for a moment to admit that man's will could be more
   than a match for God's will, do you not see where we should be landed?
   Who made man? God! Who made God? Shall we lift up man to the sovereign
   throne of Deity? Who shall be master, and have his way, God or man? The
   will of God, that says they "shall come", knows how to make them come.

   "But suppose it should be one of those who are living in the interior
   of Africa, and he does not hear the gospel; what then?" He shall hear
   the gospel; either he shall come to the gospel, or the gospel shall go
   to him. Even if no minister should go to such a chosen one, he would
   have the gospel specially revealed to him rather than that the promise
   of the Almighty God should be broken.

   "But suppose there should be one of God's chosen who has become so bad
   that there is no hope for him? He never attends a place of worship;
   never listens to the gospel; the voice of the preacher never reaches
   him; he has grown hardened in his sin, like steel that has been seven
   times annealed in the fire; what then?" That man shall be arrested by
   God's grace, and that obdurate, hard-hearted one shall be made to see
   the mercy of God; the tears shall stream down his cheeks, and he shall
   be made willing to receive Jesus as Saviour. I think that, as God could
   bend my will, and bring me to Christ, He can bring anybody.

   "Why was I made to hear His voice,

   And enter while there's room;

   When thousands make a wretched choice,

   And rather starve than come?

   "'Twas the same love the spread the feast,

   That sweetly forced me in;

   Else I had still refused to taste,

   And perish'd in my sin."

   Yes, "sweetly forced me in;"--there is no other word that can so
   accurately describe my case. Oh, how long Jesus Christ stood at the
   door of my heart, and knocked, and knocked, and knocked in vain! I
   asked: "Why should I leave the pleasures of this world?" Yet still He
   knocked, and there was music in every sound of His pleading voice; but
   I said, "Nay, let Him go elsewhere." And though, through the window, I
   could see His thorn-crowned head, and the tears standing in His eyes,
   and the prints of the nails in His hands, as He stood and knocked, and
   said, "Open to Me," yet I heeded Him not. Then He sent my mother to me,
   and she pleaded, "let the Saviour in, Charlie;" and I replied, in
   action, though not in words, "Nay, I love thee, my mother; but I do not
   love Christ, thy Saviour." Then came the black hours of sickness; but
   in effect I said, "Nay, I fear not sickness, nor death itself; I will
   still defy my Maker." But it happened, one day, that He graciously put
   in His hand by the hole of the door, and I moved toward Him, and then I
   opened the door, and cried, "Come in! Come in!" Alas! alas! He was
   gone; and for five long years I stood, with tears in mine eyes, and I
   sought Him weeping, but I found Him not. I cried after Him, but He
   answered me not. I said, "Whither is He gone? Oh, that I had never
   rejected Him? Oh, that He would but come again!" Surely the angels must
   then have said, "A great change has come over that youth; he would not
   let Christ in when He knocked, but now he wants Christ to come." And
   when He did come, do you think my soul rejected Him? Nay, nay; but I
   fell down at His feet, crying, "Come in! Come in! thou Blessed Saviour.
   I have waited for Thy salvation, O my God!"

   There is no living soul beyond the reach of hope, no chosen one whom
   Christ cannot bring up even from the very gates of hell. He can bare
   His arm, put out His hand, and pluck the brand "out of the fire"
   (Zechariah iii.2). In a horrible pit, in the miry clay, His jewels have
   been hidden; but down from the throne of light He can come, and
   thrusting in His arm of mercy, He can pull them out, and cause them to
   glitter in His crown for ever. Let it be settled in our hearts, as a
   matter of fact, that what God has purposed to do, He will surely
   accomplish.

   I need not dwell longer upon this point, because I think I have really
   brought out the essence of this first sentence of my text: "All that
   the Father giveth Me shall come to Me." Permit me just to remark,
   before I pass on, that I am sometimes sad on account of the alarm that
   some Christians seem to have concerning this precious and glorious
   doctrine. We have, in the Baptist denomination,--I am sorry to have to
   say it,--many ministers, excellent brethren, who, while they believe
   this doctrine, yet never preach it. On the other hand, we have some
   ministers, excellent brethren, who never preach anything else. They
   have a kind of barrel-organ that only plays five tunes, and they are
   always repeating them. It is either Election, Predestination,
   Particular Redemption, Effectual Calling, Final Perseverance, or
   something of that kind; it is always the same note. But we have also a
   great many others who never preach concerning these doctrines, though
   they admit they are doctrines taught in Sacred Scripture. The reason
   for their silence is, because they say these truths are not suitable to
   be preached from the pulpit. I hold such an utterance as that to be
   very wicked. Is the doctrine here--in this Bible? If it is, as God hath
   taught it, so are we to teach it. "But," they say, "not in a mixed
   assembly." Where can you find an unmixed assembly? God has sent the
   Bible into a mixed world, and the gospel is to be preached in " all the
   world", and "to every creature." "Yes," they say, "preach the gospel,
   but not these special truths of the gospel; because, if you preach
   these doctrines, the people will become Antinomians and
   Hyper-Calvinists." Not so; the reason why people become
   Hyper-Calvinists and Antinomians, is because some, who profess to be
   Calvinists, often keep back part of the truth, and do not, as Paul did,
   "declare all the counsel of God"; they select certain parts of
   Scripture, where their own particular views are taught, and pass by
   other aspects of God's truth. Such preachers as John Newton, and in
   later times, your own Christmas Evans, were men who preached the whole
   truth of God; they kept back nothing that God has revealed; and, as the
   result of their preaching, Antinomianism could not find a foot-hold
   anywhere. We should have each doctrine of Scripture in its proper
   place, and preach it fully; and if we want to have a genuine revival of
   religion, we must preach these doctrines of Jehovah's sovereign grace
   again and again. Do not tell me they will not bring revivals. There was
   but one revival that I have ever heard of, apart from Calvinistic
   doctrine, and that was the one in which Wesley took so great a part;
   but then George Whitefield was there also to preach the whole Word of
   God. When people are getting sleepy, if you want to arouse and wake
   them up thoroughly, preach the doctrine of Divine Sovereignty to them;
   for that will do it right speedily.

   III. I shall now turn very briefly to the second sentence of my text:
   "And him that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out."

   "Now," says somebody, "he is going to knock down all that he has been
   building up." Well, I would rather be inconsistent with myself than
   with my Master; but I dare not alter this second sentence, and I have
   no desire to alter it. Let it stand as it is, all its glorious
   simplicity:--

   "HIM THAT COMETH TO ME I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT."

   Let the whole world come, still this promise is big enough to embrace
   them all in its arms. There is no mistake here, the wrong man cannot
   come. If any sinner come to Christ, he is sure to be the right one.
   Mark, too, as there is no limitation in the person coming, so there is
   no limitation in the manner of the coming. Says one, "Suppose I come
   the wrong way?" You cannot come the wrong way; it is written, "No man
   can come to Me, except the Father which hath sent Me draw him." "No man
   can come unto Me, except it were given unto him of My Father" (John
   vi.44,65). If, then, you come to Christ in any way, you are drawn of
   the Father, and He cannot draw the wrong way. If you come to Christ at
   all, the power and will to come have been given you of the Father. If
   you come to Christ, He will in no wise cast you out; for no possible or
   conceivable reason will Jesus ever cast out any sinner who comes to
   Him. There is no reason in hell, or on earth, or in heaven, why Jesus
   should cast out the soul that comes to Him. If Satan, the foul accuser
   of the brethren, brings reasons why the coming sinner should not be
   received, Jesus will "cast down" the accuser, but He will not "cast
   out" the sinner. "Come unto Me, all ye that labour, and are heavy
   laden, and I will give your rest," is still His invitation and His
   promise, too.

   Let us suppose a case by the way of illustration. Here is a man in
   Swansea,--ragged, dirty, coal-begrimed,--who has received a message
   from Her Most Gracious Majesty, Queen Victoria. It reads in this wise:
   "You are hereby commanded to come, just as you are, to our palace at
   Windsor, to receive great and special favours at our hand. You will
   stay away at your peril." The man reads the message, and at first
   scarcely understands it; so he thinks, "I must wash and prepare
   myself." Then, he re-reads the royal summons, and the words arrest him:
   "Come just as your are." So he starts, and tells the people in the
   train where he is going, and they laugh at him. At length he arrives at
   Windsor Castle; there he is stopped by the guard, and questioned. He
   explains why he has come, and shows the Queen's message; and he is
   allowed to pass. He next meets with a gentlemen in waiting, who, after
   some explanations and expressions of astonishment, allows him to enter
   the ante-room. When there, our friend becomes frightened on account of
   his begrimed and ragged appearance; he is half inclined to rush from
   the place with fear, when he remembers the works of the royal command:
   "Stay away at your peril." Presently, the Queen herself appears, and
   tells him how glad she is that he has come just as he was. She says she
   purposes that he shall be suitably clothed, and be made one of the
   princes of her court. She adds, "I told you to come as you were. It
   seemed to be a strange command to you, but I am glad you have obeyed,
   and so come."

   I do think this is what Jesus Christ says to every creature under
   heaven. The gospel invitation runs thus: "Come, come, come to Christ,
   just as you are." "But, let me feel more." No, come just as you are.
   "But let me get home to my own room, and let me pray." No, no, come to
   Christ just as you are. As you are, trust in Jesus, and He will save
   you. Oh, do dare to trust Him! If anybody shall ask, "Who are you?"
   answer, "I am nobody." If anyone objects, "You are such a filthy
   sinner," reply, "Yes,'tis true, so I am; but He Himself told me to
   come." If anyone shall say, "You are not fit to come," say, "I know I
   am not fit; but He told me to come." Therefore,--

   "Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched,

   Weak and wounded, sick and sore;

   Jesus ready stands to save you,

   Full of pity join'd with power;

   He is able,

   He is willing; doubt no more.

   "Let not conscience make you linger,

   Nor of fitness fondly dream;

   All the fitness He requireth,

   Is to feel you need of Him:

   This He gives you;

   'Tis the Spirit's rising beam."

   Sinner, trust in Jesus: and if thou dost perish trusting in Jesus, I
   will perish with thee. I will make my bed in hell, side by side with
   thee, sinner, if thou canst perish trusting in Christ, and thou shalt
   lie there, and taunt me to all eternity for having taught thee falsely,
   if we perish. But that can never be; those who trust in Jesus shall
   never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of His hand. Come to
   Jesus, and He will in no wise cast thee out.

   May the Lord bless the words I have spoken! Though hastily suggested to
   my mind, and feebly delivered to you, the Lord bless them, for Christ's
   sake! Amen.
