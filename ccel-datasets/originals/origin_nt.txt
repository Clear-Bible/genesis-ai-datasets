PREFACE

   The purpose of the following pages will be fulfilled if they serve to
   forward and complete the work accomplished by the histories of the
   Canon of the New Testament that already exist. The history of the New
   Testament is here only given up to the beginning of the third century;
   for at that time the New Canon was firmly established both in idea and
   form, and it acquired all the consequences of an unalterable entity.
   The changes which it still under-went, however important they were from
   the point of view of the extent and unification of the Canon, have had
   no consequences worth mentioning in connection with the history of the
   Church and of dogma. It is therefore appropriate, in the interests of
   clear thought, to treat the history of the Canon of the New Testament
   in two divisions; in the first division to describe the Origin of the
   New Testament, in the second its enlargement. Moreover, it is
   necessary--though this is a point that hitherto has been seldom taken
   into account--that the consequences that at once resulted from the new
   creation should receive due consideration as well as its causes and
   motives. For the origin of the New Testament is not a problem in the
   history of literature like the origin of the separate books of the
   Canon, but a problem of the history of cultus and dogma in the Church.

Introduction                                                                 xv

I. The Needs and Motive Forces that led to the Creation of the New
Testament
                                                                             1
     The five chief problems--


     § 1. How did the Church arrive at a second authoritative Canon in
     addition to the Old Testament?
                                                                             4


     A. What motives led to the creation of the New Testament?
                                                                             6


     (1) Supreme reverence for the words and teaching of Christ ("The Holy
     Scriptures and the Lord"), p. 7. (2) Supreme reverence for the history
     of Christ ("The Holy Scriptures and the Gospel")--the synthesis of
     prophecy and fulfilment, p. 9. (3) The new Covenant and the desire for
     a fundamental document, p. 12. (4) Supreme reverence for what was
     orthodox and ancient (the motive of Catholic and Apostolic), p. 16.



     B. Whence came the authority necessary for such a creation?
                                                                             20


     (1) Teachers from the beginning that were authoritative and inspired by
     the Spirit ("Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers"), p. 20. (2) The right
     of the assembled community to accept or reject books, P. 21. (3) The
     inward authority of Apostolic-Catholic writings that asserted itself
     automatically, p. 23.



     C. How did the New Testament, assumed to be necessary in idea, come
     into actual existence?
                                                                             25


     (1) The existence of appropriate works, p. 26. (2) Public lection (also
     private), p. 26. (3) The importance of the example of Marcion and the
     Gnostics (the element of compulsion in the creation of the New
     Testament), p. 29. (4) The importance of the Montanist controversy,
     especially for the idea of the closing of the new Canon, p. 34. The
     result; relation to the Old Testament; the "ecclesiastical scriptures,"
     p. 40.



     § 2. Why is it that the New Testament also contains other books beside
     the Gospels, and appears as a compilation with two divisions
     ("Evangelium" and "Apostolus")?
                                                                             42


     The New Testament had already taken up into itself the earliest
     tradition of the Church
                                                                             42


     A. The Apostles became, in a certain sense, equivalent to Christ.
     Estimation of St Paul; importance of the Acts of the Apostles
                                                                             44


     B. The attestation of the Revelation became as important as its
     content; even the Gospels come under the idea of the Apostolic. The new
     dominant note of the collection not "the Lord," but "the Apostles"
                                                                             53


     C. The importance of the Canon of Marcion and of the Gnostics also for
     the division into two parts, especially for the prestige of the Pauline
     Epistles; their inward and outward Catholicity
                                                                             57


     The Catholic Epistles and the Acts; the central importance of the
     latter for the structure of the New Testament; the New Testament in its
     completion a work of reflection
                                                                             63


     § 3. Why does the New Testament contain four Gospels and not only one?
                                                                             68


     The age and the significance of the canonical titles of the four
     Gospels
                                                                             68


     The time and place of the compilation (Asia Minor)
                                                                             71


     Tension between the Gospels and the compromise in the acceptance of
     four
                                                                             72


     The number four not originally intended to be final; against Jülicher
                                                                             74


     The same motive that led to the "Apostolus" prevented the unification
     of the four Gospels
                                                                             80


     § 4. Why has only one Apocalypse been able to keep its place in the New
     Testament? Why not several--or none at all?
                                                                             83


     The Muratorian Fragment as starting-point
                                                                             83


     Three Apocalypses originally in New Testament
                                                                             85


     The expulsion of Prophecy and the sovereignty of the Apostolic in the
     New Testament
                                                                             87


     How was it that the break with Prophecy was not necessarily felt as a
     breach with the past?
                                                                             90


     The expulsion of the Petrine Apocalypse and of Hermas
                                                                             91


     The dangerous situation of the Johannine Apocalypse
                                                                             92


     § 5. Was the New Testament created consciously? and how did the
     Churches arrive at one common New Testament?
                                                                             94


     The New Testament must have been founded between A.D. 160 and 180, and
     in idea finally completed between A.D. 180 and 200
                                                                             95


     Structure, choice of books, and the titles of the collection show that
     in the last resort it is a conscious creation
                                                                             96


     The immediate forerunner of the New Testament is to be sought in the
     Churches lying on the line between Western Asia Minor and Rome
                                                                             100


     The fixing of the Canon as a collection of Apostolic-Catholic works
     took place in Rome
                                                                             103


     The testimony of the Muratorian Canon to this fact
                                                                             106


     Summary of results. The witness of Clement of Alexandria to the
     immediate forerunner of the New Testament
                                                                             109


     The reception of the Now Testament, and its completion in a collection
     of twenty-seven books at Alexandria
                                                                             111


     The victory of this New Testament
                                                                             112

II. The Consequences of the Creation of the New Testament
                                                                             115


     § 1. The New Testament immediately emancipated itself from the
     conditions of its origin and claimed to be regarded simply as a gift of
     the Holy Spirit. It held an independent position side by side with the
     Rule of Faith, it at once began to influence the development of
     doctrine, and it became in principle the final court of appeal for the
     Christian life
                                                                             116


     § 2. The New Testament has added to the Revelation in History a second
     written proclamation of this Revelation, and has given it a position of
     superior authority
                                                                             121


     § 3. The New Testament definitely protected the Old Testament as a book
     of the Church, but thrust it into a subordinate position, and thus
     introduced a wholesome complication into the conception of the Canon of
     Scripture
                                                                             125


     § 4. The New Testament has preserved for us the most valuable portion
     of primitive Christian literature, yet at the same time it delivered
     the rest of the earliest works to oblivion and has limited the
     transmission of later works
                                                                             131


     § 5. Though the New Testament brought to an end the production of
     authoritative Christian writings, yet it cleared the way for
     theological and also for ordinary Christian literary activity
                                                                             138


     § 6. The New Testament obscured the true origin and the historical
     significance of the works which it contained, but on the other hand, by
     impelling men to study them, it brought into existence certain
     conditions favourable to the critical treatment and correct
     interpretation of these works
                                                                             140


     § 7. The New Testament checked the imaginative creation of events in
     the scheme of Salvation whether freely or according to existing models,
     but it called forth, or at least encouraged the intellectual creation
     of facts in the sphere of theology and of a theological mythology
                                                                             144


     § 8. The New Testament helped to demark a special period of Christian
     Revelation, and so in a certain sense to give Christians of later times
     an inferior status; yet it kept alive the ideals and claims of
     primitive Christianity
                                                                             147


     § 9. The New Testament promoted and completed the fatal identification
     of the Word of the Lord and the Teaching of the Apostles; but because
     It raised Pauline Christianity to a place of high honour, it has
     introduced into the history of the Church a ferment rich in blessing
                                                                             150


     § 10. In the New Testament the Catholic Church forged for herself a new
     weapon with which to ward off all heresy as un-Christian, but she has
     also found in it a court of control before which she has appeared ever
     increasingly in default
                                                                             154


     § 11. The New Testament has hindered the natural impulse to give to the
     content of Religion simple, clear, and logical expression, but on the
     other hand it has preserved Christian doctrine from becoming a mere
     philosophy of Religion
                                                                             158

Conclusion
                                                                             162

INTRODUCTION

   The collection of writings Apostolic and Catholic (the New Testament),
   the Apostolic Rule of Faith, the Apostolic character assigned to the
   Bishops (dependent upon succession) mark the chief results of the inner
   development of Church history during the first two centuries. This
   conclusion, as modern text-books of the history of Church and dogma
   show, is to-day almost universally accepted. And yet, with all our
   excellent treatises on the history of the origin of the New Testament,
   and in spite of the far-reaching agreement of our scholars in just this
   province of research, it is still not superfluous to show how clearly
   and comprehensively the history of the Primitive Church has manifested
   itself in the leading principle, in the creation and compilation of the
   New Testament, and how vast and decisive, and, on the other hand, how
   various and even contradictory were the consequences of its appearance.
   [1] Moreover, the question whether and to what extent the New Testament
   was consciously created has not yet been cleared up. Lastly, though it
   is firmly established that this collection of inspired writings is a
   remainder-product--for once upon a time everything that a Christian
   wrote for edification counted as inspired--yet there is still need of
   more rigorous investigation of the circumstances which necessarily led
   to restriction and choice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] In my Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte (14, S. 372-399) I have given a
   sketch of the history of the origin of the New Testament from the
   standpoint of the history of Dogma. The object of the following pages
   is to give a more comprehensive and clear-cut discussion of the chief
   points in the story of the development, and of the motive forces at
   work, in connection with the general history of the Church, and to
   state more forcibly the consequences of the creation of the New
   Testament.
     __________________________________________________________________

                        THE ORIGIN OF THE NEW TESTAMENT

I

  The Needs and Motive Forces that led to the Creation of the New Testament

   If the trained observer surveys merely the Title and the Table of
   Contents of the New Testament, whether in its present form or in the
   older and shorter form of the close of the second century, and if he
   adopts the viewpoint of the Apostolic Age, he is faced by at least five
   great historical problems.

   The Books of the New Testament
   (or the New Testament).

   The Gospel    { according to Matthew
                   according to Mark.
                   according to Luke.
                   according to John.
   The Apostolus { The Acts of the Apostles.
                   Thirteen Epistles of Paul.
                   The Epistle of Jude.
                   The lst and 2nd Epistles of John. [2]
   The Apostolus { (The 1st Epistle of Peter).
                   The Revelation of John.
                   (The Revelation of Peter).
                   (The Shephard of Hermas). [3]

   The five problems are these:--

   1. What is the reason and how did it come about that a second
   authoritative collection of books arose among Christians? Why were they
   not satisfied with the Old Testament, or with a Christian edition of
   the Old Testament, or--if they must needs have a new collection --why
   did they not reject the old? Why did they take upon themselves the
   burden and complication of two collections? Finally, when did the idea
   of a fixed second collection first appear?

   2. Why does the New Testament contain other works in addition to the
   Gospels, and thus appear as a whole with two divisions (Gospel and
   Apostle)?

   3. Why does the New Testament contain four gospels and not one only?

   4. Why could only one "Revelation" keep its place in the New Testament?
   Why not several or none at all?

   5. Was the New Testament created consciously? How did the Churches
   arrive at one common New Testament, seeing that the individual
   communities, or provincial Churches, were independent, and that the
   Church was one only in idea?

   From the standpoint of the Apostolic Epoch these five questions appear
   as just so many enormous paradoxes so long as one does not go deeply
   beneath the surface of events as they developed. I purpose to attempt a
   brief discussion of these questions; and it would be perhaps much to
   the point if future works on the history of the Canon of the New
   Testament started in the same way.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. How did the Church arrive at a second authoritative Canon in
   addition to the Old Testament?

   From the standpoint of the Apostolic Epoch it would be perfectly
   intelligible if the Church, in regard to written authorities, had
   decided to be satisfied with the possession of the Old Testament. I
   need not trouble to prove this. We should, however, have been to a
   certain extent prepared if, as time went on, the Church had added some
   other writings to this book to which it held fast. Indeed, in the first
   century, even among the Jews, the Old Testament was not yet quite
   rigidly closed, its third division was still in a somewhat fluid
   condition, and, above all, in the Dispersion, among the Greek-speaking
   Jews, side by side with the Scriptures of the Palestinian collection,
   there were in circulation numerous sacred writings in Greek of which a
   considerable number became gradually and quite naturally attached to
   the authoritative collection. It would therefore have been in no sense
   surprising, nor would it have been regarded as extraordinary, if from
   the Christian side some new edifying works had been added to this
   collection. This actually happened here and there with Apocalypses;
   indeed, attempts were even made to smuggle new chapters and verses into
   some of the ancient books of the Canon. [4] In this fashion Christians
   might have proceeded in yet bolder style, without doing anything
   unusual, and so might have been able to satisfy requirements which were
   not met, or not completely met, by the Old Testament. Lastly, judging
   from the standpoint of the Apostolic Age, we should not have been
   surprised if in the near future the Old Testament had been rejected or
   set aside by the Gentile Churches. When the word had gone forth that
   one should know nothing else than Christ Crucified and Risen, when it
   was taught that the Law was abolished and that all had become new, the
   step was very near to recognise the Gospel of Christ, and nothing else.
   "I believe nothing that I do not find in the Gospel" (Ignat., Phil.,
   8)--what object then was served by the Old Testament? That the Apostle
   who taught all this nevertheless himself accepted the Old Testament
   offered no special difficulty. Gentile Christians knew very well that
   the Apostle, who to Jews became a Jew, for his own person and out of
   regard to the Jews, had clung to many things that were not meant to be
   accepted by others or need no longer be accepted. For all these
   possibilities (the Old Testament alone; an enriched Old Testament; no
   Old Testament) we should thus have been prepared; but we should have
   been absolutely unprepared for that which actually happened--a second
   authoritative collection. How did this come about? It is true indeed
   that the fact that an Old Testament existed had the most important part
   in the suggestion and creation of a New Testament; and yet for decades
   of years the Old Testament was the greatest hindrance to such a
   creation, more especially because the Old Testament in a very complete
   and masterly way was subjected to Christian interpretation, [5] and so
   Christians already possessed in it a foundation document for that new
   thing which they had experienced. Still, far down beneath the movements
   of the time, a more sure preparation was being made for that which was
   to come, namely the New Testament, than for all the other
   possibilities. These had their strength in forces which lay on the
   surface; but under the surface a new spirit was working from the
   beginning, and was striving to come to light.

   Here three questions present themselves: (A) What motives led to the
   creation of the New Testament? (B) Whence came the authority that was
   necessary for such a creation? (C) Supposing the necessity of a New
   Testament, how did it actually come into being?

   (A) Here a series of motives increasing in importance were at work; but
   it was the last of these that demanded a new written authority side by
   side with the Old Testament (and this without abandonment of the same).

   (1) The earliest motive force, one that had been at work from the
   beginning of the Apostolic Age, was the supreme reverence in which the
   words and teaching of Christ Jesus were held. I have purposely used the
   expression "supreme reverence," for in the ideas of those days
   inspiration and authority had their degrees. Not only were the spirits
   of the prophets subject to the prophets, but there were recognised
   degrees of higher and highest in their utterances. Now there can be no
   doubt that for the circle of disciples the Word of Jesus represented
   the highest degree. He Himself had often introduced His message with
   the words "I am come" (i.e. to do something which had not yet been
   done), or, "But I say unto you" (in opposition to something that had
   been hitherto said). This claim received its complete recognition among
   the disciples in the unswerving conviction that the words and
   directions of Jesus formed the supreme rule of life. Thus side by side
   with the writings of the Old Testament appeared the Word of "the Lord,"
   and not only so, but in the formula graphai kai ho kurios [6] the two
   terms were not only of equal authority, but the second unwritten term
   received a stronger accent than the first that had literary form. We
   may therefore say that in this formula we have the nucleus of the New
   Testament. But even in the Apostolic Age and among the Palestinian
   communities it had become interchangeable with the formula hai graphai
   kai to euangelion [7] for in the "Good News" was comprised what the
   Messiah had said, taught, and revealed. [8] These two almost identical
   formulæ, though they do not as yet distinguish the followers of Jesus
   from ideal Judaism, nevertheless mark a breach with Judaism as it
   actually existed. [9]

   (2) The second motive, manifested with peculiar force in St Paul, but
   by no means exclusively in him, is the interest in the Death and
   Resurrection of the Messiah Jesus, an interest which necessarily led to
   the assigning of supreme importance to, and to the crystallisation of
   the tradition of, the critical moments of His history. Under the
   influence of this motive "the Gospel" came to mean the good news of the
   Divine plan of Salvation, proclaimed by the prophets, and now
   accomplished through the Death and Resurrection of Christ; [10] and it
   would be felt that an account of the critical moments of the life of
   Christ must take its place side by side with the Old Testament history
   regarded as prophetic. [11] Then at once there must have arisen among
   Christians the desire and endeavour to prove the concordance of
   prophecy and fulfilment in order to establish their own faith and
   confute the unbelief of the Jews. Thus the Church had just as much need
   of an historical tradition concerning Jesus as of the Old Testament;
   and a comparison point by point of prophecy and fulfilment was also an
   absolute requisite. These requirements were still covered by the
   formula hai graphai kai ho kurios (or to euangelion), but the concept
   ho kurios (to euangelion) demanded now, in addition to the moral (and
   eschatological) sayings of Jesus, an historical record. With this stage
   of development correspond our Gospels, or rather the many Gospels of
   which St Luke still speaks. That they were many in itself proves not
   only the acuteness of the need for them, but also the carelessness that
   prevailed in the matter of authenticity. It was not the author's
   authority that at first carried these writings, but their own content.
   By the historical element of this literature the separation between the
   Churches and the Synagogue was set in yet stronger relief than by the
   Didache literature; for the latter could still connect with Jewish
   ethic, and was as a matter of fact developed from it (cf. "The Two
   Ways"), whereas the historical literature laid emphasis upon everything
   that was to the Jews a "scandalon," and thus established and widened
   the cleft between them and the Christian bodies. Under the influence of
   the second motive, together with the first, the formula "The Holy
   Scriptures and the Lord" was transformed into "The Holy Scriptures and
   the (written Gospels) or the (written) Gospel," [12] The historical
   situation in the Churches that corresponded to this new formula was
   that which preceded the creation of the New Testament. [13]

   (3) The third motive belongs quite essentially to St Paul and to those
   who learned from him. It finds expression in such words as these:
   "Christ is the end of the Law," "The Law is given by Moses, Grace and
   Truth came through Jesus Christ," and the like. Pauline Christians, and
   many that were not Pauline, were convinced that what Christ had brought
   with Him, in spite of its connection with the Old Testament, was
   something "new" and formed a "New Covenant." The conception of the "New
   Covenant" necessarily suggested the need of something of the nature of
   a document; for what is a covenant without its document? An enthusiast
   like Ignatius could indeed exclaim: Emoi archeia estin Iesous Christos,
   ta athikta archeia ho stauros autou kai ho thanatos kai he anastasis
   autou, [14] but the quite exaggerated paradox of the statement of
   itself teaches us that it could never become common property. No; if
   the handwriting that was against us is torn in pieces then there must
   be a new handwriting which is for us! If the written Law is abolished
   then the written Grace and Truth must appear in its place. And yet we
   notice that at first neither with St Paul nor the others is there any
   demand for a new document. Why not? Just because they thought that they
   possessed it already in the Old Testament, in those prophetical
   passages to which they gave the widest compass. By introducing into the
   ancient Scriptures themselves the distinction, indeed the opposition,
   between the Law and the Gospel, by finding this distinction in all
   those passages which speak of something "new," of a new Covenant, of a
   First and a Second and the like, of an extension of the Covenant to the
   Gentiles, they felt that they already possessed the written document of
   the new message of salvation, the authority they required. [15]

   But now a certain ambiguity, or at least an appearance of such, appears
   on the scene. Even St Paul is grievously affected by it. Where lies the
   boundary between Law and Prophets? Which is the Old and which is the
   New? Is it that everything in the Old Testament is new, and that there
   is only need of a right understanding to spy the "New" everywhere? Is
   thus the "Old" in the "Old Testament" merely a mischievous phantom that
   emanates from the stubborn unintelligence of the Jews? [16] Or is it
   that all in the Old Testament is indeed "New," but God has, for
   pedagogic reasons, veiled it with the appearance of the "Old"--indeed
   not only with the appearance, but with the "Old" itself, in
   accommodation with the character of the Jew; and that now, through
   Christ, all is unveiled for the Christian. [17] Or is a sharp
   distinction to be drawn between the moral and the ceremonial Law--the
   latter is abrogated, the former still in force? Or is the "New" a
   higher stage of development that does not deny its relationship to the
   "Old," but in a sense supplements it, or deepens the meaning and gives
   greater stringency to the demand, or lightens the yoke of the Old? Or,
   finally, are all these suppositions false? Is the "Old" absolutely and
   completely abolished be-cause it was a grievous error ever to have
   regarded the Old Testament as the Word of God? There never was an "Old
   Covenant," and the Old Testament is thus unmasked: it is the work of
   Jews and, as such, is to be despised or even condemned.

   Such were the difficulties which oppressed with ever-increasing weight
   the Christian in his controversy with the Jew and the Gnostic, and,
   above all, were a source of irritation to the life of the Churches and
   dominated the thought of their intellectual leaders (between A.D. 60
   and 160). What way of deliverance from these perplexities was open?
   They needed an authoritative document, a document which, because it
   gave a priori the right standpoint, decided these questions once and
   for all. But where was such a document to be found? The "correct"
   standpoint between Jew and Jewish Christian on the one hand and Marcion
   and Gnosticism on the other was given, in the firm determination of the
   important Churches to abide, with the original Apostles and St Paul,
   faithful to the Old Testament, and yet at the same time to appeal to
   written fundamental writings that testified to the transcendent claim
   of the New Covenant, and gave written authority to the "legisdatio in
   libertatem" in contrast to the "legisdatio in servitutem" of the same
   God. [18] No one that reads Justin's Dialogue with Typho but can
   receive the liveliest impression that the author is simply crying for a
   New Testament; but, seeing that he cannot produce it directly as a
   fundamental document he is compelled to write endless chapters and
   laboriously to construct it himself from the Old Testament and the
   history of Jesus (the Gospels)! If he could have quoted as the Word of
   God in strict sense one only of the dozens of appropriate passages in
   St Paul, and could have been able to refer to books of the "New
   Covenant"--how much simpler and shorter his whole task would have
   become!

   (4) The fourth and last motive derives from the problem presented to
   the Church since the second century by the presence of a considerable
   Christian literature. A mass of Christian works had come into existence
   of extremely varied content (especially the Gnostic writings), some of
   which advanced high claims to authority and often afforded grievous
   scandal to simple believers. What is admissible, what is not
   admissible? What corresponds to Orthodoxy ("Orthognomy," Justin)? what
   contradicts it? What is "Catholic," and what not?--These were questions
   which became ever more burning, and necessitated an authoritative
   selection of what was trustworthy and good. And, besides, the more time
   advanced the more one was driven to distinguish between the "New" and
   the "Old"; for the Christian religion experienced what every
   religion--and every religious community--experiences--it began to
   worship its own past. The more perplexing, troublous, and feeble its
   present appeared, the more precious and sacred became its own past, the
   time of creative energy, with all that belonged thereto. Necessarily,
   therefore, the process of selection was governed, not only by the
   criterion "Catholic," but also by the criterion "Old," to which the
   more definite name "Apostolic" came to be attached. But what had been
   selected as orthodox and "Catholic" possessed as such a certain
   authority, which was still further enhanced if the additional predicate
   "Apostolic" ("old ") could be attached to it. [19] The result of the
   working out of this fourth motive would therefore quite necessarily
   combine with what was demanded by the third motive: in the "Catholic"
   and "Apostolic" would be found fundamental, authoritative documents of
   the New Covenant.

   We have now sketched the embryonic history of the New Testament in its
   leading motives. [20] This history led to written gospels on the one
   hand, and on the other hand to the demand for a fundamental document of
   the New Covenant that would confute both Jewish Christian and Gnostic
   alike. Moreover, it led also to the demand that the orthodox (Catholic)
   writings should be separated from the mass of upstart, misleading
   works, and that at the same time special honour should be paid to all
   that was "old" (Apostolic). These needs and requirements would of
   themselves suggest the standard by which such books were chosen; but
   the task must have been easier in places where "Apostolic" articles of
   faith had become firmly established, and so a fixed standard for
   selection had been set up. [21] Thus an Old Testament with Christian
   interpretation or an enriched Old Testament no longer sufficed; for
   neither the one nor the other fulfilled the needs that had grown up and
   now imperiously asserted themselves. In the motives which we have
   described the New Testament exists in embryo.

   (B) But whence came the authority which was necessary for such a
   production? Three points are here to be considered.

   In the first place, in primitive Christendom, though every Christian
   was believed to have received the Spirit, certain members were regarded
   as being specially inspired, as being "bearers of the Spirit" kat'
   exochen. The directions of these "Apostles, Prophets, and Teachers"
   could not but be simply accepted and obeyed. [22] Though, on the one
   hand, their existence and activity might mean a hindrance to the
   formation of an authoritative written canon--for what need was there of
   Scriptures when one had living authorities?--yet, on the other hand,
   they might act as promoters; for if they gave any directions concerning
   written works, these also could not but be obeyed. In these "bearers of
   the Spirit" the Churches thus possessed, until far into the second
   century, authorities that could create what was new and could give to
   the new the seal of prescription. If in later days the bishop was asked
   what ought to be read in public, [23] there is no doubt that at earlier
   times the same question was addressed to the "Apostle" or the "Prophet"
   or the "Teacher," and that their authority sufficed.

   In the second place, every circle of Christians that met together in
   the name of Jesus Christ and gave a direction or made a decision, felt
   and knew that it had the Holy Spirit or, in other words, the power of
   the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. v. 4) as leader and supporter. The formulæ: "The
   Holy Spirit and we have decided" (Acts xv. 28), or "What we have said,
   God has said through us" (1 Clem. ad Cor. 59), or "We have spoken or
   written through the Holy Spirit" (1 Clem. ad Cor. 63), were in constant
   use. But the Church in its solemn assembly was especially an organ of
   the Holy Spirit; and Sohm in his Kirchenrecht (vol. i.) is right in
   making this conception the source of the absolute powers of the
   "Synods," which indeed had developed from the Church assembly. [24]
   These powers extended also to the determination of what writings were
   to be accepted or rejected, publicly read or excluded. From this
   standpoint we can comprehend the peremptory expressions of the
   Muratorian Fragment ("recipi non potest"; "recipimus"; "legi oportet";
   "se publicare in finem temporum non potest"; "nihil in totum
   recipimus"; ["rejicimus"]); or the similar statements of Tertullian:
   "non recipitur" (Apoc. Enoch); "a nobis quidem nihil omnino rejiciendum
   est quod pertineat ad nos"; [25] "penes nos [istæ scripturæ]
   apocryphorum nomine damnantur"; [26] "certi sumus nihil recipiendum
   quod non conspiret germanæ paraturæ"; [27] "receptior apud ecclesias
   epistola Barnabæ" [28] --they are intended to be taken as decisions of
   the Churches. That, moreover, the judgment of the Churches concerning
   the admissibility of books to the sacred canon depended in some cases
   at least upon direct synodical decisions, is baldly stated by
   Tertullian (De Pudic., 10): "Sed cederem tibi, si scriptura Pastoris
   non ab omni concilio ecclesiarum, etiam vestrarum, inter apocrypha et
   falsa indicaretur." [29] The Community, therefore, in solemn assembly,
   and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, was felt to have the power
   to accept or not to accept into the Canon, and this power was also
   consciously exercised. [30]

   Thirdly and lastly, there is another circumstance that must not be
   overlooked. The greater became the distance in time from the
   Apostolical Age the more sacred became the series of writings that had
   Catholic character and Apostolic title, just because of these
   properties and the distance. They thus acquired such inward and outward
   authority that the Churches could not bring themselves to believe that
   they had the power either to accept or to reject them. [31] We have
   already touched upon the concept "Catholic"; in the next paragraphs we
   shall deal in more detail with the concept "Apostolic." Here we need
   only state the fact that the importance which everything
   "Apostolic-Catholic," either in content or in title, had acquired
   during the second century because of the Gnostic controversy was so
   great that in face of it the Churches felt that they had lost all right
   to decision and could only adopt a purely passive attitude. The
   decision is decision no longer, but mere acquiescence; they accept with
   all the consequences. Even in the case of Acta Pauli in Carthage, which
   Tertullian mentions, it cannot have been otherwise. When this book,
   which claimed to bring from the Apostolic Age a description of the
   history and teaching of St Paul, reached Carthage, it was as a matter
   of course accepted as having authority for the Church, and this
   practically meant that it was attached to the second collection of
   sacred writings that at that time already existed. One could only
   succeed in removing it from the Canon if one could unmask it and prove
   that it was a late and therefore a misleading work, and this is what
   Tertullian does. Naturally all would have been over with the book if it
   could have been convicted of heresy, but in this case that was not so
   easy.

   To sum up: At first, in the period when foundations were being laid,
   men were living who had the power to determine books as authoritative
   and who made use of their power as the need for such books arose. Then
   came a moment after which the collection of sacred books could only, so
   to speak, itself create or, rather, extend itself--namely, the moment
   when the conviction arose that every work that was Apostolic and
   Catholic belonged to an authoritative group. Other authorities could
   now have scarcely any voice in the matter, for once the
   Apostolic-Catholic character of a work was established the only right
   left to Christians was that of acquiescence. Nevertheless, in practice,
   this principle by no means established itself quite securely and
   absolutely. In the first place, the concept "Apostolic" was by no means
   clear. Did it imply the Twelve Apostles alone? or the Twelve and other
   Apostolic persons? or the Apostolic Age generally? And, secondly, as we
   shall see immediately, another and an incommensurable factor was
   involved, namely, the factor of Custom.

   (C) The third question which we have yet to consider is the
   question--Supposing the necessity in idea of the New Testament, how did
   it come into actual existence? Motives by themselves do not create, and
   even if authority is at hand with power to realise motives, still there
   is always need of practical conditions in order to give life and form
   to what is possible and desirable. Such practical conditions were,
   however, present. In the first place, there existed a body of writings
   that was more or less fitted to satisfy the requirements--the Gospels
   at the earlier date, and in the following period every work that was
   old (Apostolic) and Catholic as well. But this was not enough to make
   them formally Scriptures of a Second Covenant. Justin, indeed, with a
   certain Christian assurance, speaks not only of "our doctrines," but
   also of "our writings" (Apol., i. 28) side by side with the Old
   Testament, but as yet he knows nothing of Scriptures of the "New
   Covenant."

   But he knew--and this is the second point--of a practice, in use in the
   Churches, of reading aloud in public worship the "memorabilia of the
   Apostles" (the Gospels) or the "writings of the prophets." [32] Here we
   light upon the fact that was of supreme importance for the realisation
   of the idea of the New Testament. Above all, it was because Christian
   writings were in public worship actually treated like the Old
   Testament, [33] without being simply included in the body of the old
   Canon, that the idea of a second sacred collection could be realised.
   [34] This was the case in the first place with the Gospels. In actual
   practice these writings gradually came to be treated in the same way as
   the Old Testament, and so for half a century they stood side by side
   with the ancient Scriptures, and very soon with a dignity practically
   equal to that of the Old Testament. But we have sure evidence that
   other writings were likewise read at public worship, though perhaps not
   at first as a regular practice; for Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth (about
   A.D. 170), tells us that the Corinthian Christians still continued to
   read in public worship the epistle written by Clement from the Roman
   Church about A.D. 95, and that they would likewise read the new letter
   which they had just received from Rome. [35] If this happened in the
   case of important letters between Churches, what doubt can there be
   that it was so also above all with the epistles of St Paul--so unique,
   so incomparable --in Corinth and Rome, in Philippi and Thessalonica, in
   Ephesus, Hierapolis, and Colossæ, and not only in these places but
   wherever collections of Pauline epistles had arrived. [36] They would
   certainly be read publicly though not with the same regularity as the
   Gospels, and not as an alternative to the Scriptures of the Old
   Testament. The Johannine Apocalypse too, in its present form, dating
   from the last days of Domitian, was edited for reading in the Church
   (i. 3) and naturally not for a single reading only, which would have
   been quite profitless. [37] And though what was read is not indeed yet
   he graphe, still it could not but gradually come very near to the
   graphe in the estimation of hearers who heard it again and again read
   aloud side by side with the Old Testament. [38] This explains how it
   happens that before the rise of the New Testament isolated instances
   occur in which the Gospel is quoted with gegraptai, [39] or in which a
   passage from a Pauline Epistle is adduced, together with passages from
   the Old Testament, as a quotation from Scripture. [40] On the other
   hand, it ought not to be overlooked that, through this practice of
   public lection, usages would necessarily be formed in the separate
   Churches which, in that they affected the development of the future New
   Testament, created differences that had necessarily to be overcome if
   any unity was to be attained. So far as the "lectio" allowed usages to
   arise side by side with the reading of the Old Testament, it
   unconsciously prepared the way for a second sacred collection, but it
   could neither dot the "i" nor lead to unity.

   Public Lection was unquestionably a particularly strong agent in
   establishing the second sacred collection however little it was
   qualified to create inward unity of choice and to determine the limits
   of a Canon. But when one has mentioned public lection one must also
   remember another factor, quite remote and different in character, that
   most probably played a part here. It is well known that the reformer
   Marcion (scarcely later than A.D. 140), who rejected the Old Testament,
   gave to his Church a collection of sacred writings consisting of a
   critical edition of the Lucan Gospel and ten Pauline Epistles (likewise
   critically edited); and that he assigned to this collection the same
   authority that the Old Testament possessed among the Jews and the
   Christians of the greater Churches. [41] It is also well known that
   about the same time Gnostic sects, which likewise rejected the Old
   Testament, appealed to Gospels and Pauline Epistles as an authentic
   instrumentum doctrinæ. [42] The idea and the realisation of a new,
   sacred, specifically Christian collection of writings, in addition to
   the Gospels, appears first among the Marcionites and the Gnostics--and
   quite naturally; for, seeing that they rejected the Old Testament, they
   were compelled to set up another litera scripta in its place. That
   which could only arise in the Church as the result of a complicated
   process of development, because at first the Old Testament was a
   formidable obstacle, this naturally and necessarily makes its
   appearance in the heretical sects, because without some such second
   sacred collection they would have possessed absolutely no instrumentum
   doctrinæ. Can we think that this step had any influence upon the great
   Churches? They could hardly have allowed themselves to be consciously
   influenced; but in history conscious influences are by no means the
   only influences, nor are they the strongest. [43] The simple and
   notorious fact that a new sacred collection was in existence among
   those heretics must have worked upon the Church as effectually as the
   composition of the Lutherian Catechism and of the articles and other
   professions of faith of the Reformers influenced the Roman Catholic
   Church in the sixteenth century. [44] In the next sections we shall go
   more closely into the question of Marcion's Bible; for its inner
   arrangement and its division into Gospel and Apostles in their
   significance for the formation of the New Testament of the Church must
   be considered, and, as we shall see, our conjecture that here also
   influence has come into play will be confirmed. But stronger than this
   positive influence must have been the influence of the antagonism to
   which the Church was aroused by Marcionism. This also would suggest the
   idea of Apostolic-Catholic. All such writings must be collected and
   compiled in opposition to what was false and spurious.

   The fact that most valuable, important, and primitive Christian
   writings were at hand, further, the practice of public reading, and,
   lastly, the examples of the Marcionites and Gnostics, which must have
   provoked both imitation and opposition, explain how the motives, which
   suggested the origin of the Church's New Testament, could realise
   themselves, and how the authorities that could create it came into
   action. But we must still take another fact into consideration before
   we can understand how the collection of works came to be the "Canon of
   the New Covenant."

   A simple "collection" of writings need not be final; rather it can even
   more or less purposely be left open, especially if it serves ends (such
   as public reading) which do not forbid enrichment from the stores of
   the present. And yet a collection of fundamental documents has already
   the tendency to become final, and certainly a collection of fundamental
   documents of a Covenant carries in itself the idea of complete
   finality. It is also certain that a compilation of writings is always
   in danger of disintegration if it is not in some way limited, in idea
   at least. A hundred years ago Novalis advanced the very reasonable
   question: "Who declared the Bible (the Canon of the New Testament) to
   be closed?" Our answer to the question is: The idea, firmly held, that
   the new books were fundamental documents of the Second Covenant which
   God had established through Jesus Christ, was the intellectual
   originator of the "closed" instrumentum novum. When, then, did the idea
   of the New Covenant come to be firmly grasped? Now no one could have
   had a more strongly practical and historical hold upon it than the
   Apostle Paul (vide supra); yet he never thought of "books" of the
   Covenant, nor was he in a position to distinguish a classical
   Covenant-time from the lime that came afterwards. Gradually, however,
   new "books" appeared, as we have seen, and gradually with the advance
   of time the idea ever more strongly insinuated itself that the
   Apostolic Age, with all that belonged to it, was classical; it set up
   an authoritative model of perfection to which subsequent ages could no
   longer attain.

   Then the Montanist movement made its appearance and, with all the force
   of primitive energy, struggled against the Christian mediocrity that
   veiled itself in this assumed humility. Far from allowing that the
   highest lay in the past and was now only inherited as an "objective"
   legacy, the Montanists proclaimed that the highest both in revelation
   and in doctrine had now first arrived in the Paraclete, and that no
   final covenant of unapproachable sanctity had been given in the
   Apostolic Age, but that continually and increasingly the Novum and
   Novissimum reveals itself in prophecy, vision, and admonition. [45] It
   was in opposition to this position that the leaders of the Church first
   thought out and developed the idea of a covenant established and
   finally sealed in the manifestation of Christ and in the work of His
   Apostles, so that they were able to consistently reject every work
   which did not belong to this primitive epoch. By this procedure the
   Testamentum Novum (as a collection of the books of the New Covenant)
   was really first firmly established and forthwith finally limited in
   conception at least. The era of enthusiasm was closed, and, so far as
   the present time was concerned, the Spirit--using Tertullian's words
   (Adv. Prax., 1)--was actually chased away--chased into a book! [46]
   Naturally it was a long, long time before all was brought to a firm
   conclusion--there were too many "usages" and other variations still to
   be overcome--but since the end of the Montanist controversy, and
   entirely as a result of that controversy, the collection of the books
   of the New Covenant stands complete in idea. In this connection it is
   therefore not by accident that we first find the expression "the books
   of the Old Covenant" [47] used by Melito, Bishop of Sardis, about A.D.
   170-180, a native of Asia Minor and an opponent of the Montanists. We
   may with the greatest probability conclude that one who used this
   expression already recognised a collection of works as books of the New
   Covenant. What books these were cannot be ascertained so long as we
   must bewail the loss of the works of Melito, yet this is not a matter
   of the first importance. The one fact of decisive importance is that he
   does actually know books under such a title. And Melito, with his
   knowledge of "Books of the New Testament," does not stand alone in Asia
   Minor. The anonymous anti-Montanist of Euseb., H.E., v. 16, 3 (about
   A.D. 192--193) writes: dedios kai exeulaboumenos me te doxo tisin
   episungraphein e epidiatassesthai to tes tou euangeliou kaines
   diathekes logo ho mete prostheinai mete aphelein dunaton to kata to
   euangelion auto politeuesthai proeremeno. [48] The fear that the
   publishing of a written work might awaken the suspicion that one wished
   to add something to the doctrine of the New Covenant as given in the
   Gospel could not have arisen unless writings of the New Covenant, and
   these not only Gospels, were already in existence. Of equal importance
   is the evidence afforded by Tertullian. This writer, who as a Catholic
   churchman and opponent of heresy and as a Montanist is always in
   conflict with himself, on the one hand, when he, writing in cool blood,
   uses the expression Novum Testamentum or libri Novi Testamenti, on the
   other hand, in all the excitement of controversy he denounces in his
   prologue to the Passio Perpetuæ those Churchmen who proclaim a New
   Testament finally closed, and would therefore grant no place in it, or
   side by side with it, to the contemporary utterances of the novissima
   prophetia. All goes to show that, though the Gnostic crisis did indeed
   create the idea of Apostolic-Catholic as applied to writings, and
   brought about a selection of works which included the whole material of
   the future New Testament, it was the Montanist, not the Gnostic crisis,
   that brought the idea of the New Testament to final realisation and
   created the conception of a closed Canon. The Muratorian Fragment sets
   the seal as it were to the decision of the Church never to admit a
   later (non-Apostolic) writing into the New Testament, when it declares
   that "the Shepherd" of Hermas, who wrote "nuperrime temporibus
   nostris," ought not "in finem temporum" to be received into the sacred
   Canon, and by the almost insulting severity of its rejection of
   Montanus: "Una cum Basilide (!) Asianum Cataphrygum constitutorem
   [rejicimus]." [49] Although the author of the Fragment expressly leaves
   the Canon of Apostolic writings still open--for him only the writings
   of the Old Testament prophets form a "completus numerus" (line 79), not
   the writings of the "Apostles"--yet in fact he so good as closes it
   completely; for, according to his theory, acceptance could be granted
   only to those Apostolic writings that hitherto had been accidentally
   overlooked.

   Thus the second Canon came to take its place beside the first. The
   first was preserved because the God of Salvation was felt to be also
   the God of Creation, and because Christians following St Paul held fast
   to the historical conception that the Covenant given in Jesus Christ
   was preceded not only by prophecies but also by a Covenant, naturally
   imperfect because suited to the childhood of mankind. This conception
   has an artificial touch of which it can only be relieved if one gives
   it the universal form of the "Education of mankind" and strips it of
   particularistic traits; and it would probably not have held its ground,
   and the Old Testament would have perished in the Church as it did among
   the Gnostics, if the book had not been so indispensable for
   Apologetics. So long as the truth of religions was measured by their
   age the apologist simply could not do without the Old Testament. With
   it he could prove that Christianity went back to the creation of
   mankind. How could he forgo so great an advantage that was only to be
   gained through the preservation and recognition of the Old Testament!

   Naturally the Old Testament could only continue in force under the
   condition that, while its essential equality with the new Canon, as
   shown in prophecy and through the employment of allegorical
   interpretation, was recognised, yet from a second point of view it was
   regarded as inferior. This is at once clear from the works of Irenæus
   the first ecclesiastical author that operates with the two Canons. The
   Old Testament as "legisdatio in servitutem" has become inferior since
   the appearance of Christ. The books of the "legisdatio in libertatem"
   outshine it and throw it into the background. And though Irenæus does
   not yet know of a closed second Canon and though he does not assign to
   it the name "the books of the New Covenant," still in his exposition he
   proceeds as if it were already closed--the name only is wanting, the
   thing itself is practically in existence for him. The books of the new
   collection are on the one hand the documents of the New Covenant and on
   the other hand the Apostolic-Catholic books of the Church. [50] Because
   they are the latter they are also the former and vice versa. With these
   lofty predicates the New Testament was given in the sense in which it
   has remained in force unto the present day. [51]

   [5] St Paul himself offered a rich collection of such Christian
   interpretations, although he, as a rule, allowed to the Law its literal
   sense.

   [6] (The Scriptures and the Lord.) I cannot be persuaded that "the
   Lord" as a title of Jesus was first conceived on Gentile-Christian
   soil. The idea of "Messiah" simply includes that of "Lord." The formula
   "The Scriptures and the Lord" has manifold attestation direct as well
   as indirect in the Apostolic and post-Apostolic epoch.

   [7] (The Scriptures and the Gospel.)

   [8] It is a waste of time to discuss which of the two formulæ, hai
   graphai kai ho kurios or hai graphai kai to euangelion, is the earlier.
   Concerning "evangelium" and the earliest history of the conception, I
   refer to my book Entstehung und Entwickelung der Kirchenverfassung
   (1910), S. 199-239, especially S. 224 ff.

   [9] We must cry halt for a moment, for the historian of the New
   Testament in order to gain a more exact conception of what actually
   happened must survey what might have happened. If the motive here
   described could have had free course, undisturbed by other motives, we
   should have expected that a collection of authoritative sayings of
   Jesus loosely compiled or in more connected form, and at the most
   enriched by some eschatological elements, would have taken its place
   beside the Old Testament. And for a time this is what actually happened
   both in the case of the looser and more connected forms. In the
   compilation Q that lies behind the Gospels of St Matthew and St Luke we
   have an example of the looser form, and in the Christian version of
   "The Two Ways" of the more connected form. The latter work, in the form
   which it has received in the "Didache," is especially interesting,
   because in it an attempt is made to base not only the ethics but also
   the most important institutions of the Christian communities (such as
   Baptism, Prayer, Fasting, the Eucharist, the rules of life, etc.) upon
   sayings of Jesus, and thus to give the whole Christian position an
   "evangelical" foundation, so that it should not depend on the Old
   Testament as its sole written authority. Lastly, this ancient Didache,
   in so far as it claims to be both "Teaching of the Lord" and "Teaching
   of the Apostles," (Didache kuriou dia ton ib apostolon) also implies
   that relative identification of Christ and the Apostles which, as we
   shall see, was the most essential condition of the origin of the New
   Testament. Thus without exaggeration we may say that Q (in its earliest
   form), as well as the old Didache, aim in their own fashion at being a
   New Testament or "the New Testament." It was not outside the limits of
   possibility that Christendom should have produced as its "New
   Testament," nothing except a work like the "Didache" side by side with
   the Old Testament (and the Gospels). How nearly this happened we may
   judge from the important fact that, even after the New Testament was
   created, the production of works like the Didache, based upon the
   authority of the Lord and the Apostles (Constitutions, Canons, etc.),
   continued up to the fifth and sixth centuries. The motive which led to
   this authoritative literature is thus older than those which led to the
   New Testament. When we take up works like the "Apostolic Canons" we
   should remember that we are dealing with rivals of the New Testament,
   in idea more ancient and venerable than the New Testament itself, in
   spite of their wild and audacious development of that idea.

   [10] A change also takes place in the concept of ho kurios. In this
   term Christ is now regarded from the point of view of His nature and
   acts rather than as the teacher divinely commissioned.

   [11] The scope of the record to which this feeling led was at first
   purely arbitrary. The plan of the Markan Gospel shows most clearly that
   the chief interest lay in the Story of the Death and Resurrection. If
   the teaching of Christ was to be combined with this story it was
   necessary to give some kind of preliminary history. This is what St
   Mark gives. But what he gives is to the very smallest extent determined
   by interest in the fulfilment of prophecy--simply because the material
   to hand was so insignificant in this respect (yet see what St Matthew
   tries to do with it). It was not until courage was found to pass from
   this preliminary history (the story of our Lord's teaching and
   wonderful works) to what we to-day call "preliminary history" (Matt.
   i.-ii.; Luke i., ii., etc.) that the scheme, "Fulfilled Prophecy,"
   could be so forcibly applied, as it was already in the story of the
   Death and Resurrection, and then for the most part to facts that
   happened because they were wanted.

   [12] Accordingly the Gospels were also called "The Scriptures of the
   Lord": see Dionysius Cor. (c. A.D. 170) in Euseb., H.E., iv. 23, 22
   (Clem. Alex. and Tertullian).

   [13] Here also it is well to halt for a moment. If the above mentioned
   motive together with the first had had free course, without any
   interference from new motives, the result must have been as follows:
   either a written gospel (like our Gospels) would have taken its place
   beside the Old Testament with all the dignity which its content
   afforded or, on the other hand, a compilation of concordances of Old
   Testament prophecies and events in the history of Jesus (together with
   some work like Q or like the Didache). The first alternative, as is
   well known, came into being. The Jewish-Christian Churches, as long as
   they lasted, added one written gospel, the "Gospel of the Hebrews," or
   the "Gospel of the Ebionites," to the Old Testament, and nothing else.
   It is also conceivable that the Egyptian Churches during part of their
   history had only a Gospel in addition to the Old Testament. It is,
   moreover, certain that many important Churches for about half a century
   (c. 130-170 or 180) set one Gospel (perhaps several--we need not
   discuss this at present) beside the Old Testament, and that in the
   Syrian and Arabian Churches this state of affairs lasted until the
   middle of the third century. We are here concerned only with
   establishing these facts. Whether these Gospels were valued for their
   content only, or whether form and the authority of the author were
   already of importance, and what was the exact relation in which they
   stood to the Old Testament--these also are questions which lie for the
   moment outside our scope. In any case it is clear that it was not only
   not outside the limits of possibility, but that the circumstances
   rather suggested that a permanent "New Testament" should have arisen
   comprising only a Gospel (one or several). It is possible to ask
   whether the course of the Church's history would not have been simpler
   if she had kept to a Gospel or to the Gospels as her "New Testament."
   But would not the Old Testament have been too strong in the Church if
   she had been obliged to dispense with the Pauline Epistles? To ask the
   question means to answer it in the affirmative. The Johannine Gospel
   could not have performed the absolutely necessary service that the
   canonised Paul has performed for the Church--still less St Mark or St
   Luke. As for the second possibility that instead of our Gospels and the
   Pauline Epistles we should have received only a compilation of
   concordances between prophecies and fulfilments (with or without
   Q)--here, too, there is no lack of attempts in this direction. Such
   compilations existed as is shown by the works of Justin when compared
   with other works (from the Acts of the Apostles onwards). Note
   especially the Eklogai of Melito (Euseb., H.E., iv. 26, 13 f. ),
   unfortunately lost to us; it was made up of "extracts from the Law and
   the Prophets concerning the Saviour and our whole Faith." There was no
   small danger that Christians should have remained satisfied with such
   concordances, and that development on these lime would have resulted in
   a cramped and superficial New Testament. Fortunately, however, none was
   skilful enough to find a satisfactory form for this conception. Hence
   it has always remained formless in the Church; and, so far as I can
   see, it is owing to this fact that from this quarter the New Testament
   met with no such rival as it confessedly met with in the Didache
   writings (vide supra). We shall discuss later the fact that Marcion was
   fortunate enough to find a form for the opposite undertaking in his
   Antitheses, and assigned to this work canonical authority.

   [14] (As for me, my documents are Jesus Christ--the unquestionable
   documents, His Cross and His Death and Resurrection.) Phil., 8.

   [15] See especially the Epistle of Barnabas, and Justin.

   [16] This is the view of the author of the Epistle of Barnabas.

   [17] This is the common view shared by Justin.

   [18] This meant the rejection of the views of "Barnabas" (an Old
   Covenant is a Jewish mistake), of Marcion and the Gnostics (the
   so-called Old Covenant together with the Old Testament is the work of
   another god), but also of the strict Jewish Christians (the "New
   Covenant" is essentially nothing new but is only the continuation and
   completion of the Old).

   [19] The task of selection was the more difficult in that, according to
   the earliest belief, he who speaks (or writes) of the Lord speaks under
   the influence of the Spirit of God (1 Cor. xii. 3; Didache iv. 1:
   hothen he kuriotes laleitai ekei kurios estin. Old-fashioned
   Tertullian, De Cultu, i. 3: "Omnis scriptura ædificationi habilis
   divinitus inspirata est"). To select and reject was, therefore, a
   matter of serious responsibility. Seen from this point of view the New
   Testament is, therefore, a "remainder-product," and the belief in its
   inspiration is a mere relic of the much richer conception that the
   Spirit of Christ (of God) initiated and overruled every sincere word of
   testimony to Himself. The New Testament is thus a Remainder-product,
   and at the same time a new creation (as a collection of
   Apostolic-Catholic writings). In the former character it was determined
   by rejection, in the latter by collection.

   [20] Motives which derived from the relations of the Churches with the
   surrounding heathen world can scarcely be included here. The apologists
   even after the creation of the New Testament found no need to change
   the old method of operating with the Old Testament alone, and only
   adding a little from the Gospel tradition. When dealing with heathen it
   was such an advantage to be able to appeal to scriptures of venerable
   antiquity that the new were left on one side; indeed Justin, one of the
   earliest apologists, makes more constant use of the new writings (the
   Gospels) and in controversy with the heathen thrusts them more
   conspicuously into the foreground, than any of his successors. The most
   important apologetic work of the primitive Church, Tertullian's
   Apologeticum, gives in reference to Christ only an historical sketch,
   which would necessarily have been understood by heathen to proceed from
   official "Acts of Pilate," while the Gospels are as good as ignored.
   Yet in making these remarks I do not wish to deny that in many
   particular cases of controversy of Christians with heathen it was not a
   great advantage to be able to appeal to a New Testament as well as to
   the Old Testament, and that complications must have occurred so long as
   this was not yet possible.

   [21] Here is the point where the question of the connection between the
   growing New Testament and the Creed presents itself--the problem which
   Lessing was the first to state clearly. His solution is correct in the
   sense that the Catholic standard of orthodoxy, or Rule of Faith, is
   more ancient than the New Testament, and exercised an important
   influence on its compilation. The Muratorian Fragment in several
   passages affords a direct proof that this was so; but even without this
   testimony the fact would be proved. Lessing, however, has not shown, or
   at any rate has not sufficiently clearly shown, that every collection
   of sacred documents has an innate and un-conquerable tendency to shake
   itself free from the conditions out of which it has arisen (cf. Second
   Part, § 1).

   [22] Cf. concerning these three, my Missionsgeschichte, 12, S. 267 ff.,
   and my Kirchenverfassung, S. 18 ff. Their connection with Jewish
   tradition need not here be discussed.

   [23] Vide e.g. Euseb., H.E., vi. 12, 4, where Serapion, bishop of
   Antioch at the time of Septimius Severus, gives an important decision
   concerning the Gospel of Peter.

   [24] When in after times Constantine and his successors revered the
   oecumenical synods as instruments of the Holy Spirit, and Justinian
   treated the decisions of the first four Councils as equal to the four
   Gospels, a principle was at work which can be justified from the early
   history of the Church.

   [25] De Cultu, i. 3.

   [26] De Anima, 2.

   [27] Loc. cit.

   [28] De Pudic., 20.

   [29] Also in De Baptism, 17, it is evidently the intention of
   Tertullian to bring about a decree of the Church which would annul the
   too hasty reception of the Acta Pauli as a genuine document.

   [30] Augustine speaks quite frankly (c. Faustum, xxii. 79) of "sancti
   at docti homines," as compilers of the New Testament ("Legunt
   scripturas apocryphas Manichæi, a nescio quibus sutoribus fabularum sub
   apostolorum nomine scriptas, quæ suorum scriptorum temporibus in
   auctoritatem sanctæ ecclesiæ recipi mererentur, si sancti et docti
   homines, qui tunc in hac vita erant et examinare talia poterant, eos
   vera locutores esse cognoscerent"). A valuable piece of information
   (cf. Origen, Præf. in Luc.)! The legends that the Apostles themselves,
   or the Apostle John, compiled the New Testament first appear in the
   Middle Ages, and are worthless. It is, therefore, surprising that
   Overbeck has no scruple in appealing to this very late legend to
   support his hypothesis concerning the predominant influence of "John"
   (i.e. of the Fourth Gospel) in the formation of the Canon of the
   Gospels (Das Johannesev., 1911, S. 486, "In ancient legends (!) in
   which John appears as the founder of the Canon of the Gospels, indeed
   sometimes of the whole Canon of the New Testament, one may well
   recognise an echo of the original course of events if this went as I
   suppose." S. 490: "There is in existence an ecclesiastical legend that
   the Apostle John was the founder of the Canon of the Gospels, indeed of
   the Canon generally. This legend, late though it is, and in content on
   the whole unacceptable, may, nevertheless, quite justly be appealed to
   as a confused historical reminiscence of an actual occurrence of
   Christian antiquity such as I have sketched.") With what scorn would
   Overbeck have overwhelmed a critic that had dared to take a similar
   legend so seriously!

   [31] We may imagine the process as follows: From the first ages, the
   ages of enthusiasm onwards, every Christian writing counted as
   "inspired" (vide supra). In course of time, as the number of Christian
   writings increased and their contents became ever more varied, this
   estimate of value, this feeling of reverence, became weaker and more
   vague. But now a new valuation according to the standard of the
   Apostolic-Catholic gradually won its way in the Church. But
   Apostolic-Catholic did not mean less divine. This change is only one
   symptom of the grand historical revolution from enthusiasm to
   ecclesiasticism, from the spirit to the letter combined with the
   spirit. Like prophecy in earlier days, all that was Catholic and
   Apostolic had to be accepted as authoritative, and no one could
   criticise it.

   [32] Apol., i. 67.

   [33] Note the "or."

   [34] Behind this public reading lay not only the historical motive but
   also the motive of moral and religious edification, as is proved by the
   sermon that regularly followed the lection, and, moreover, by the
   practice of private reading. Concerning the latter practice, see my
   book, Bible Reading in the Early Church (Williams & Norgate). Thus
   practical piety also had its share in the creation of the New
   Testament.

   [35] Euseb., H.E., iv. 23, 11.

   [36] Much intensive study has been devoted to the problem presented by
   the compilation of the thirteen (fourteen) Pauline epistles, with but
   meagre results. It is no longer possible to discover where the great
   final collection took place. From 1 Clement we may be sure that a
   collection of several epistles then existed in Rome, and was treated,
   so to speak, as public property of the Church. Twenty to thirty years
   later the collection was certainly in existence in several Churches far
   distant from one another. This is enough for our purpose.

   [37] Compare also the directions that Hermas gives in reference to the
   public reading of his book (Vis., ii. 4).

   [38] The inner relationship of "written word" with "lection" comes out
   strikingly in the prologue (by Tertullian) to the Passio Perpetuæ,
   which will occupy us again later. Here we read: "Si vetera fidei
   exempla, et dei gratiam testificantia et ædificationem hominia
   operantia, propterea in litteris sunt digesta, ut lectione eorum . . .
   et deus honoretur et homo confortetur, cur non et nova documenta æquo
   utrique causæ convenientia et digerantur? . . . Itaque et nos . . .
   prophetias et visiones novas . . . ad instrumentum ecclesiæ deputatas
   . . . necessario et digerimus et ad gloriam dei lectione celebramus."
   Yet it ought not to be overlooked that when Tertullian wrote these
   words the terms "the written word" and "lectio" had already probably a
   more exclusive relationship than they had sixty or even thirty years
   earlier. The farther back one goes the freer was the choice of what was
   read at public service.

   [39] (It is written.)

   [40] For the former, see Barn. iv. 14, and, later, 2 Clement ii. 4;
   xiii. 4; for the latter Polyc. xii. 1 (only preserved in the somewhat
   untrustworthy Latin version). The passage 2 Peter iii. 16 would be very
   important for the equation Pauline Epistles = Holy Scripture if the
   date of this late epistle could be more definitely determined. This
   transference of the authority of he graphe to isolated passages of
   evangelic writings (before there was as yet a New Testament) has its
   parallel in the quotations, with the formulæ legei or gegraptai, from
   Jewish or Christian apocalypses, that did not form part of the Canon.
   See Ephes. v. 14; 1 Clem. xxiii.; 2 Clem. xi., etc.

   [41] It is interesting that Marcion also added to his collection a work
   of his own as a canonical book--a work which he called Antitheses,
   showing the discordance between the Old Testament and the Gospel. That
   which nearly happened yet did not happen in the Church (vide supra),
   namely, the construction of a canonical book showing the concordance
   between the Old Testament and the Gospel history, happened with Marcion
   in the contrary sense, and his book seemed to him so important that he
   formally canonised it for his Church. Unfortunately we can form no
   clear impression of the form of this work because we only possess
   fragments of it. Catholic Christians must have regarded it as a regular
   work of the Devil. And indeed, from their point of view, a more evil
   and dangerous book could not have been imagined.

   [42] See the letter of Ptolemy to Flora which may well be taken in
   evidence for Valentinus himself, and other pieces of testimony as to
   the Valentinians, Basilideans, eta. Still, "the Lord" is always
   properly given the first place.

   [43] From this point of view we must doubtless admit that the motive of
   compulsion had a place in the creation of the New Testament. The Church
   was in a sense forced to take this step, and the step was not
   altogether to her advantage. We see this indeed quite clearly in
   Tertullian's treatise, De Præscript. Heret. The existence of the New
   Testament in itself and as a collection of equally authoritative books
   presented great difficulties to him in his polemic; for how could one
   prevent false interpretations, and how much there was in these writings
   that, taken literally, was actually questionable and had now to be
   justified by laborious interpretation (so with Irenæus, but the
   embarrassment is specially noticeable in Tertullian). The rather idle
   question whether apart from the conflict with heresy a New Testament
   would ever have come into existence is to be answered in the
   affirmative, for, as has been already suggested by our previous
   discussion, the idea of the New Covenant and the tendency to establish
   and confirm the idea would necessarily have resulted in calling the
   second sacred collection into being. This, however, does not prevent us
   from recognising that the New Testament as it stands and the history of
   its development bear traces of the element of compulsion. As an
   Apostolic-Catholic compilation it was constructed as a means of defence
   rather than of attack. If the point of view of the compilation had not
   been anti-Gnostic and Apostolic-Catholic the Acts of the Apostles would
   hardly have been included, the Johannine Apocalypse would almost
   certainly have been excluded, and the Pauline Epistles would have stood
   as a sort of appendix.

   [44] See my Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, 14, S. 380 f.: "The Church
   in excluding certain persons on the ground of apostolic rules of
   whatever kind, and in relation to the Old Testament, would not appear
   in a satisfactory position either in her own eyes or in the eyes of her
   opponents so long as she herself recognised that apostolic writings
   were in existence, and so long as these heretics appealed to apostolic
   writings. She was compelled to claim for herself everything that had a
   right to the name Apostolic,' to take it out of the hands of the
   heretics, and to show that with her it exists as authentic and stands
   in the highest esteem. Hitherto she had remained satisfied with proving
   her title from the Old Testament, and thus tracing herself, far past
   her real origin, back to the beginning of all things. Marcion, however,
   and the Gnostics first pointed out with tremendous emphasis that
   Christianity had its origin in Christ; that all that is Christian must
   actually satisfy the test of the (genuine) Apostolic teaching; that the
   assumed identity of Christian common sense with Apostolic Christianity
   did not exist; indeed (in the case of Marcion), that the Apostles
   themselves contradicted one another. By the last objection the Church
   was compelled to accept the field of battle chosen by her opponents.
   But the task of proving this contested identity was insoluble because
   every point upon which an argument could be based was a matter of
   controversy. Unconscious logic,' i.e. the logic of self-preservation,
   could point out one only way: the Church must collect everything that
   was Apostolic, declare herself to be its sole and rightful owner, and
   weld together the Apostolic so closely with the Canon of the Old
   Testament that for the future right interpretation was secured."
   Further, she would be compelled to set up a rule of faith as a rule for
   interpretation, and finally to assign to herself the sole right of
   interpretation.

   [45] It is scarcely necessary to say that Montanism with the claims
   that it advanced could never have arisen if a New Testament had been
   already in existence. (The same is true of the appearance of the
   so-called Algoi, who are still, according to my belief, to be placed in
   Asia Minor.)

   [46] The New Testament opens and legitimises the period of the
   Christendom of the second order or the period of legitimised
   Christianity. Prophets, to say nothing of Apostles, are now no longer
   possible, Hekastos echei charisma apo theou, ho men houtos, ho de
   houtos, hoi apostoloi de en pasi pepleromenoi (Clem. Alex., Strom., iv.
   21, 135). But again still more emphatically Tertullian--the same man
   who when he remembers his Montanism speaks so differently--writes (De
   Exhort., 4): "Spiritum quidem dei etiam fideles habent, sed non omnes
   fideles apostoli . . . proprie enim apostoli spiritum sanctum habent,
   qui plene habent in operibus prophetiæ . . . non ex parte, quod
   ceteri." Thus the Apostles have the Spirit proprie et plene like the
   Lord ! What real Christian could dare to compare himself with them, and
   how could a prophet possibly arise among those who thought thus! The
   New Testament, though not with one stroke, brought to an end the
   condition of things in which a chance Christian inspired by the Spirit
   could claim to give authoritative decisions and directions and could
   enrich with his fancy the history of the past and foretell the events
   of the future so as to command the faith of his hearers. Moreover,
   through the New Testament, it came to be recognised that the
   Christianity of the post-Apostolic epoch was only secondary and
   particular and, therefore, could never be authoritative nor serve as a
   standard. In refutation of an epistle of the Montanist Themison, who
   was also a Confessor--an epistle that was evidently addressed as a
   manifesto to the whole Church--the anti-Montanist, Apollonius, writes
   (Euseb., H.E., v. 18, 5); etolmesen, mimoumenos ton apostolon,
   katholiken tina suntaxamenos epistolen, katechein tous ameinon autou
   pepisteukotas. More will be said on this point in the second part.

   [47] Euseb., H.E., iv. 26, 14.

   [48] (In fear and dread, lest in writing I might seem to be adding to
   the injunctions of the Word of the New Covenant of the Gospel, to add
   to or to subtract from which is unthinkable for one who chooses to live
   in accordance with the Gospel itself.)

   [49] Montanus could be ranked with Basilides, because among the
   adherents of the latter two prophets, Barkoph and Barkabbas, stood in
   the highest honour.

   [50] Of the Church--ekklesiastikai graphai: this term now also makes
   its appearance. During the conflict with the Gnostics and Montanists,
   and because of the conflict, the Church had come to recognise that she
   belonged both to heaven and to earth. Before this she knew herself only
   as something heavenly, high, and exalted, now she feels that she
   belongs also to earth. The affinity between herself and the new Canon
   finds at once strong expression in the Muratorian Fragment: the New
   Testament is the book of the Church in opposition to heathen,
   heretics--and enthusiasts; the seven epistles of the Apocalypse and the
   epistles of St Paul to seven churches are in truth addressed to the one
   Church spread over all the world (lines 47-59); the epistles to
   Philemon, Titus, and Timothy are "in honore ecclesiæ"; for "in
   ordinatione ecclesiasticæ disciplinæ sanctificatæ sunt" (lines 59-63).
   Nothing false can be received "into the Catholic Church" (lines 63-68).
   The Epistle of Jude and the two epistles of John "in catholica
   habentur" (lines 68 f.). The Wisdom of Solomon was written "in honorem
   catholicæ" (so we must construe lines 69-71). The Apocalypse of Peter,
   "according to the view of some of our people," ought not to be read "in
   ecclesia" (lines 71-73). The Shepherd of Hermas should not be read
   aloud before the people "in ecclesia" (lines 73 ff.). The new
   collection belongs to the Church as an earthly as well as a heavenly
   entity, serves the ends of the Church, and becomes her book in the same
   sense (vide especially Origen) that the Old Testament was and is the
   book of the Jewish Theocracy.

   [51] Its text now at last (i.e. in the third century) became stable
   because the letter now had become most important. In the second century
   there was a fair amount of correction of the text of the Gospels even
   in orthodox communities. But seeing that the corrections were mostly
   due to conformation with the text of the other Gospels and doctrinal
   corrections were most infrequent, we have no right to conclude that the
   texts were still regarded as absolutely free for correction. Already at
   the time of Justin such a one as he would have certainly shrunk from
   laying a hand upon the Memorabilia of the Apostles, and Dionysius of
   Corinth complains only of the arbitrary correction made by heretics
   (Euseb., H.E., iv. 23, 12: epistolas adelphon axiosanton me graphai
   egrapsa, kai tautas hoi tou diabolou apostoloi zixanion gegemikan, ha
   men exairountes, ha de prestithentes; hois to ouai keitai. hou
   thaumaston ara ei kai ton kuriakon rhadiourgesai tines epibeblentai
   graphon, hopote kai tais ou toiautais epibebouleukasin. Conformation,
   however, did not count as correction. The transmission of the text of
   the Pauline Epistles is excellent. It is, moreover, interesting to see
   how long the Gospels, in spite of the creation of the New Testament,
   still kept in the foreground and occupied a certain separate position.
   Even at the beginning of the fourth century Alexander of Alexandria
   (Theodoret, H.E., i. 4) calls God the giver of the Law, the prophets,
   and the Gospels. This special distinction of the Gospels never quite
   ceased in the practice of the Church in public worship, especially in
   the East, and in connection with private reading. The enormous number
   of manuscripts of the Gospels, when compared with the manuscripts of
   the Apostolus, of itself proves this. Among Protestants this
   distinction between the two parts of the Canon has become more faintly
   marked than among the Catholic Churches; in this Protestantism has
   about it a touch of Marcionitism. Yet also of the Catholic Churches it
   is true that in hermeneutics and dogmatics "The Lord" is subsumed under
   "the Apostolic." It is partly otherwise only in Monasticism and in the
   theory of neo-Protestantism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Why is it that the New Testament also contains other books beside
   the Gospels, and appears as a compilation with two divisions
   ("Evangelium" and "Apostolus")?

   In the foregoing section hints have been given which prepare for the
   answering of this question; but the problem has not yet been set in
   clear light. How great it is must be realised by everyone who reflects
   only for a moment. In the New Testament letters which serve momentary
   and particular needs are set on a level of equal value with the
   Gospels; what is merely personal with what is of universal import; the
   Apostles with Christ; their work with His work! In a compilation which
   is invested with Divine authority we must read: "Drink a little wine
   for thy stomach's sake," and "my cloak I left at Troas." Side by side
   with the words of Divine mercy and loving-kindness in the Gospels we
   meet with outbreaks of passionate personal strife in the Epistles; side
   by side with the stories of the Passion and Resurrection, the dry notes
   of the diary of a missionary journey!

   He who would show how two absolutely disparate entities have yet come
   together can only solve the problem if he can prove that they form the
   extreme wings of a complex whole that is governed by an idea. The idea
   in question here is the idea of Tradition. One of the great problems
   which has silently dominated the inner history of the Church for
   centuries is the problem, "Scripture and Tradition." In the compilation
   of the New Testament this problem already, to a certain extent, found a
   solution; indeed, properly speaking, the strivings and conflicts that
   have taken place since this solution, i.e. since the creation of the
   New Testament, are all of them only of secondary import. The main
   battle was long since fought and decided in favour of Tradition when
   the New Testament was compiled and in the very fact of its compilation;
   but, unfortunately, historians have not yet generally recognised this
   truth. The New Testament itself, when compared with what Jesus
   purposed, said, and was, is already a tradition which overlies and
   obscures. When then we speak to-day of the antagonism and conflict
   between Scripture and Tradition, the tradition in question is a second
   tradition.

   The compilation of the New Testament out of the "Gospels," with their
   Apostolic titles and the "Apostolus," is clearly the expression of two
   convictions: (A) that in a certain sense the Apostles are equal to
   Christ in that they, being chosen not only to be His witnesses, but
   also dispensers of His power, are His continuation; and (B) that the
   attestation of a revelation is not less important than its content.
   When did these convictions make their appearance? How and under what
   circumstances did they attach themselves to books? How was it that
   under their influence the Acts of the Apostles came to be accepted into
   the Canon, and that such strong preference was given to St Paul?

   (A) Sceptical critics of the Synoptic Gospels have thought it necessary
   to disintegrate with special stringency the tradition concerning the
   relationship between our Lord and His twelve Disciples. [52] Indeed
   even the number twelve, and with it every special reference to "chosen"
   disciples, is objected to. In my opinion, criticism is here running on
   false lines. Sayings like: Ego diatithemai humin, kathos dietheto moi
   ho pater mou basileian, hina esthete kai pinete epi tes trapexes mou en
   te basileia mou, kai kathesthe epi thronon tas dodeka phulas krinontes
   tou Israel (St Luke xxii. 29 f.); [53] or Ho dechomenos humas eme
   dechetai, kai ho eme dechomenos dechetai ton aposteilanta me (St Matt.
   x. 40), the fundamental thought of which is found both in St Mark and
   in Q, cannot but be accepted as essentially trustworthy.

   There also appears to be no special reason to doubt that Jesus during
   His lifetime sent out twelve disciples on a mission in Palestine and
   that they actually undertook this mission and returned to Him again.
   All in all, sayings of Jesus must have existed that referred to the
   disciples as sent out on the mission, and that offered them the
   prospect of the highest authority and of even Messianic powers when the
   "Kingdom" was established. On this supposition alone can we explain the
   authority of the Twelve in the Church.

   For the Twelve, after our Lord had departed from them and was
   glorified, played in reality an insignificant rôle. This is only
   intelligible on the assumption that an express command of Jesus to
   begin a mission in grand style after His death did not exist. As a
   matter of fact the Twelve remained in Jerusalem and, apart from
   awaiting the time when they would take up their office in the coming
   Kingdom, the building up of the Church in Jerusalem, of which task they
   were moreover soon relieved by James the Lord's brother, remained the
   sole object of their existence. We have no certain knowledge that any
   one of them, except St Peter and St John, ever went on mission; but
   there is no doubt that their authority as the Twelve remained firmly
   established, because they were regarded as the confidants of Jesus and
   as the future judges at the establishment of the Messianic Kingdom.
   [54]

   The recognition of the lofty status of the Twelve, an authority that
   was at first naturally bound up with that of the Mother Church in
   Jerusalem, went forth with St Paul and the other missionaries into the
   Gentile world. These spoke of the Twelve Apostles as of authorities for
   all that they in common brought with them from the motherland of the
   new movement, and also in part for that which they themselves built on
   that foundation. And so now appeared that strange phenomenon--the
   "Twelve Apostles" as the court of highest instance and of fundamental
   authority. Soon also the belief took shape that Christ had committed
   the continuation and expansion of His work to the Twelve once for all,
   and so completely, that every real mission is subordinate to them and
   receives from them its content and authority. [55] The Roman Church
   writes about A.D. 95: "The Apostles were made evangelists to us by the
   Lord Christ (mark well: the Apostles,' not Peter and Paul); Jesus the
   Christ was sent by God. Thus Christ is from God and the Apostles from
   Christ. He and they came into being in harmony from the will of God."
   [56] Since the end of the first century the Apostles already seemed to
   the Gentile Church like a multiplication of the Christ. [57] The Church
   is built upon them as a foundation: in the New Jerusalem the twelve
   foundation stones of the city wall bear the names of the twelve
   Apostles of the Lamb. [58] If one spoke of the commands of Christ, one
   added the Apostles. [59] What Serapion says at the beginning of the
   third century (Euseb., H.E., vi. 12, 3): hemeis kai Petron kai tous
   allous apostolous apodechometha hos Christon, [60] could certainly have
   been also said a hundred years earlier. Already, in Gal. iv. 14, we
   read: edexasthe me hos Christon Iesoun. "The choice and sending out of
   the Apostles (after the Resurrection)" found its way even into the
   Rules of Faith, [61] and we may say that simply by an accident of
   history it did not find a place in the ancient Roman Symbol. Passages
   from prophecy were alleged as foretelling it just as in the case of
   main incidents in the life of Jesus Himself. [62] Writers in Asia
   Minor, Rome, and Egypt (before A.D. 160) unite in their testimony on
   this point, and even the Gnostics shared in part this conception. [63]
   Everywhere the form in which the appeal to the Apostles, as the College
   of the Twelve, is couched proves that the idea in question was
   axiomatic. In my Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, 1^4, S. 179-184, and
   elsewhere, I have more fully investigated the origin and the
   significance of this court of appeal, second to and yet one with
   Christ, which now at once became the vessel that received "Tradition"
   into itself.

   Tradition always means the need of the present appealing to the
   authority of the past. In this case, however, an additional multitude
   of ideal and historical elements came into play. [64] Moreover the
   conflict with the Gnostics and the Marcionites must have thrust the
   absolute authority of the Twelve Apostles more and more into the
   foreground as against the claim of these opponents to a secret
   tradition, or their preference for one particular Apostle. Where one
   spoke of the Lord or of the Gospel, one might without irreverence add
   the Apostles, even in the case of the Gospels, since these took the
   place of the Word of the Lord. The formula, "The Books and the
   Apostles," is first met with in the so-called Second Epistle of Clement
   (chap. xiv. 2): ouk oiomai humas agnoein hoti ta biblia kai oi
   apostoloi ten ekklesian ou nun einai alla anothen (legousin). [65] If
   ta biblia means the Scriptures of the Old Testament and the Gospels,
   then we have here a formula already very similar to that of the
   Scilitan martyrs ("libri et epistolæ Pauli viri justi," vide infra),
   and the same is the case if ta biblia means only the Gospels. If,
   however, by ta biblia the Old Testament alone is meant, then the
   Gospels and the Apostolus are included in the one term hoi apostoloi,
   and this is the terminology that is also found in the Muratorian
   Fragment (lines 79 f.). But even if the author is supposed to be
   referring here to oral utterances of the Apostles--which is not
   probable because he seems to have a passage of Ephesians in his
   eye--the fact still remains that now "the Apostles" are placed in the
   same close connection with "the Scriptures" as some decades previously
   "the Scriptures" with "the Lord." Actual writings of the Twelve
   Apostles must have been sought for with ever more yearning and longing
   eyes. But were they to be found? One had indeed two Epistles of John,
   an Apocalypse of John, one of Peter, an Epistle of Jude that could be
   regarded as Apostolic (vide Tertullian, De Cultu, i. 3), and perhaps an
   Epistle of Peter. Little, indeed, and moreover of purely individual
   import; and besides we do not know whether these writings were anywhere
   to be found collected together before A.D. 180. What one must have and
   had not was a book in which the acts and the teaching of all the Twelve
   Apostles were described. We can understand that, under these
   circumstances, notice was attracted by the book that, among all
   existing books, approached closest to this ideal--namely the Acts of
   the Apostles. But there is no evidence that this happened before about
   A.D. 175. We must therefore for the moment leave this book out of
   consideration. Thus there remained in fact only the Pauline Epistles:
   they were collected and were in circulation in many of the Churches. No
   doubt when one spoke of the "Apostolus" in the first three-quarters of
   the second century, one had these works especially, perhaps
   exclusively, in one's eye.

   But how far could the Lord be said to continue Himself in St Paul? This
   Apostle was certainly not of the number of the Twelve Apostles! To
   answer this question fully it would be necessary to take a wide outlook
   and to describe the history of the relation of St Paul to the original
   Apostles and the strict Jewish Christians. But it is sufficient to
   point out that the position which St Paul claimed and acquired in the
   Apostolic Age, and authenticated by his work, was one that allowed the
   Churches no vacillation and no compromise in their judgment. Here,
   indeed, it was true that "He that is not with me is against me." One
   was compelled either to acknowledge Paul as an Apostle of equal rank
   with the Twelve or to reject him as an interloper. And yet now--after
   he had long been recognised and after his epistles had increased in
   importance, because they alone gave clear expression to the theory of
   the New Covenant, which more and more gained ground--his equality with
   the Twelve seemed to be again in question; for, seeing that he was not
   an eye-witness of the life of the Lord, he could not testify to the
   facts of His history and His nature. In addition, the confident appeal
   of the Marcionites and Gnostics to the Apostle must have made Churchmen
   nervous. [66] But the custom of public reading of the Pauline Epistles
   was already far too widely spread and the prestige of the "righteous,"
   the "good" Apostle, the "vas electionis" was already too firmly
   established to receive any real shock. Besides, it was possible to
   legitimise Paul by means of the Twelve Apostles as they were
   legitimised by Christ. They had indeed recognised him as an Apostle!
   Such legitimisation was by no means in the sense of St Paul himself;
   but this point was left out of consideration. According to the theory
   of succession, universally accepted at that time, he to whom office was
   delegated was of equal authority with him that conferred the office.
   Thus the equation held good: God = Christ = the Twelve Apostles = Paul.
   But where was to be found documentary evidence of Paul's legitimisation
   by the Twelve? In the Epistle to the Galatians; but that was not
   enough; the chapter in question could even be understood otherwise,
   and, besides, testimony which one gives to oneself is not trustworthy.
   [67] The required testimony stood in the Acts of the Apostles. This
   fact lent the book incomparable value; there was none like it, for,
   without it, the "Apostle" Paul with his epistles, regarded from the
   standpoint of strict tradition, was left in the air; while founded upon
   this book his epistles were "Apostolical" in the strictest sense of the
   word, and he himself stood as near to Christ as did the Twelve.

   (B) We have already passed on to the subject of Attestation. In the
   history of any of the higher religions, of those at least which depend
   upon demonstration and proof, there comes a moment--and that soon--when
   attestation becomes as important as content. If the adherents of a
   "new" religion present its content as identical with that of original
   religion, all that they have to do is simply to disperse the obscurity
   into which original religion has fallen among men. If, then, the new
   religion contains doctrinal statements that are adapted to this
   purpose, it is only necessary to prove their trustworthiness and all is
   accomplished. Such was the method of the Apologists when face to face
   with the heathen: their chief task was to prove the trustworthiness of
   the prophets who accompanied history with a long chain of witness. If
   the demonstration proved irrefutable, the religion was justified. Soon
   the same method came to the front in internal controversies among
   Christians. When once the history of the Kurios Christus, His Divinity
   and Humanity, came to occupy the centre of interest--and this already
   happened in the Apostolic Age--everything depended upon attestation;
   for the content of the message was by no means so strange to the
   heathen. It was not the essence of the message, "the manifested God,"
   that they felt to be "folly," but its accidents, and that the "Mythus"
   was not to be regarded as merely symbolic, but as actual history. All
   attestation of historical facts is carried out by an unbroken chain of
   paradidonai (on the part of those who are authorised) and of
   paralambanesthai. Following up the chain, the Twelve Apostles and no
   others could rank as the ultimate authorities for the tradition! If the
   content of the tradition became a matter of controversy it was
   necessary to find one's way back to them, just as in the case of the
   message concerning God the Creator it was necessary to find one's way
   to Abraham, Noah, and Adam. If it was necessary in the latter case to
   prove that Homer and the other Greeks were "later," and therefore
   without authority, so here one must prove the same of the Gnostic
   teachers together with the supposed Apostolic authorities to which they
   appealed. With this intention, Papias made earnest and exclusive
   inquiry after what the Twelve Apostles had said (apart from the
   Gospels) concerning Christ, [68] and Justin presented the Gospels, even
   to his heathen readers--thus not to Gnostics--as memorabilia of the
   Apostles [69] ; as indeed Papias before him doubtless assigned the
   highest value to this character of the Gospels upon which he based his
   great work concerning Christ. Gospels, there-fore, which bore the name
   of an Apostle or a disciple of the Apostles [70] acquired a new
   attribute: they were not only "Scriptures of the Lord," but also
   "Apostolic Scriptures," and gradually it came to be as important that
   they were the latter as it was that they were the former. If, however,
   the Gospels as Apostolic writings became so important because of their
   attesting power, it follows that every Apostolic writing must have
   become important because it could "give attestation." Accordingly
   Epistles and Apocalypses, if they were Apostolic, appear in a new
   light. Not only their rich and various content and their aim gave them
   a considerable value, but they acquired a yet higher value from their
   origin as Apostolic works. We know that in Rome at the end of the
   second century all the writings of the New Testament were subsumed
   under the one title "Apostoli," just as the Scriptures of the Old
   Testament were simply called "prophetæ" (vide supra the Muratorian
   Fragment) ; indeed that, perhaps, at the time of the Second Epistle of
   Clement, "Apostles" was already the designation for both Epistles and
   Gospels. When, however, this simple distinction between the new and the
   old collection, expressed in the term "Prophetæ-Apostoli," [71] had
   once been worked out and thoroughly settled by the Montanist
   controversy, then first the "Apostolic" shone forth in full glory;
   indeed even the words of the Lord appear now only as jewels in the
   monstrance of the traditio et doctrina apostolica which included
   all--even Gospels with the Kurios--and, in itself, expressed all that
   God after the time of the Old Testament had granted to mankind. The
   division of the new collection into two parts is secondary when
   compared with its unity; but this unity bears on its forefront the
   title "the Apostles," not "the Lord." What a swing round!

   (C) But must not the formal addition of the Pauline Epistles, as they
   stood and as they were read, to the growing new Canon have presented
   continual difficulties? When we consider much of their content we may
   well suppose that this was so. Did they then come into the Canon faute
   de mieux or because, under the dominance of the idea of the Apostolic,
   ever growing in importance, the custom of public reading insensibly
   attached them to the Canon? Neither of these explanations is in my
   opinion sufficient, rather we must again take into account the
   canonical collections of Marcion and the Gnostics. We have already had
   recourse to these in answering the question how a second Canon arose in
   the Church. Now we must inquire whether they were not also of influence
   in the division of this second Canon into two parts and in determining
   the important position that St Paul occupies in it.

   Marcion's Canon was twofold: it comprised the Gospels and ten Pauline
   Epistles. The twofold paradox of the New Testament of the Church that
   it is twofold, and that the Pauline Epistles form so large a part of
   the second division, is thus foreshadowed in Marcion's Canon. But it is
   also foreshadowed in the Valentinian Canon, as we may conclude from
   Ptolemy's letter to Flora. [72] In those heretical circles the
   reverence for St Paul was almost boundless. Origen tells us that
   according to the Marcionites St Paul sat on the right hand of Christ in
   heaven--as Christ sits on the right hand of the Father. Marcionites,
   among whom the Johannine Gospel had partly come into favour, or some
   other heretics, declared that he was the promised Paraclete. [73] It
   was, moreover, Marcion himself that, according to Esnik, taught that
   Christ had twice descended from Heaven; the first time to suffer and to
   die, the second time to call Paul and to reveal first to him the
   significance of His death. [74] The bipartite division of the new Canon
   into "Gospel and Paul" was accordingly for Marcion a matter of course.

   Could this fact have influenced the great Churches? I believe that we
   may well assume that it did. Were the great Churches to lag behind the
   heretics in reverence for St Paul? This would have meant, as things
   lay--i.e. it must be either one thing or the other--the surrender to
   them of Paul. But it appears that we also have external evidence for
   our assumption. We have indeed long known that Marcionite readings
   found their way into the ecclesiastical text of the Pauline Epistles,
   but now for seven years we have known that Churches actually accepted
   the Marcionite prefaces to the Pauline Epistles! De Bruyne has made one
   of the finest discoveries of later days in proving that those prefaces,
   which we read first in Codex Fuldensis and then in numbers of later
   manuscripts, are Marcionite, and that the Churches had not noticed the
   cloven hoof. [75] But this proves only the influence of the text! No,
   it shows the influence of the Marcionite collection of the epistles
   upon the formation of the ecclesiastical collection. Are we then to
   suppose that it had no influence upon the idea of the collection itself
   as set side by side with the Gospels? Surely we may assume that this
   influence upon the formation of the collection goes back to a very
   early period. Does not this lead us back to the time of the origin of
   the ecclesiastical Canon? But, even if we are sceptical in regard to
   this piece of external testimony, it still remains true as we
   previously stated that what was an accomplished fact with the
   Marcionites and the Valentinians could not have remained without
   significance for the Churches.

   There is, besides, another point to be considered. It is true that the
   speculation advanced by the author of the Muratorian Fragment [76]
   --that Paul like John, in that he wrote letters to seven Churches,
   wrote really to one, thus to the universal Church--was certainly first
   imagined at a time when the Epistles had already found their place in
   the Canon, and when it was wished to justify the inclusion there of
   such occasional writings. [77] But the idea, "Apostolus ad omnes
   scripsit dum ad quosdam," [78] is naturally much earlier in date. It
   must have made its appearance wherever men had learned to value the
   edifying power of the Epistles. The "catholicity" of the Epistles was
   clear from many passages that they contained; and even if there had
   been fewer passages whose general ecclesiastical importance was not of
   itself conspicuous and needed no artificial light, yet the Apostolus
   belongs to the Ecclesia and the Ecclesia to the Apostolus! When once
   the concept and title Apostle had been given to St Paul it could only
   be a question of time when his writings, whatever they contained, would
   be formally elevated to the plane of "ecclesiastical" Scripture. That
   herein the real service, which some of his Epistles had always
   contributed and still continued to contribute to the cause of Church
   order, played a certain rôle is shown by the quaint little note of the
   Muratorian Fragment in reference to St Paul's Epistles to particular
   persons: "In ordinatione ecclesiasticæ disciplinæ sanctificatw sunt."

   But St Paul could never be "the Apostolus." He could not give direct
   testimony; and certain objectionable elements, presented by the
   particular and occasional character and peculiarities of his Epistles
   and hindering their formal canonisation, remained a difficulty. [79]
   This is the reason why, only twenty years before Tertullian's famous
   statement concerning the Bible of the Roman Church--and therefore also
   of the African Church--("Ecclesia Romana legem et prophetas cum
   evangelicis et apostolicis litteris miscit; [80] inde potat fidem," De
   Præsc., 36), African Christians, laymen, as it seems, answered the
   question: "Quae sunt res in capsa vestra?" with the words: "Libri et
   epistulæ Pauli viri iusti." We learn that at this time in Africa the
   Epistles of St Paul had a place beside the sacred collection, but that
   the last step, by which they became fully identified with the graphai,
   had not yet been taken. Here we actually see into the process of growth
   of the New Testament, and that directly before its final close. [81]
   The distinction between the "Scriptures" and Paul is still found in the
   controversial work of the Roman Caius (about A.D. 200).

   The Pauline Epistles, because they were widely read, at the very
   beginning came as it were into Court with the claim to be constituents
   of the New Testament that was to be; but it was only after a slow
   process that they won a place beside the Canonical Scriptures, and only
   because of this slow process were they able to obtain and maintain a
   place in the Canon and finally to form its second division. But in this
   second division there also stood, as we learn from Irenæus, the
   Muratorian Fragment and Tertullian--about A.D. 180-200--that is, as
   soon as the Second Canon was in existence--at least 5 (6) other works:
   The Acts of the Apostles, two Johannine epistles, Revelation, the
   Epistle of Jude, and perhaps 1 Peter. [82] Concerning the last five
   works, we may be sure that wherever they were in circulation they would
   at once have been added to the new Canon as apostolic works in the
   strict sense of the word. Search was evidently

   Polycarp, in his epistle, uses this work but does not quote it,
   treating it just as he does 1 Clement, while he deals otherwise with
   the Pauline Epistles. It is wanting in the Muratorian Fragment, and
   Tertullian in his earlier works does not quote it (yet it is different
   with Irenæus). The questions therefore arise whether Peter was regarded
   as the author of the work, and whether it belonged to the most ancient
   form of the Canon. I therefore neglect it. We may, however, assume that
   the Apocalypse of Peter belonged at first to the Canon, but that in
   Rome very soon it was objected to (vide the Muratorian Fragment. More
   will be said below concerning this question and the case of the
   Shepherd of Hermas). made for such writings, which were indeed just the
   kind of works that were needed for the second division of the Canon;
   and, therefore, even a little fugitive piece like the Epistle of Jude
   was accepted seeing that one could regard its author as an Apostle.
   [83] How unfortunate that so few works of the Twelve Apostles could be
   found and then each only giving the testimony of one Apostle! Where
   could a book be found that gave the testimony of all the Apostles and
   reproduced their teaching? The Acts of the Apostles was at once seized
   upon. We have already (p. 53) spoken of this book; we shall now
   consider it in greater detail. It did not, indeed, offer all that could
   be wished in accordance with the idea that governed the development of
   the new Canon, yet what it offered was of extraordinary importance. It
   stood forth as the grand fundamental document of what was primitive and
   apostolic and of the testimony which was now all important. From the
   standpoint of the early Catholic time it possessed the following
   advantages:

   1. It was the work of that Luke who, by his work that stood in the
   Canon of the Gospels, was already recognised as "vir apostolicus" and a
   Canonical author. [84]

   2. It described the early history of the Church in an heroic
   style--i.e. it bore testimony to the classical character of that
   history.

   3. It reported speeches and testimonies of all the Apostles by the
   mouth of St Peter.

   4. It related the missionary activity of at least one, if not two, of
   the primitive Apostles, an activity that could be regarded as the work
   of all the Apostles.

   5. It described the transition from the mission to the Jews to the
   mission to the Gentiles, showing that it was carried out by St Peter
   and by the decision of the Primitive Community.

   6. It legitimised St Paul (in the sense of full Apostolate), both
   himself and the content of his teaching, and it afforded highly
   desirable lines of direction for the interpretation of "difficult"
   passages in the Pauline Epistles according to the communis opinio of
   the Church.

   That the book was seen in the light of these advantages is clearly
   proved by the statements of Irenaeus and Tertullian. With the former,
   St Paul and his Epistles stand simply under the defensive shadow of the
   Acts; their authority in history and in the Canon appears guaranteed
   simply by this book. Nor is it otherwise with Tertullian in passages of
   decisive importance. [85] Irenæus boldly states (iii. 14, 1) that Luke
   was "non solum prosecutor sed et co-operarius apostolorum" (adding
   "maxime autem Pauli" in order to reconcile somewhat his extravagant
   statement with actual history). Further, the author of the Muratorian
   Fragment introduced the work with the audacious title: "Acta omnium
   apostolorum," [86] and Tertullian roundly asserts: "Qui Acta
   Apostolorum non recipiunt nec Spiritus sancti esse possunt." Here we
   see clearly in what high estimation the book stood, what was desired of
   it, and with what determined purpose it was made the most of by
   inserting it between the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles. And yet we
   must recognise that according to the testimony of Tertullian the book
   did not stand in the Canon of the Gnostics, that the Eucratites also
   rejected it, [87] that before the Lime of Irenæus and the Muratorian
   Fragment there is not even a shred of evidence that it was used in
   public lection or had any aspirations in the direction of inclusion in
   the growing Canon; [88] finally, that the book was not of a kind that
   from any point of view would entitle it to be included in a collection
   of authoritative works, under circumstances as they existed between the
   years A.D. 70 and 170. Taking all these points into consideration, we
   must conclude that the placing of this book in the growing Canon shows
   evidence of reflection, of conscious purpose, of a strong hand acting
   with authority; and that by such conscious action the ideal Canon, in
   outline at least, was realised in the form of the bipartite New
   Testament both Apostolic and Catholic.

   The small collection of Apostolic-Catholic epistles took its place in
   the Canon by a process parallel to that of the Acts. In the Canon they
   both serve the same aim; the former, as it were, by their own inborn
   right--yet to a limited extent because they were so few and so short;
   the Acts, however, was thrust into its position, and, rightly
   exploited, could fulfil the aim in a high degree.

   The Acts is in a certain way the key to the understanding of the idea
   of the New Testament of the Church, and has given it the organic
   structure in which it stands before us. By taking its place at the head
   of the "Apostolus" the Acts first made possible the division of the
   Canon into two parts and justified the combination of the Pauline
   Epistles with the Gospels. It is also possible to speak of a threefold
   division, in which the Acts (together with the Catholic Epistles and
   Revelation) formed the central portion.

   The Acts of the Apostles proves that the New Testament is "late," i.e.
   that in its form it belongs to a period not earlier than the end of the
   second century. So far as its constituent works are concerned it is
   earlier, for these for a considerable time had been used in public
   lection (even if not regularly) and the Gospels for decades had held a
   position close to, and of equal prestige with, the Old Testament. Hence
   the transition from the earlier condition of things to the "New
   Testament" was for many Churches scarcely noticeable.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52] According to the delusive canon, which, unfortunately, so many
   scholars of to-day follow in the criticism of the Gospels, that
   passages which can also have sprung from developments of the Apostolic
   and later ages must therefore have so sprung. For example: Jesus speaks
   of future persecutions; such persecutions actually occurred; hence
   these sayings have been constructed ex eventu and do not belong to Him.
   Albert Schweitzer does well to protest strongly against such a method.

   [53] Notice the Jewish horizon of this saying.

   [54] It is not here our business to investigate whether the commission
   to the Twelve to forgive sins, to "bind and loose," is to be traced
   back to Jesus Himself, or whether the story was first conceived at a
   later date. But it is certain that, just as the unhistoric command to
   go forth into all the world (Matt. xxviii. 19) belongs to the tradition
   that had taken form in Palestine, so also the conception of the
   Apostles as being dispensers of forgiving power or of the "Spirit" has
   the same place of origin. The sacramental power assigned to the Twelve,
   and their "knowledge of the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,"
   whencesoever these ideas derived, were certainly of highest importance
   for the supreme veneration in which they were held by the Gentile
   Churches, who set the Twelve so near to the Lord and at last united
   them with Him in the New Testament. There is, however, no doubt that
   these ideas proceeded from Palestine.

   [55] Indeed at an early date the general conception was that the
   mission to the world had been actually completed by the Apostles--for
   the end was near and before it could come the Gospel must have been
   preached everywhere--and that present missions were only an
   aftergleaning.

   [56] 1 Clem. 42.

   [57] This conception must have been the more acceptable to Gentile
   Christians seeing that Christ Himself had not come to them. Legends of
   missions undertaken by Apostles soon came to be invented; none dared to
   invent one for Christ (yet one must remember the Abgar legend).

   [58] Rev. xxi. 14.

   places; inferences from the great work of Irenæus; from the works of
   Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria; Valentinians (Ptolemy).

   [64] He who wishes to know more about these elements must above all
   read Tertullian's treatise, De Præsc. Heret. "Ecclesia," and the
   idealised Apostoli are the central ideas of this treatise, and in them
   Jesus Christ is as it were enshrined. How could one then carry on with
   Gospels only as Holy Scripture! Without the addition of the second part
   to the new Canon there was no authentic document for the Church. "Qui
   acta apostolorum non receperunt," exclaims Tertullian, chap. xxii.,
   "nec spiritus sancti esse possunt, (ut) qui necdum spiritum sanctum
   possunt agnoscere discentibus missum, sed nec ecclesiam se dicant
   defendere, qui quando et quibus incunabulis institutum est hoc corpus
   probare non habent." The Holy Spirit and the Apostles became
   correlative conceptions, with the consequence that the Scriptures of
   the New Testament were indifferently regarded as composed by the Holy
   Spirit or the Apostles.

   [65] (I do not suppose that you are ignorant that the Books and the
   Apostles [say] that the Church is not of this world but from above.)

   [66] Tertullian actually permits himself to speak of St Paul naturally
   ironically as "apostolus hereticorum."

   [67] Tertullian, De Præscrip., 23: "Possum et hic acta apostolorum
   repudiantibus dicere: prius est ut ostendatis quis iste Paulus et quid
   ante apostolum, et quomodo apostolus, quatenus et alias (sell.
   hæretici) ad quæstiones plurimum eo utantur. Neque enim si ipse se
   apostolum de persecutore profitetur, sufficit unicuique examinate
   credenti, quando nec dominus ipse de se testimonium dixerit."

   [68] Euseb., H.E., iii. 39. These inquiries, however, do not appear to
   have been very fruitful, and their results seem to have been of very
   questionable value.

   [69] In many passages. To the Jews he presented the Johannine
   Apocalypse, not as the work of a Christian prophet, but as the work of
   an Apostle of Christ (Dial., 81).

   [70] Tert., De Præsc., 32: "Sicut apostoli non diversa inter se
   docuisserin, ita apostolici non contraria apostolis edidissent";
   Advers. Marc., iv. 2, 5: "Nobis fidem ex apostolis Ioannes et Matthæus
   insinuant, ex apostolicis Lucas et Marcus instaurant, iisdem regulis
   exorsi . . . Marcus quod edidit (evangelium) Petri adfirmetur, cuius
   interpres Marcus. Nam et Lucæ digestum Paulo adscribere solent. Capit
   magistrorum videri quæ discipuli promulgarint."

   [71] In spite of the distinction "Prophetæ-Apostoli," it was still
   assumed that the Apostles had also the prophetic character as an
   addition to the Apostolate; but so far as I know they are never simply
   called "Prophets."

   [72] There is no certain ground for the assumption that the
   Valentinians possessed any other writings in their Canon besides
   Gospels and Pauline Epistles. As for the Acts of the Apostles,
   Tertullian (De Præsc., 22), says that the heretics rejected it.

   [73] Orig., in Lucam Hom., 25 (iii. p. 962b): "Denique in tantam quidem
   dilectionis audaciam proruperunt Marcionitæ, ut nova quædam et inaudita
   super Paulo monstra confingerent. Aiunt enim, hoc quod scriptum est,
   sedere a dextris salvatoris et sinistris de Paulo et de Marcione dici,
   quod Paulus sedet a dextris, Marcion sedet a sinistris. Porro alii
   legentes: Mittam vobis advocatum spiritum veritatis' nolunt intelligere
   tertiam personam a patre et filio, sed apostolum Paulum."

   [74] Esnik (vide my Lehrbuch d. Dogmengeschichte, 14, S. 304): "Then
   the second time Jesus descended in the form of His Godhead to the Lord
   of created things (the Demiurge) and held judgment with him concerning
   His death. . . . Then He left him and caught up Paul and showed him the
   price, and sent him to preach concerning the price for which we were
   bought, and that all that believe in Jesus are bought back from this
   righteous (God) to the good (God)." Thus Paul was the first to reveal
   the secret of redemption, not Jesus Himself.

   Januar., p. 1-16), also Theol. Ztg., 1907, No. 5. Vide the copy of the
   prefaces in our first Appendix.

   [76] And, we may say, countless others after him.

   [77] If St Paul had happened to write to three or ten Churches instead
   of to seven, we may be certain that the Universal Church would have
   been found to have been suggested by the number.

   [78] Tert., Advers. Marc., v. 17.

   [79] As was felt even in the fourth and fifth centuries by the more
   sober theologians of the Antiochean school.

   [80] Cf. De Baptism, 15: "Tam ex domini evangelio quam ex apostoli
   litteris." It has been even conjectured that the bipartite division of
   the Old Testament ("Lex et Prophetae") influenced the similar division
   of the New Testament; but this cannot be proved nor is it even
   probable, seeing that the bipartite division can be fully explained
   otherwise, and that the relation of "Evangelium" and "Apostolus" can be
   compared with that of "Law" and "Prophets" only in one aspect, while in
   others the parallel fails.

   [81] The very peculiar formula of Tertullian: "Instrumenta divinarum
   rerum et sanctorum Christianorum" (De Præsc., 40), seems to give us
   another glimpse into the growth of the new Canon. But we cannot be sure
   what Tertullian means by "instrumenta sanctorum Christianorum."

   [82] 1

   [83] Tertullian expressly gives him the title (De Cultu, i. 3
   "[Scriptura) Enoch apud Judam apostolum testimonium possidet").

   [84] It is true that this is not brought out in the title which was
   given to the book. But Irenæus, the Muratorian Fragment, and Tertullian
   lay emphasis upon this point. Reflection upon the content of the book
   was the more important element in the composition of the title.

   [85] Vide De Præscs., 22, 23; Advers. Marc., i. 20; iv. 2-5; v. 1-3.
   Cf. also the passages quoted above, p. 49, note, p. 53, note.

   [86] Even the title Praxeis ton apostolon in the Canon claims much too
   much.

   [87] Euseb., H.E., iv. 30, 5: me tas Praxeis ton Apostolon
   katadechomenoi.

   [88] We have no knowledge, or as good as no knowledge, of the Acts
   before it makes its appearance in the New Testament.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. Why does the New Testament contain Four Gospels and not One only?

   The original title of the Gospels in the Canon had the following form:

   The Gospel { according to Matthew
                according to Mark.
                according to Luke.
                according to John.

   So run the most ancient authorities (the word Gospel is not repeated).
   Casual reflection tells us that titles so completely similar and at the
   same time so imperfect cannot proceed from the authors themselves. We
   must conclude that these titles, like the title Praxeis ton apostolon,
   have been added at a later date. Thus the original titles have been
   lost or rather have been deleted; for these works must have borne
   titles.

   Yet we can trace these titles back to the middle of the second century.
   This fact and the similarity of their form make it certain that they
   proceed from the person who first brought together these four books and
   bound them in one. Consequently this did not happen (as in the case of
   the Acts) when the twofold New Testament took form, but at an earlier
   date. [89]

   In the Manuscripts the common title for all four Gospels is "The
   Gospel." The compiler did not unintentionally not repeat the word
   "Gospel" in the title to each individual Gospel. They were intended in
   combination to present "The Gospel"; none of them had the right by
   itself to be called "The Gospel." Still less might one speak of the
   Gospel "of Matthew," etc; for the word Evangelium had its own
   self-evident genitive, "Jesu Christi."

   Nor, on the other hand, may we take these titles "according to
   Matthew," etc., as if by them the compiler would imply that these books
   were not composed by Matthew, etc., but were only indirectly dependent
   upon these men. No one in antiquity understood the titles in this way.
   The matter becomes quite clear when we consider the titles of the
   apocryphal Gospels: The Gospel of Peter professes to be written by St
   Peter, for St Peter speaks in the first person, and yet this Gospel
   bears the title: "The Gospel according to Peter." The titles Kata
   Matthaion, etc., mean "The Gospel according to Matthew's own
   description," etc., not "The Gospel according to Matthew's tradition,"
   etc. [90]

   The character and the similarity of the titles shows that the four
   books were intended to be regarded as one work in fourfold
   presentation. Irenæus so conceives it when he speaks of the
   "four-formed" Gospel, [91] and the view finds especially clear
   expression in the Muratorian Fragment, the author of which with
   circumstantiality, but most significantly, writes: "The third book of
   the Gospel according to Luke," "The fourth book of the Gospel according
   to John." The compiler of these four books thus judged them not as
   works important in the first place (or even at all) because of their
   authors, nor even as works each of which by itself fulfilled the object
   which each had in view--for then he would not have given us four of
   them--nor even as "Gospels" (as if there could have been several
   Gospels), but as books which together presented the Gospel. In them was
   contained all that could be known and was to be known about the Gospel.

   This condition of things can be traced back for Asia Minor to the time
   of Irenæus' earliest youth, i.e. to just before the middle of the
   second century. Irenæus has no conception that the written Gospel ever
   existed otherwise than in this form; indeed he ascribes its fourfold
   form to a Divine dispensation which answered to the dispensation of
   Nature, and which was already foreshadowed in the Old Testament. [92]

   Nor is it by pure accident that through the testimony of Irenæus we are
   able to say that in Asia Minor this condition of things existed before
   the middle of the second century; for as I have shown in my
   Chronologie, i. S. 589 ff., 681-701, it is most probable that the
   compilation of our four Gospels took place in Asia Minor, and that from
   thence the euangelion tetramorphon [93] started on its victorious
   course in connection with the anti-Gnostic controversies, and in some
   few decades established itself in most of the provincial Churches.

   We know that long before the middle of the second century, in fact,
   already at the time of John the Presbyter, there was much discussion
   concerning the Four Gospels, which were confronted and compared with
   one another, and that in these discussions John himself played an
   authoritative part. These discussions turned, in the first place, upon
   questions of completeness and the correct order of events in the
   respective Gospels, and also upon questions as to whether the authors
   were eye-witnesses, and whether in their works they had given a duly
   lofty expression to the nature of Christ. [94] As usually happens in
   such controversies, some took up an exclusive standpoint and accepted
   only the Johannine Gospel or, on the other hand, only the Synoptic
   Gospels (or even only one of these?), alleging that the other Gospels
   had no authority, and even attempting to convict them of heresy. The
   result of these discussions and controversies was that neither the
   Synoptics nor "John" were dispensed with, but that they were all set
   together in one compilation in the way that has been above mentioned.
   [95] The compilation was thus evidently a compromise, not between
   Jewish and Gentile Christians--this controversy did not even come into
   consideration--but between usages and conflicting traditions in the
   chief Churches of Asia Minor, especially Ephesus, concerning Gospels to
   be read at public worship, traditions that originated in perhaps Achaia
   (St Luke), in Palestine (St Matthew), in Rome (St Mark), and in Asia
   Minor itself (St John). [96] I would just remark that owing to the
   meeting together of several Gospels in one neighbourhood the Churches
   for a time were led to exercise a kind of historical criticism upon
   them (concerning such points as the completeness, the correctness of
   the order of events, the conception of the Person of Christ); and that,
   accordingly, for a few decades, the Church in Asia Minor adopted an
   attitude towards the Gospels which she never allowed herself to adopt
   in the following centuries.

   The compromise took place under the sign of the Johannine Gospel. Those
   who would have this late book read in the Churches of Asia Minor
   carried their point against the "Alogi"; but as they were not able to
   abolish the earlier tradition in regard to public lection there arose
   the difficulty of a plurality of Gospels. If it had been a question of
   only two Gospels the difficulty would have been great enough, it could
   scarcely have been increased when it was a question of three or four.
   Indeed, we may conjecture that the situation created by the success of
   the fourth Gospel made it possible for all three Synoptics to remain as
   Gospel books of the Church side by side with the Johannine Gospel,
   instead of, perhaps, St Matthew only, or only St Mark and St Luke; and
   for existing usages, apart from that of the Johannine Gospel, to be
   tolerated rather than repressed.

   But at the time that this fourfold work was compiled, did its author
   really mean it to be the last word, or was it to be regarded as only
   provisional? In my Reden und Aufsätzen (ii. S. 239 ff.) I have given
   some reasons for regarding the latter alternative as very probable.
   Jülicher (loc. cit.) is of contrary opinion, and asserts that "there
   was no more need that one should object to four Gospels than to
   thirteen Pauline Epistles, or to parallel accounts of incidents in Old
   Testament history. The differences were not felt, one only rejoiced at
   the confirmation which each new evangelist afforded to the other, and
   in the last resort one had recourse to the obvious theory that the
   later evangelist completed the record of the earlier. Naturally every
   small sect had its one Gospel; just as naturally in the Catholic Church
   spread over three continents different books for a time divided this
   prestige, and then settled down peacefully together."

   In my opinion these remarks of Jülicher do not reflect the feelings and
   circumstances of that period. Is it really true that at that period
   four Gospels must have been just as unobjectionable as thirteen Pauline
   Epistles?--to say nothing of the fact that, as is proved by the
   Muratorian Fragment, even the thirteen Pauline Epistles were not felt
   to be absolutely unobjectionable. It is surely of the essence of an
   authoritative history that it should be one and that its prestige
   should be felt to be in peril if other accounts are set side by side
   with it. [97] Still more if this history was meant to be read regularly
   at public worship, alternative readings from other accounts must have
   led to serious misunderstandings. Jülicher's comparison with "Epistles"
   is surely out of place. It was only the special address of the epistles
   that caused certain difficulties; apart from this there could have been
   as many epistles as there were psalms without causing any trouble.
   Neither is it true that no one took offence at the plurality of Gospels
   or felt the differences in their accounts. Did not the very author of
   the Muratorian Fragment write: "Licet varia singulis evangeliorum
   libris principia doceantur, nihil tamen differt credentium fidei, cum
   uno ac principali spiritu declarata sint in omnibus omnia de
   nativitate, de passione, de resurrectione, etc."? This is said in
   opposition to objections which were founded on the plurality of Gospels
   in itself and on the differences in their accounts, among which
   differences one is emphasised as an especially important example! And
   is not the whole discussion of the question by Irenæus (iii. 11. 9) an
   apology for four Gospels in face of the natural demand for only one? He
   also is compelled to make play with the heni tneumati sunechomenon [98]
   against the tetramorphon [99] (a term which in itself only smooths over
   the actual difficulty)--an argument which could have given little real
   satisfaction; and following upon him and the author of the Muratorian
   Fragment constant attempts were made in the Church to force the
   troublesome plurality into an artificial unity. "The differences were
   not felt," says Jülicher. Surely it is just the contrary: from the two
   different genealogies of Jesus to the accounts of His appearances after
   His Resurrection the differences in the Gospels were most acutely felt,
   and all kinds of attempts were made to harmonise them--think only of
   Julius Africanus for one! Nor can I find scarcely anywhere evidence
   that "one rejoiced at the confirmation that the new evangelist afforded
   to the other." What "confirmation" was needed by an evangelist who had
   the name Matthew or Mark? Moreover, "the obvious theory that the later
   evangelist completed the account of the earlier," described by Jülicher
   as a "last resort," not only contradicted the very idea of a Canonical
   Gospel, but first made its appearance at a comparatively late date, and
   certainly did not give pure joy. Finally, I must dissent from the
   suggestion that "if every small sect had its one Gospel just as
   naturally in the Catholic Church spread over three continents,
   different books for a time divided this prestige and then settled down
   peacefully together." Here the contrast between "small sect" and
   "Catholic Church" seems to be incorrectly drawn: on this point the
   needs of the Catholic Church could not have been other than those of
   the smallest sect. Moreover, all separated Christian communities (not
   only small sects) of which we have knowledge, except those that
   separated themselves from the Catholic Church after the creation of the
   Canon of four Gospels, had only one Gospel: for instance, the Jewish
   Christians in Palestine and Egypt, the early Gentile Christians of
   Egypt, the Marcionite Church throughout the world, the Gnostic Jewish
   Christians, and those Christians of Asia Minor that rejected the
   Synoptic Gospels. The plurality of the Gospels was a peculiarity unique
   in character of which, to judge from the earliest Christian writings
   that quote "the Gospel" or Gospel material (1 Clement, Didache, etc.),
   no one then had the slightest conception.

   We are therefore quite justified in our inquiry whether the concession
   that four Gospels were suitable for public lection, made in Asia Minor
   after stress and controversy, was intended as a final solution of the
   problem. The Marcan Gospel and the collection of sayings (Q), the
   author of which was probably the Apostle St Matthew, were followed by
   our St Luke and St Matthew, which were really "harmonies." In these two
   Gospels the two sources are worked up into single books without any
   regard to the dignity of their authors. Why should not the process have
   been continued to a further stage of unification, and the concession of
   four distinct Gospels have been regarded as only provisional? Even if
   we had no further information the question would not be superfluous;
   for it is suggested by the previous course of Gospel construction. But
   we are not without further information. It is true that the
   supposition, suggested by a series of indications, that so early a
   writer as Justin had recourse to a Gospel harmony in addition to the
   separate Gospels, cannot be regarded as sufficiently probable in spite
   of laborious attempts to prove it; but we know as a fact that Tatian
   composed a harmony of the four Gospels, and that in the East this work
   very soon obtained the widest circulation as "The Gospel." Evidently
   Tatian composed this work not for private purposes but, as the result
   shows, in order to replace "the Gospels of the separated." In these
   last days, von Soden, senior, and others with him, have asserted that
   this work must also have played an important rôle in the very early
   history of the Greco-Latin Churches, seeing that it has had an
   extraordinary influence upon the text of the Gospels in these Churches;
   but one can only say that this hypothesis still lacks confirmation.
   Still so much must be allowed--this book was not intended to be
   confined only to the Syrian Churches, it was meant to serve the Church
   as a whole, and in this intention it was not altogether unsuccessful.
   Again, we hear from St Jerome that Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, also
   composed a Gospel Harmony (about A.D. 180). [100] Unfortunately we have
   no knowledge of its details; still we may conclude that Theophilus,
   like Tatian, felt that the arrangement of four Gospels was something
   that was only provisional.

   What, then, hindered the process of combining the four Gospels into
   one, not only in Asia Minor, but also in the Greco-Latin Churches; so
   that in spite of all the disadvantages of plurality they still remained
   distinct? The answer does not seem difficult. Here also the interest
   was at work that asserted itself so powerfully everywhere in the Church
   soon after the beginning of the second century--the interest in
   testimony (vide supra, pp. 54 ff.). This interest--the interest in the
   Apostolic, in sure and certain tradition--surpassed all other interests
   and triumphed over all objections. To possess records given by such
   persons as Matthew and John must have been more important to the
   Churches in conflict with Gnosticism than any other consideration.
   [101] We already see this in the case of Justin who, when he composed
   his apology, had already written at length against heretics. Naturally
   the Gospels are to him important in the first place because they tell
   of the Lord; yet they are to him almost as important, because they are
   "Memorabilia of the Apostles," and we have every reason to suppose that
   Papias, a somewhat earlier contemporary of Justin, was of the same
   opinion; that with him, too, the apostolic names borne by the Gospels,
   declaring their apostolic origin, formed an instance of highest
   authority in the controversy with heretics concerning trustworthy
   knowledge of the person of Christ and of the evangelic history.
   Interest in testimony to tradition could not now allow the four Gospels
   to be combined into one; for then the names would have been lost, or at
   least left uncertain. Hence all efforts in the direction of a
   Diatessaron had no longer any chance of success; the Church was
   compelled to abide by the "four" and to see their unity, such as it
   was, in the spiritus principalis: The Gospel remained "tetramorphon" in
   the sense of "the separated." [102] In principle the same interest as
   that which led to the formation of the second part of the New Testament
   (the Apostolus), also perpetuated the collection of four Gospels, so
   that it never arrived at literary unity. In the name "Apostoli," which
   the author of the Muratorian Fragment uses for the whole Canon, this
   interest finds sharp expression. Not only in the second division of the
   New Testament, but also in the fact that the Gospel is given in four
   books, we possess a lasting memorial of the Apostolic tradition that
   set itself on a level with the word and history of the Lord. This
   memorial was purchased at great cost, at the cost, indeed, of real
   sacrifice, for into the bargain came all the difficulties that four
   separate records must have created for public lection, for the
   instruction of catechumens, and for exegesis--difficulties which
   certainly at first must have appeared almost insurmountable.

   The question set in the title of this paragraph is then to be answered
   as follows: The New Testament contains four Gospels and not only one,
   because at the beginning of the second century these four Gospels met
   together in Asia Minor (probably in Ephesus), and after controversy and
   conflict peaceably settled down together. From Asia Minor this
   arrangement passed to the other Churches. [103] In the background lay
   the purpose to find some single form in which the Church might present
   what was contained in the four; but this purpose was very soon crossed
   by the perception that the four books as works of Matthew and John, of
   Mark and Luke, acquired in conflict with the false tradition of the
   Gnostics an importance immeasurable and irreplaceable. Therefore these
   apostolic works were allowed to remain separate in spite of all the
   difficulties which were there-by involved; and attempts like that of
   Tatian to bring the four into one--attempts which were in the line of
   previous development--found no acceptance in the Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [89] If it had happened shortly before the year A.D. 200 we may well
   conjecture that care would have been taken that in the titles St Mark
   should appear as the Gospel of Peter, St Luke as the Gospel of Paul.

   [90] There were also gospels called kath' Hebraious and kat'
   Aiguptious. Here kata can only mean "according to the use of" or
   something similar. We do not know the origin of these terms. But it
   seems that they are connected with one another--that in Egypt the
   gospel used by Jewish Christians had the one name and the gospel used
   by Gentile Christians had the other.

   [91] iii. 11. 8.

   [92] iii. 11. 8; iii. 1.

   [93] (Fourfold Gospel.)

   [94] The evidence--all pointing to Asia Minor--is found in Papias,
   Clement of Alexandria, the Muratorian Fragment, Hippolytus--Epiphanius
   (Alogi), and Euseb., H.E., iii. 24.

   [95] This meant, whether it was intended or not, that chief prestige
   was assigned to the fourth Gospel; for this Gospel could, indeed, be
   rejected, but once accepted its superiority was therewith silently
   admitted. With this Gospel--and here I agree with Overbeck in the work
   quoted above--it was a case of "Thou shalt have none other gods but
   me." We may at the same time allow that its author--like the Presbyter
   in regard to Mark--could respect the other Gospels as right worthy
   performances, and could even champion them from this point of view; but
   he certainly did not wish to see them at his aide. (Jülicher Einl.5, S.
   465, says that St John did not mean to replace St Matthew and St Luke.
   Certainly, he had quite different aims in writing his book; but did he
   intend that his book should be placed side by side with those Gospels?
   And may it not be that the purpose to supplant them is not obvious in
   his work because it was assumed as a matter of course?). Again the
   third Gospel also was intended to be the Gospel, and Eusebius (who
   certainly knew Greek!) is surely right when he understands from the
   prologue that St Luke was not satisfied with his predecessors, and so
   not even with St Mark, and regarded their works as rather presumptuous
   (H.E., iii. 24, 15). Further, the formal style of the introduction to
   St Mark shows that the author meant this work to be the story, not one
   among many stories. Finally, both these Gospels, in spite of the high
   claims they make for themselves, do not anywhere show that they were
   intended for public reading; while St Matthew evidently was from the
   first so intended. I have no doubt that the two other Synoptic Gospels
   obtained the rank and dignity of works to be read in the Church, just
   because they were associated with St Matthew (vide my Neue Unters. zur
   Apostelgeschichte, 1911, S. 94).

   [96] Just as we must in this connection completely disregard the
   earlier controversy between Jewish and Gentile Christians, so also we
   must reject the hypothesis that any one, except Marcion, ever noticed
   theological differences between the Synoptic Gospels. A controversy,
   however, certainly existed in Asia Minor between these and the
   Johannine Gospel as to whether they depended upon eye-witnesses, and
   concerning the correctness and theological content of their records.

   [97] The comparison with double accounts in the Old Testament does not
   hold good; for we do not know what difficulties they caused during the
   process of canonisation in the Synagogue. The Church here had no
   choice; she simply had to accept the Canon with its difficulties.

   monumenta dimisit, etc."

   [101] In this sense one also spoke of the Didache tou kuriou dia ton ib

   [102] Lietzmann agrees in this view (Wie wurden die B.B. der N.T.

   [103] As an indication that St Matthew was as yet little known, or
   altogether unknown in Rome at the beginning of the second century, we
   have also a piece of external evidence, though it is not certainly
   altogether clear, vide the note of Eusebius (pseudo-Eusebius) preserved
   in Syriac concerning the star of the Magi (Nestle, "Marginalien u.
   Materialien," S. 72; cf. my Chronologie, ii. S. 126): "In the second
   year of the coming of our Lord, under the consulate of Cæsar and
   Capito, in the month Kanun II., these Magi came from the East and
   worshipped our Lord. And in the year 430 (1st Oct. 118/9), in the reign
   of Hadrian, under the consulate of Severus and Fulgus [Fulvius] (A.D.
   120), during the episcopate of Xystus, bishop of the city of Rome, this
   question arose among people who were acquainted with Holy Scripture,
   and through the efforts of great men in different places this story was
   sought for and found and written in the language of those who cared for
   it."
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. Why has only one Apocalypse been able to keep its place in the New
   Testament? Why not several--or none at all?

   In answering this question [104] we may suitably take the Muratorian
   Fragment as our starting-point. At the close of its positive section
   occurs a paragraph which may be paraphrased as follows:

   "We also accept Apocalypses, but only two, those of John and Peter; yet
   the latter is rejected by a minority among us. The Shepherd of Hermas
   ought not to be spoken of as a part of the Canon either now or at any
   future time; for it was written only lately in our own times in Rome
   under the Bishop Pius, the brother of the author; our Canon can only
   contain apostoli. Neither ought it to be added to the Old Testament, as
   some wish who point to the prophetic character of the work; for this
   Book of the prophets is finally closed. Hence the Shepherd of Hermas
   must be used only for private reading." [105]

   If we closely consider what these words say we cannot doubt that the
   author means that prophetic works (apocalypses) as such do not at all
   belong to the Canon of the Church. His statement is, however, involved,
   because as a matter of fact, which he cannot deny, there is question
   here of three works of prophetic character, two of which he himself
   allows to stand in the Canon. He thus occupies a position intermediate
   between two groups in his own Church, one of which would only allow one
   Apocalypse, while the other would allow three to be read in public. It
   is noteworthy that, though he does not agree with the former group,
   their views do not arouse his displeasure; he only states quite
   objectively their dissent from himself. [106] On the other hand, he
   opposes the claim of the other group and rejects it with restrained and
   yet unmistakably strong feeling. [107] The only conclusion we can draw
   is that the new Canon when it was formed contained three Apocalypses;
   [108] but that very soon afterwards in Rome itself a protest was
   raised, with the result that the third Apocalypse was sacrificed to the
   feelings of a majority while a minority effected the rejection also of
   the second. The protest was concerned with the question whether
   Apocalyptic (prophetic) books had any right to be included in the new
   Canon; and the fact that the Johannine Apocalypse and at first also the
   Petrine Apocalypse were able to gain a place therein was due, not to
   their prophetic, but simply to their Apostolic, character.

   Can we imagine a more striking contrast than that afforded by this
   later stage and the first beginnings of the history of the Canon! Now,
   at first, only three Apocalypses are included, and, finally, all but
   one are excluded, whilst at the beginning the Apocalyptic and prophetic
   works--whether Jewish Messianic writings that had not found a place in
   the Old Testament or new Christian writings--were the only books that
   ranked in authority with the Old Testament. Seeing that the "Word of
   the Lord" had not yet found definite literary form we may, without
   exaggeration, say that in those first days the Apocalypses, in idea
   and, indeed, to a great extent in actual reality, appeared as a second
   Canon, and accordingly formed the nucleus of a New Testament [109] of
   definite character which, however, perished at its birth. The
   Apocalypses of Ezra, Moses, and Enoch are quoted as authoritative in
   post-Apostolic literature from the Epistle of Jude onward: Hermas
   quotes no work except a prophecy of Eldad and Modad (Vis., ii. 3, 4);
   nay, even Paul himself quotes an Apocalypse (Ephes. v. 14), so also the
   authors of the first and second Epistles of Clement (i. 23; ii. 11).
   The author of the Didache (ii. 7. 11) forbids any criticism of the
   utterances of Christian prophets, including naturally written
   prophecies, indeed he compares such criticism to the sin against the
   Holy Ghost. This can only mean that the authority of prophecy is
   absolute and must be accepted unconditionally. The author of the
   Johannine Apocalypse closes his book with the denunciation of fearful
   punishments against anyone who dared to alter his prophecy (xxii. 18
   f.), claiming thus for his utterances supreme authority. Hermas
   requires that his little Apocalypse should be read everywhere in the
   Churches. [110] Justin, in Dialogue 81, describes the Millennium first
   according to Isaiah lxv., then he adds that also "among us" a man named
   John, in a revelation afforded to him, has prophesied of a kingdom of a
   thousand years, with which prophecy Justin combines a saying of the
   Lord. The fact that "among us" the gifts of the prophets still continue
   (c. 82, etc.) is for Justin a decisive proof that "we" are the people
   of God. No doubt about it, a Corpus of Christian prophetic writings was
   well in sight as a new collection of sacred scripture.

   Why, then, is it that such a collection has not come down to us as a
   "New Testament?" Why have the first become last--indeed, not even the
   last--why have they almost all been thrust into the background?

   The answer to this question in its main lines has been already given
   above: the course of development of the inner history of the Church
   during the years A.D. 150-180 thrust the idea of the "Apostolic" into
   the foreground as of sovereign authority, and at the same time with
   ever-increasing emphasis proscribed the idea of the prophetic. The
   Montanist controversy, indeed, brought this process to its close. Had
   this controversy not occurred, the process would not only have lasted
   much longer but it might also have had a somewhat different result. Yet
   on the other hand we must recognise that this controversy was only an
   acute symptom of a development whose necessity lay in the very nature
   of the Church as it consolidated itself. Every religious community as
   it grows into a Church based on tradition must proscribe "prophecy" as
   authoritative. Prophecy may continue to play its part in the life of
   the individual and for the edification of smaller groups, it may even
   preserve an honourable place in the Church itself as an ornament of
   spiritual value, but it can never be of Canonical authority just
   because in Churches based on tradition this function belongs
   exclusively to tradition itself and to the official body that
   administers tradition. These two powers are intimately connected and
   only perform their function in the absence of a rival authority. In the
   Churches, however, tradition had necessarily "the Apostolic" as its
   characteristic. Accordingly, if the development of things demanded that
   the test of the Apostolic must be applied also to written works, then
   it necessarily followed that books of prophecy as such must fall out of
   account unless they could produce some other claim to authority. Their
   authors had gifts personal in character, but possessed, so to say, no
   Missio Canonica.

   According to this fundamental principle almost every prophetic element
   was eliminated when the new Canon was constructed, about the year A.D.
   180, a fact that in itself shows most clearly that the Canon was based
   on a selection. Three Apocalypses were indeed preserved, but the
   explanation, so far as the Johannine and Petrine Apocalypses are
   concerned, is very simple. They counted as apostolic writings and this
   saved them. [111] Their apostolic character made them fit to be
   accepted--and, besides, the Johannine Apocalypse contained seven
   (hortatory) epistles, as the Muratorian Fragment remarks not without
   some special reason; we cannot tell whether the Petrine Apocalypse also
   contained passages of a hortative character. What, however, was it that
   protected the Shepherd of Hermas when the decision was once made that
   prophecy was not to be admitted into the new Canon, but was to be
   confined to the Old Testament? Probably it was at first impossible to
   do away with the book because its prestige was too high; after all,
   theory must always come to a compromise with the force of facts! Then
   again, prophecy occupied only a portion of the book, which otherwise
   consisted of exhortations of all kinds that afforded no difficulties to
   the new Canon. And, lastly, it is quite possible that about the year
   A.D. 180 numbers of people, even in Rome, no longer knew how late the
   book was, indeed confidently ascribed it to the Hermas greeted by St
   Paul in the Epistle to the Romans (xvi. 14), [112] thus investing the
   author with somewhat of an Apostolic character. The fact that the
   Muratorian Fragment so emphatically states the late date of the book
   does seem to imply that this was no longer generally known.

   But must not the breach with ancient tradition involved in the
   rejection of prophecy have been felt in the Churches to he
   revolutionary? This would certainly have been the case if the late
   Jewish and the Christian Apocalypses had ever been read regularly at
   public worship; but, then, no such custom can be proved to have
   existed. It is true, as we have seen, that these works were fairly
   constantly quoted; but we may be sure that the general knowledge of
   these works was confined only to isolated utterances from them. Hence
   the new theory, if it spared the three above-mentioned Apocalypses,
   could creep in without causing any perceptible breach. Indeed we may
   say conversely that the new theory could only have arisen because the
   prevailing practice of public lection had unconsciously prepared the
   way for it.

   It was not until theory began to interfere with this practice that
   conflicts arose. We hear nothing, indeed, of these in connection with
   the Petrine Apocalypse; but here we may assume that its authorship by
   St Peter was called into question at an already early date. Those Roman
   Christians that, according to the testimony of the Muratorian Fragment,
   would not have this book read in the Church, in all probability had
   already denied the Petrine authorship--certainly not on the ground of
   critical investigations, but, as we may well suppose, because the
   Apocalypse contained a long discourse of Jesus with the disciples which
   was not contained in the Gospels, and had a suspicious savour of
   Gnosticism. [113] What is certain is this, that wherever the book
   dropped out of use it was regarded as pseudo-Petrine. It disappeared
   silently and peacefully, reappearing here and there for a moment before
   it sank for ever.

   The Shepherd of Hermas fought hard against his expulsion. Nothing
   substantial could be produced in favour of the book except "custom";
   and the fact that the book disappeared so slowly shows what a powerful
   factor custom was in the whole process. The battle against this
   accepted work started by the author of the Muratorian Fragment on the
   ground of the new Canonical principle, [114] and continued by
   Tertullian on Montanist grounds, lasted pretty well through the first
   half of the third century. It ended, as it could only end, disastrously
   for the Shepherd, and even Origen's affection for the book could not
   save it against the new principle. This principle, not the attacks of
   Tertullian, brought about its destruction; and yet in some Churches
   (especially the Egyptian and Latin) it still had friends for a long
   period, and an attempt was even made to preserve the book for the
   Church by attaching it to the Old Testament. [115]

   But even the Johannine Apocalypse during the third century must face
   the attack of the new principle following upon a preliminary assault by
   the Alogi. The facts of this conflict and their con-sequences are so
   well known that we need not here consider them, and besides they lie
   outside the limits that have been set to our investigation. Yet they
   themselves finally confirm the view which we have taken. If objections
   were raised against the appearance in the Canon of a book so ancient
   and venerable, how great seems the gulf that separates present and
   past, how firm and secure the new principle that prophecy as such does
   not belong to the New Testament! It is true that objection was taken in
   Alexandria and Cæsarea to the Millennianism and much else that appeared
   in the book, but the real motive for rejection was that one would have
   nothing to do with prophetic revelations that altered the impression
   that one had received from the words of Christ and the Apostles. For
   this very reason the Apostolic character of the book began to be
   disputed; for there was no other way to do away with the book. If
   things had gone as Eusebius really wished, we should not to-day have
   had the book in the New Testament, but this conscientious accountant
   could not bring himself to allow his own opinion to override the facts
   as they stood, which he felt it to be his bounden duty to state and
   accept. If Athanasius, in his famous Festal Epistle, had accepted the
   verdict of Dionysius and Eusebius, the book would also have been lost;
   for at that time the West also was ready to accept or reject all that
   the great Bishop of Alexandria prescribed. But Athanasius as a
   Churchman followed in his list the tradition of his Church, which, in
   spite of Dionysius, had held fast to the Johannine Apocalypse. Thus the
   book was finally saved for the New Testament. It was now only a
   question of time how long a few Oriental Churches would continue to
   reject it.

   The answer to the question set at the head of this paragraph runs thus:
   The New Testament does not contain several Apocalypses (prophetical
   books), because, according to the principles which led to its creation
   at the end of the second century, prophecy as such was absolutely
   excluded from its sphere; one Apocalypse, however, was preserved,
   because according to these same principles this one as the work of an
   Apostle could not be absent from the Apostolic Canon.

   [104] It has been already touched upon (pp. 35 f.), but requires more
   detailed discussion.

   [105] Lines 71 ff.: "Apocalypses etiam Johannis et Petri tantum
   recipimus, quam quidam ex nostris legi in ecclesia nolunt. Pastorem
   vero nuperrime temporibus nostris in urbe Roma Hernias conscripsit
   sedente cathedra urbis Romæ ecelesiæ Pio episcopo fratre eius, et ideo

   [106] It is the only case of this kind in the whole list. There is no
   reference to the Petrine apocalypse in Irenæus and Tertullian, unless,
   in the case of the latter, it is to this apocalypse that we must assign
   the quotation from an apocryphal work that occurs in De Resurr., 32:
   "Habes scriptum: Et mandabo piscibus maris et eructabunt ossa quæ sunt
   comesta, et faciam compaginem ad compaginem et os ad os.'" I am sorry
   to say that I have overlooked this quotation in my article on works

   of Cambridge.

   [113] About the year A.D. 200 numerous works recounting discourses of
   Jesus with His disciples (especially after the Resurrection) had
   already come into circulation. The majority of these were heretical and
   gave offence to the orthodox. This must have caused anxious and
   sober-minded men, without demanding of them much critical intelligence,
   to come to the conclusion that all accounts concerning our Lord not
   included in the Gospels were to be rejected, and therefore also the
   books which contained such accounts. The passage in question in the
   Petrine Apocalypse must have struck "Canonists" of the straiter sect as
   very suspicious.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. Was the New Testament created consciously? and how did the
   Churches arrive at one common New Testament?

   The Dialogue of Justin with Trypho affords the strongest testimony that
   in the sixth decade of the second century there was no such thing as a
   New Testament (vide supra, p. 16). The Montanist movement gives the
   same witness (vide supra). A movement of its character could never have
   arisen if a New Testament had then existed. On the other hand, Irenæus,
   about A.D. 185, is a witness for the new collection of sacred books
   though not for the closed and definite form which it first acquired in
   the second period of the Montanist controversy. The Muratorian
   Fragment, about the year A.D. 200, and Tertullian are the first
   witnesses that this character had been acquired. The bipartite
   collection as "Books of the New Covenant" thus came into existence
   between A.D. 160 and 180, the relatively closed and definite form was
   acquired between A.D. 180 and 200. [116]

   The difference between Irenæus, on the one hand, and the Fragment and
   Tertullian in their attitude to this question is by no means slight.
   Speaking strictly, it would be possible for us to say that Irenæus had
   no New Testament before him; the name does not occur in his works, and
   though he ascribes the greatest importance to the number four of the
   Gospels, he is otherwise so unconcerned about the number of the books
   that, with him, the Gospels seem still to stand apart by themselves.
   But on closer observation this impression proves false. With Irenæus
   also the collection has a definite structure: Gospels, Acts of the
   Apostles, Pauline Epistles--while the Acts forms the bridge between
   Gospels and Pauline Epistles legitimising the standing and determining
   the interpretation of the latter. Moreover, the selection of books is
   essentially the same in these three earliest authorities. Thus all that
   is characteristic of the Apostolic-Catholic collection is already given
   for Irenæus, and in contrast with him the Fragment and Tertullian do
   not mark a new stage, but a somewhat wider development on the same
   stage; a development which answered to the development in the general
   history of the Church during the last two decades of the second
   century.

   1. We are dealing with a period when the Holy Scriptures were still
   written on rolls. The fact of a definite structure ("evangelicæ et
   apostolicæ litteræ," the latter opening with the Acts of the Apostles)
   is in itself evidence of the first importance that the New Testament
   from a certain point in its development onwards was a conscious
   creation.

   Critics continue to excuse themselves from boldly facing the
   question--conscious creation or not. Up to a certain point this
   reluctance is intelligible and justifiable. In fact, after the four
   Gospels had once come together in Asia Minor, and after they in their
   fourfold form had won their way into one Church after another, there is
   very much in the development of things leading to the foundation of the
   New Testament that can and ought to be explained from the practice of
   public reading and other causes, without recourse to the hypothesis of
   conscious creation. Even the addition to the Gospels of Apostolic
   Epistles in some form or another is an arrangement that might easily
   have arisen quite independently and in essentially similar fashion in
   different Churches. But the form in which the addition is made under
   the dominating influence of the Acts of the Apostles could not have
   occurred automatically and at the same time in different Churches. I
   here refer to what has been already written on page 67: the placing of
   this book (the Acts) in the growing Canon shows evidence of reflection,
   of conscious purpose, of a strong hand acting with authority; and by
   such conscious action the Canon began to take form as
   Apostolic-Catholic. It cannot have happened otherwise; for the sense of
   purpose expressed in the structure cannot have been unconscious. It is
   not permissible to object that the Acts of the Apostles could not but
   find its way into the Canon and occupy an important position therein
   seeing that its author had already found a place there as an
   evangelist; for the book is not placed next the Lucan Gospel, nor does
   the name of Luke appear in its title. The latter fact is most
   important. The compiler does not trouble to give the name of the
   author, it is of no importance for him ; he gives the book the
   inclusive title, Praxeis apostolon, [117] and seems thereby to suggest
   that we have here a book that gives the genuine testimony of the
   Apostles themselves. Note that the Acts of the Apostles is the only
   book in the New Testament that does not bear in its title the name of
   the author! The book was meant to supply the place of a book which did
   not exist and could not have existed! This valuation of the book, this
   new stamp impressed upon it, did not make themselves, they came about
   because a solid organic Apostolic-Catholic Canon was to be gained
   thereby.

   2. Setting at its highest the measure of uniformity in the different
   Churches that must have resulted from the relatively small number of
   early Christian works and from the practice of public reading, we shall
   still never be able from these causes alone to explain the fact that
   the Acts of the Apostles, thirteen Pauline Epistles, the Epistles of
   Jude, etc., always and exclusively are found together side by side with
   the four Gospels. Why in the world Jude, why two Johannine Epistles,
   why everywhere throughout the Church thirteen Pauline Epistles? Why are
   "Apostolici" admitted to the company of the "Apostoli" and yet are
   limited in the second part of the Canon at first only to Luke and
   Hermas? Was the Epistle of Jude really in such wide circulation that a
   whole multitude of Churches was compelled to admit it into the Canon
   independently of one another? No: apart from the structure the
   selection of works affords still further assurance that here a
   conscious will was in final control.

   3. Then there is the agreement in the titles of the books as far back
   as we can trace them, and here the unanimous testimony of the earliest
   Fathers leads us back to the beginning of the third century. This in
   itself is a further proof of conscious creation. We have already dealt
   with the title Praxeis Apostolon; but other titles come into
   consideration, and the unanimity of the testimony in favour of a fixed
   form of titles is so great that the few exceptions appear
   insignificant. Again it is probable that the titles, the beginnings,
   and the endings of some books have been subjected to correction; if so,
   the fact that these corrections have passed into all manuscripts shows
   that they must belong to the time of the final formation of the Canon
   and thus presuppose an authoritative author. I do not, however, propose
   to discuss this point because it has not yet been investigated
   thoroughly and comprehensively.

   The selection of works, the structure of the collection, and the titles
   of the books assure us that in the New Testament, as it stood at the
   end of the second century, we have before us a compilation that indeed
   grew up naturally out of the history of the Church of the second
   century, but only reached its final form through conscious purpose. Why
   indeed is it that not one of the different, possible Canons mentioned
   above (pp. 8 ff. and Appendix 2) came into being in some one Church
   throughout the world? All goes to prove that the new Canon was a
   conscious production. Where did it arise?

   Certainly not in Africa; for the Church there knew, as we learn from
   Tertullian, that all that it possessed was received from Rome. Just as
   certainly not in Egypt; for the relations of the Egyptian Churches with
   the Churches of the Empire were still very slight at the end of the
   second century. It is therefore most difficult to imagine that a
   creation of the Egyptian Church could have established itself in the
   Church throughout the world, while on the other hand, in spite of the
   slight connection between the Empire and Egypt, developments in the
   Empire could easily have influenced Egypt. Again, we may exclude all
   those provincial Churches that consisted at that time of some few
   scattered communities (a diaspora in the strict sense of the word),
   which means in the West all Churches except Rome. We may neglect also
   the Churches of Syria in the widest sense of the term, including
   Antioch. There remain then only the Churches of the coastal provinces
   of Asia Minor, of Achaia and Macedonia, and the Church of Rome. This
   practically means that only the Churches of Ephesus, Smyrna (perhaps
   also Sardis Pergamum), Corinth, and Rome stand in question.

   Decision between these ancient and important Churches is difficult
   because, as we know, they stood in close communication with one another
   during the second century. Polycarp himself even in extreme old age (at
   the time of the Roman bishop Anicetus) visited Rome. The Montanist
   movement was brought before the forum of the Roman Church, and only
   just escaped recognition by a Roman bishop (Tert., Adv. Prax., 1): in
   this connection Irenæus addresses a letter to Rome ; Dionysius of
   Corinth writes to Rome and to other Churches; we know of two Epistles
   from the Roman to the Corinthian Church, and of many other letters from
   the same Church to Churches of the East. Rome made the difference
   concerning the keeping of Easter a matter of universal concern, and
   demanded that it should be settled simply in accordance with Roman
   custom. Much else might be mentioned that I have collected in my
   Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, 1.^3 S. 480-496, under the title
   "Katholisch und Römisch." History shows that at that time the
   geographical centre of Christendom--the region from the West Coast of
   Asia Minor to Rome--was also the centre of movement in the Church, and
   that in this region every care was taken by means of active intercourse
   both by person and by letter to promote uniformity of development in
   opposition to centrifugal and heretical influences. And history also
   shows that without prejudice to the independence of individual
   Churches, the Roman Church possessed an actual primacy in this region.
   Under the care and with the leading of this community, and inspired by
   its exhortation, the Church developed in this central region of
   Christendom.

   So far, therefore, we may say with certainty that the New Testament
   arose in the central region of the Empire (Ephesus--Rome); that it is a
   production of the leading Churches of that region--Churches that were
   determined upon uniformity of development.

   If, however, we examine more closely the character of this new creation
   and then take a comprehensive view of the Muratorian Fragment, the
   earliest list of works of the New Testament, we may advance a step
   further.

   We cannot determine more exactly than has been already done a
   particular Church where the fundamental idea of the New Testament was
   first conceived and realised--the idea, namely, that the Church
   possessed books that were fundamental documents of a New Covenant in
   the same sense that the books of the Old Testament were fundamental
   documents of the Old Covenant. Certain testimony in favour of Asia
   Minor, both for conception and realisation, is afforded by two Asiatic
   authors--Melito (about A.D. 180), who knows hooks of the Old Covenant
   (therefore also of the New), and an anonymous anti-Montanist (about
   A.D. 192), who presupposes the existence of a group of writings (not
   only gospels) as books of the New Covenant, [118] vide supra, pp. 36
   ff.; while another writer of Asia Minor, Apollonius, only a little
   later testifies to the unique prestige of Apostolic Epistles. On the
   other hand, we have certain evidence that books of the New Testament
   were recognised as such in the Church of Rome at a relatively earlier
   date, because the Church of Africa at the time of Tertullian recognised
   them as such. We do well, therefore, to give no exclusive vote for
   either Asia Minor or Rome. But the fundamental idea of the new
   collection as "books of the New Covenant" does not exhaust its whole
   nature. Though it is true that, wherever this idea was conceived and
   realised, it is in the highest degree probable that the Pauline
   Epistles were also already accepted--for these alone (not the Gospels)
   testified to the "New" as a "New Covenant"--and that probably the Acts
   of the Apostles had already received this name, and with the name a
   certain position of prestige, yet it is the organic structure that
   really makes the definite "New Testament," the closed organic structure
   linked together by the central position of the Acts of the Apostles--a
   structure that is for its part closely bound up with the conception of
   the collection as Apostolic-Catholic, or in other words, as a
   collection of works giving the testimony of the Apostles themselves.

   It is in the highest degree probable that the responsibility for this
   structure rests simply with the Church of Rome. In the first place our
   authorities point to Rome. Among these we must also reckon Irenæus.
   Where he lays stress upon the Apostolic-Catholic standpoint, that is
   upon the standpoint of a firm chain of tradition, we always see that he
   stands under the influence of the Roman Church. [119] Now, it may be
   due to accident that we do not receive the same impression from writers
   in Asia Minor. But here we are faced by the following consideration:
   the three great Apostolic criteria that we find in force at the end of
   the second century--the Apostolic Rule of Faith, the Apostolic Canon of
   Scripture, and the Apostolic office of bishops--form a strict unity.
   They derive from one conception, they are mutually dependent upon one
   another and condition one another, and in their unity are, in my
   opinion, only historically intelligible as the reflection and
   expression of the self-consciousness and ecclesiastical character of
   the leading Church, the Church "founded by Peter and Paul." [120] It is
   not a question of the idea of tradition in general--this idea could
   have come into force everywhere independently--but of the employment of
   the idea as the fundamental authority for absolutely everything
   connected with the Church. Such a practice, always in close connection
   with the names of Peter and Paul, is specifically Roman. If this is
   certain, [121] then it is not likely to be without significance that
   the first testimony to the structure of the new Canon and its strict
   treatment as Apostolic-Catholic comes from Rome. Rather we may declare
   with great probability that the moulding of "the collection of books of
   the New Covenant" into a relatively closed Apostolic-Catholic Canon
   with its characteristic structure is the work of the Roman Church.

   And this is the impression always left upon us as we return to the
   Muratorian Fragment. The beginning of this work is most unfortunately
   lost, and we can therefore only form a conjecture as to the real
   intention of its author. But three points are quite clear: (1) Though
   the author speaks with authority [122] --for he feels that all that the
   Church does or may do in reference to the New Canon is self-evident and
   requires no defence--yet he does still partly defend and justify the
   acceptance or exclusion of books, and his whole procedure is
   intelligible only on the supposition that he is addressing himself to
   outsiders who were in great uncertainty as to what should be included
   in the new collection of sacred writings. To these he proclaims: "This
   is our custom, and this must be the custom everywhere in the Church."
   [123] This naïve identification of what the Church of the author does
   with what is to be done everywhere in the Church is one of the
   characteristic marks of the work. The attitude is exactly the same as
   that of Rome in the Paschal controversy. [124] (2) The
   Apostolic-Catholic standard dominates the Fragment from its opening
   words concerning the Gospels to the polemic of the conclusion which
   associates Montanus with Basilides. (3) Just because this standard
   gives complete security and guarantees in idea a fixed organic form for
   the Canon, the author has no further interest in determining the number
   of the books; rather he leaves it open and gives us to understand that,
   on the basis of the correct standard and in given circumstances, the
   Church, i.e. his Church, could in the future accept other books into
   the Canon.

   Taking all these points into consideration, we can only say: Could the
   Roman Church--for it is this Church that speaks in the person of the
   author --so speak and act if it had been forced to consider other
   Churches because these also had long possessed such a New Testament?
   And conversely, could any Church other than the Roman have given birth
   to such a work as the Fragment? No; the Church from which this work
   proceeds feels herself unfettered and independent in regard to other
   Churches--only from this point of view is the work intelligible. But
   this only means that the Roman Church is defining the New Testament for
   herself in the first place, but therewith also for other Churches. This
   Church, then, had not received this Canon from another Church; she is
   bound by no tradition in regard to other Churches; she has herself
   made, and still continues to make, this collection of books; for the
   Canon is only relatively closed. Nothing in the Muratorian Fragment
   suggests that the idea of a new collection of sacred writings side by
   side with the Old Testament was Roman, or that no New Testament in the
   more general sense of the word previously existed; but the Fragment
   gives clear testimony that this particular Canon is the specific work
   of the Roman Church, which cherishes, guards, and develops it, and now
   also delivers it to other Churches as the Apostolic-Catholic Canon to
   be by them accepted and observed. [125]

   First the collection of four Gospels arose in Asia Minor; then in the
   centre of ecclesiastical development--in the region bounded by Rome and
   the west coast of Asia Minor--a larger collection of "Books of the New
   Covenant" grew up, consisting of the thirteen Pauline Epistles, several
   Catholic Epistles, the Revelation of John (and other Apocalypses), and
   lastly the Acts of the Apostles under this name--this collection sprang
   from the common labour and intercourse of the Churches in the face of
   heresy and Montanism. Finally, the Roman Church gave form to this
   collection by enforcing throughout the principle of the
   Apostolic-Catholic, by placing the Acts directly after the Gospels and
   attaching to it or rather subordinating to it all the other books, and
   by applying to the Apocalypses the strict test of apostolicity to which
   all the Apocalypses save one very soon fell victim. This New Testament,
   clear and intelligible in its structure, and in regard to its content
   differing little from its immediate forerunners, gradually established
   itself in the Churches.

   Clement of Alexandria does not as yet know this final form of the New
   Testament; however, he shows that he is influenced by its forerunner.
   [126] This is not surprising, for Clement was well acquainted with a
   store of tradition emanating from the Churches of Asia Minor, indeed
   these traditions were of fundamental importance for him. If we examine
   his works with a view to constructing the collection of sacred writings
   in use in the Church of Alexandria, we soon discover that this Church
   possessed the Canon of four Gospels, that it read the Pauline Epistles
   as sacred and absolutely authoritative works, but that it also
   recognised a multitude of early Christian writings of various kinds as
   sacred in various degrees. Among these we find the Acts of the Apostles
   and, indeed, under this name. But while it is questionable whether any
   definite collection of sacred writings, standing in any sense on a
   level with the Old Testament and the Gospels, can be spoken of as
   existing in the Church of Alexandria--each work, from the Pauline
   Epistles to the Epistle of Barnabas, stood by itself, each had its own
   individual significance in the sphere of the holy and authoritative--so
   it is still more questionable whether the Acts of the Apostles, not
   infrequently quoted by Clement, belonged to this collection if it
   existed. [127] It is very possible that the actual position of the
   Church of Alexandria in regard to the growing New Testament was yet
   more primitive than it appears in the works of Clement, who by his
   travels and through his connection with numbers of Churches outside
   Egypt was well acquainted with their circumstances. If in one of his
   works he actually commented on 1 Peter, 1 and 2 John, and Jude alone
   among the Catholic Epistles, and when he gives the name Praxeis
   Apostolon to the second work of St Luke, in both cases he is evidently
   dependent upon the New Testament as it was developing in the Empire.
   The Church of Alexandria seems to have indiscriminately accepted every
   work that could be possibly regarded as sacred, and as occasion served
   to have appealed to each as authoritative. Not till the beginning of
   the third century can this Church have arrived at a more definite
   selection and structure for its sacred writings. It is surely
   significant that at this time Origen, the chief of the Catechetical
   School, visited Rome, and there came into touch with the presbyter
   Hippolytus, and that since the beginning of the third century general
   relations between the Church of Alexandria and the Church of the Empire
   became more intimate than before. When, however, the Church of
   Alexandria was confronted with the necessity to form for herself a
   definite New Testament, she found in her midst a greater number of
   works claiming acceptance than were to be found in the more central
   Churches of the Empire. The Alexandrian Church had long ago taken the
   Epistle to the Hebrews into her collection of Pauline Epistles and
   would be reluctant to lose it; again, decision had to be given
   concerning the Epistle of James, a second Epistle of Peter, and a third
   Epistle of John, as well as Barnabas, Clement, Didache, etc. (and
   Hermas again), all of which presented themselves for acceptance. In
   accepting and rejecting this Church now openly followed the same
   principles that were current in Rome, i.e. she accepted only what was
   or seemed to be strictly Apostolic. As a result the New Testament of
   Alexandria was somewhat more comprehensive than the Roman; so also in
   other Churches of the East, as the Roman standard gradually came to be
   accepted and applied to the works that up to this time had been read in
   each Church, the resulting New Testament in each case disclosed
   differences sometimes of a plus, sometimes a minus.

   The disputes of scholars and Churches concerning these differences, the
   efforts of Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius, and others in this connection,
   the final compromise in the second half of the fourth century, the
   differences still remaining especially in the Churches of the extreme
   East--all these questions, however necessary it is that they should be
   discussed, nevertheless involve absolutely no principle of any
   importance, depending as they do upon the operation of a single
   insignificant factor. No one now felt empowered to make any change in
   the compass of the New Testament--the spirit that could soar to the
   heights of the recipimus of the Muratorian Fragment soon died out in
   the Church. Never since the very beginning of the third century do we
   hear of even synods dealing boldly with the question of the canonicity
   of books. All that could be done now was to count the heads of Churches
   and authorities, and the conception of the "Antilegomena" now took
   form--a conception that was essentially impossible and evasive, and
   that simply meant a metabasis eis allo genos. Finally, the New
   Testament, in the form of the more comprehensive Canon of Alexandria,
   gained the victory also in the West, because it was backed up by the
   authority of Athanasius and because his manifesto found the Western
   Churches so situated that they were more disposed to bow before the
   higher antiquity of the Churches of the East than they had ever been
   before. The Canon of twenty-seven books, as we still have it to-day, is
   the Canon of the Alexandrian Church of the third century, but its
   nucleus is the New Testament as it was created about A.D. 200 in Rome.
   [128]

   After the Roman Church had given form to the new collection of sacred
   writings and had in idea created a closed Canon, this creation
   functioned so admirably in every Church where it was accepted as a
   pattern in the course of the third century, that throughout the
   Churches the New Testament was regarded as if it were as fixed and
   definite an entity as the Old Testament, while in truth there was still
   great lack of uniformity. This is an astounding fact, yet so it
   happened. For this very reason we are justified in asserting that the
   Churches arrived at a single New Testament, because in Rome at the end
   of the second century the new collection of sacred writings attached to
   the Gospels was organised and crystallised under the influence of a
   grand and simple conception; because this procedure met with universal
   acceptance on its own merits backed by the authority of the Roman
   Church; and because the different and formless collections of the other
   Churches were so closely related to that of Rome that they could
   accommodate themselves to the Roman conception without great difficulty
   and sacrifice. [129]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [116] The books of the New Testament are now called "Holy Scripture,"
   and are all quoted with the phrase gegraptai like the books of the Old
   Testament; but the influence of earlier custom, according to which the
   writings of the Old Testament alone counted as Holy Scripture, may
   still be traced in authors of the third century, with special strength
   naturally in authors at the beginning of that century.

   [117] I do not believe that the original title was simply Praxeis
   (Tischendorf). Tischendorf here follows his prejudice in favour of
   Codex Sinaiticus, which itself gives Praxeis Apostolon in the
   subscription. The cloud of witnesses from the Fathers proves only that
   the abbreviated title was in constant use, as was only natural. For a
   moment the thought might suggest itself that Praxeis Apostolon was
   intended originally to be an inclusive title for the whole second part
   of the New Testament, and that the Acts had accordingly no separate
   title; but this hypothesis cannot stand. No manuscript of the New
   Testament, so far as I know, has the name of Luke in the title of the
   Acts.

   [118] The remarkable expression of the anti-Montanist--that he fears to
   give an impression that in writing he intended to add something to tes
   tou euangeliou kaines diathekes logo--is so important, first, because
   it shows that the Gospel is the ruling factor, and secondly, because it
   is intelligible only if we suppose that the author pictures the logos
   tes kaines diathekes in writings, and that these writings consisted not
   only of gospels. For if the collection only included gospels, we cannot
   understand why the author should have feared being suspected of
   intending to add to the collection by writing his book. Moreover, there
   is some probability that the author reckoned the Apocalypse of John in
   the collection, for the words which he uses in this connection (to logo
   tes kaines diathekes mete prostheinai mete aphelein dunaton) are
   probably not independent of Rev. xxii. 18 f.

   [119] His other authority, "all the presbyters in Asia who saw John,"
   is subsidiary, belongs to Asia Minor, is derived from Papias, and has
   force only in special cases.

   [120] This self-consciousness and this character, already so clearly
   shown in 1 Clement, were, indeed, thankfully and admiringly recognised
   by non-Roman Christians of the second and of the beginning of the third
   centuries. I would recall only Ignatius (Preface to the letter to
   Rome), Irenæus, and Tertullian.

   [121] The great majority of the other Churches--of all we may well
   say--towards the end of the second century simply did not possess a
   fixed, as it were standardised, Rule of Faith such as the Roman Church
   possessed in her Symbol; this at least is what we learn from
   investigations that have been made into the history of the Symbol and
   the Rule of Faith. Such Churches could naturally compile collections of
   sacred writings, but not the New Testament.

   [122] For this very reason he must either have been the bishop, or must
   have written in close understanding with, or under the direction of the
   bishop. The Fragment derives from Victor or (less probably) from
   Zephyrinus, or from a Roman cleric writing in accordance with their
   views.

   [123] He only leaves choice free in the case of the Petrine Apocalypse.

   [124] "We," i.e. the Roman Church, and the "Catholic Church," are
   interchangeable. The subject in "a nobis" (line 47), "recipimus" (lines
   72 and 82), in "ex nostris" (lines 72 f.), is surely the Church to
   which the author belongs and not an ideal subject; but this "we accept"
   is equated with "in catholica habentur," etc.

   [125] We still trace in the Fragment something of the idea that the
   Roman Church regarded the Canon as their own, and at the same time as
   Catholic.

   [126] Vide my Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, 1.4 S. 390-394.

   [127] Leipoldt, Geschichte des Neutestamentlichen Kanons, 1. S. 200;
   "Clement does not regard the Acts of the Apostles as canonical."

   [128] Indeed, the Homologoumena and the Antilegomena meliores notæ) of
   Eusebius taken together are simply the Alexandrian collection as it was
   formed at the time of Origen and probably under his influence. Eusebius
   in his statements concerning the Canon simply follows the lead of
   Origen.

   [129] The best example of a collection of Christian books still
   unaffected by the final, namely the Roman, arrangement is contained in
   the list called "Catalogus Claromontanus" (Zahn, Neutestamentliche
   Kanonsgeschichte, II. S. 157 ff.): The Four Gospels, the Pauline
   Epistles, two Epistles of Peter, James, Barnabas, Revelation of John,
   the Acts of the Apostles, Hermas, Acta Pauli, Apocalypse of Peter.
   Notice the still subordinate position of the Acts (with Hermas and Acta
   Pauli) between the two apostolic apocalypses. This position shows that
   here the influence of the Roman New Testament had not yet made itself
   felt. The text probably points to Alexandria or to a Church whose
   collection of sacred books was nearly allied to that of Alexandria.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] These two epistles have the testimony of the Murat. Fragment and of
   the Corpus Cypr. (In Tert., De Pudic., "in primore" is to be read in
   place of "in priore epistola [Joannis)").

   [3] The three bracketed works have a special history. In regard to 1
   Peter it is not quite certain whether it belongs to the earliest form
   of the New Testament. The two Apocalypses may indeed be assigned to the
   most ancient form, but they were objected to at once, and this in the
   community of Rome, which, as we shall show, was probably the very
   birthplace of the New Testament. The opposition to the Revelation of
   Peter was at first the weaker of the two, but it very soon and
   completely attained it object, while in the case of the Shepherd of
   Hermas it was strong from the beginning but did not find complete
   success until later. In the earliest (Roman) list of Canonical
   Scriptures which we possess, mention is also made of a "Wisdom" of
   Solomon which we are told was composed by Christian admirers of
   Solomon. Probably "Jesus Sirach" is meant, which was also called
   "Ecclesiasticus." We have here a singular phenomenon which we cannot
   quite comprehend. From the standpoint of the close of the second
   century no special importance need be assigned to the order of the
   Gospels nor to the position of the Catholic Epistles (Philastr., 88:
   "Septem epistulæ Actibus Apostolorum conjunctæ sunt") which could also
   be placed before the Pauline Epistles. Only the precedence of the
   Gospels before all the rest of the writings and the placing of the Acts
   of the Apostles at the head of the second division in idea and soon in
   actual practice (Murat. Fragment, see also Irenæus and Tertullian) are
   firmly established. But it would be a mistake to imagine that at the
   end of the second century absolutely no interest was taken in the
   question of the number and order of canonical writings. The contrary is
   proved by the petition of the brother Onesimus to Melito, Bishop of
   Sardis, that he would give him information concerning the number and
   order of the books of the Old Testament. Melito responded to this
   request, and by a method of counting of his own set the number at
   twenty-one (Euseb., H.E., iv. 26, 13).

II

  The Consequences of the Creation of the New Testament

   From the very moment that the New Testament lay before the Church in
   the form and in the relatively final arrangement attested by the
   Muratorian Fragment and Tertullian (i.e. the Roman Church) it developed
   practically all the consequences and exercised all the influence that
   as instrumentum divinum it could develop and exercise. Its authority
   was as fully recognised as if only one and the same New Testament stood
   beside the Old Testament. All the long-drawn developments, starting
   with the beginning of the third century, that were necessary for the
   production of a really uniform Canon (of twenty-seven books) had
   practically no significance for its prestige, which was already
   perfect, or for its consequent effects, which were immediate. The
   thorough investigation of these extraordinary effects is a task that
   ought to have been carried out by historical science, but it has been
   hitherto neglected. I shall endeavour in the following pages to do
   justice to the task. [130]
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The New Testament immediately emancipated itself from the
   conditions of its origin, and claimed to be regarded as simply a gift
   of the Holy Spirit. It held an independent position side by side with
   the Rule of Faith; it at once began to influence the development of
   doctrine, and it became in principle the final court of appeal for the
   Christian life.

   Any collective body of fundamental sacred documents, as soon as it has
   taken form, stands at once on its own rights. Whatever the
   circumstances may have been under which it came into existence, however
   numerous the forces that contributed to its appearance, however slow
   and difficult the process of its development--from the moment of its
   birth all is forgotten. This is true also of the New Testament. As soon
   as it appeared in its Roman form it was practically regarded as a book
   that had fallen from Heaven: the Holy Spirit had created it and given
   it to the Church, Lessing (vide supra, p. 19, note 1) was certainly
   right when he showed that the Rule of Faith is older than the New
   Testament and had an important part in its creation; but he did not see
   that, when the New Testament had once come into existence, it
   immediately renounced its earthly origin and claimed for itself not
   only a position of equal rank with the Rule of Faith, but in a certain
   aspect even of superior rank. The daughter at once outgrew the mother,
   indeed, politely disowned her and set herself in the mother's place.
   Complicated and energetic measures had then to be taken--the Catholic
   Churches invented them and set them in motion--to uphold the authority
   of the mother as against the daughter, and even then all that could be
   accomplished was either that the mother and daughter should divide the
   leadership between them in so far as they chose different provinces
   (the one rather doctrine the other life), or that they should take the
   lead alternately (vide infra).

   The Apostolic Tradition of Doctrine and the New Testament.--The curve
   of movement of doctrine and life in the Church since the beginning of
   the third century became an ellipse with two foci that at one time
   approached so closely to one another as to seem one, at another time
   were quite widely separated. While the Apostolic doctrinal Tradition
   prevented ecclesiastical Christianity from becoming a religion of the
   book like Islam, the New Testament prevented the "Apostolic Traditions
   of the Fathers" from becoming the tyrants of the Church, as in later
   Judaism. The tension between the Apostolic Tradition and the sacred
   letter of the New Testament proved in the main beneficial to the
   development of the Church; extremes threatening from the right and the
   left were thus warded off. No one has yet written the history of the
   tension and conflict between the spirit and letter of the Bible on one
   side and the Rule of Faith on the other before the Reformation. It is
   true that the New Testament itself in principle and construction was in
   fact "Apostolic Tradition"; yet not only did it very soon represent an
   earlier tradition as opposed to a later continually developing
   tradition, but the independent force of its letter and spirit made
   itself felt more and more--whether to the advantage or disadvantage of
   development. No one dared to oppose the authority of the Divine Book;
   no one any more thought of it as tradition. The learned investigations
   concerning the origin of particular books conducted by a few
   theologians, from Origen onwards, had simply "antiquarian"
   significance. The authors themselves scarcely dreamed of making
   deductions that would affect the dignity of the Book in question. If
   they did, the Church either took no notice or marked down such scholars
   as suspect. The attitude of Tertullian and of his lax opponents in
   Carthage and Rome, who were in absolute agreement with him in the
   valuation of the New Testament and in the principles of its use, proves
   that since the beginning of the third century the New Testament stood
   as apator ametor in the Church. No one any longer thought of a time
   when there was as yet no New Testament; scarcely anyone recollected
   that the Church had created it. Indeed, solemn eulogies of the New
   Testament as the book of the Holy Spirit were fairly frequently
   expressed in terms which implied an exclusive relationship between the
   Holy Spirit and the Book in regard to the Church: all that the Spirit
   had to say to the Churches He had put into this Book.

   The New Testament joins the Rule of Faith in influencing the
   development of doctrine from the moment that it was fixed in idea.
   Already in the Adoptianist and Modalistic controversies passages from
   the New Testament were used as weapons by both sides. In such
   controversies in the Early Church the influence of the Book was not,
   however, altogether progressive; much more often it was a hindrance
   because of the strenuous opposition that it at first offered to almost
   every unbiblical formula that Dogmatics declared to be necessary. How
   difficult it was for "Homoousios" to gain acceptance because it was
   unbiblical! And, on the other hand, how hard for the orthodox was the
   fight against a biblical formula if from higher interests they felt
   compelled to reject it! The battles of orthodoxy against ektisen, [131]
   as used of the Sophia (the Logos), and against the formula prototokos
   pases ktiseos, [132] tell us something of these things. And yet
   isolated biblical phrases found their way into Dogmatics; and more than
   this, Christological passages like that in Philippians ii. have
   exercised the deepest influence upon doctrine. Indeed, speaking
   generally, we may say that though the New Testament did not play the
   principal part in the battle against heresy, it nevertheless formed the
   court of final appeal in controversies concerning the Rule of Faith,
   and never submitted to any tradition, however ancient, that might be
   opposed to it. Again, whole bodies of doctrine of lesser or greater
   importance have found their way into Dogmatics simply because they were
   biblical: the West would never have accepted Augustine's doctrine of
   Predestination if it had not had such strong support in Romans ix.-xi.
   This is, indeed, a particularly famous example, and it would be
   difficult to find another quite like it; but many less important
   instances could be adduced.

   In matters of Christian life the New Testament at once takes a place of
   central and ultimate authority. Here there was no need to change the
   ancient formula politeuesthai kata to euangelion [133] either in letter
   or spirit. We do not here inquire how far this inviolable principle of
   Christian life, to which even the Rule of Faith was scarcely allowed to
   dictate, was actually realised. It is enough to know that in theory no
   one dared to disturb the principle that a Christian was to live in
   accordance with the Gospel or kata ten kainen diatheken [134] and must
   be able to appeal to passages of Scripture as an authority for his
   manner of life. We only notice how soon this led to the rise of
   Monasticism, and later to other strictly regulated forms of life. On
   the other hand, the "Lax" also sought justification for their
   principles and rules in passages from the New Testament. Here very
   abundant and interesting material is afforded in Tertullian's
   treatises. It is the Lax in conflict with a tradition of the Church who
   ask for the passage of Scripture upon which it is founded. "Ubi
   scriptum est ne coronemur? . . . expostulant scripturæ patrocinium"
   (scil. for the prohibition against the wearing of garlands).

   Lastly, in the first days of the Church reading for private edification
   was confined to the Psalms, but after the creation of the New Testament
   the Gospels also gradually came into use--indeed, even the Pauline
   Epistles. Without the New Testament this would never have happened.
   What it meant for the deepening of Christian life and thought, that
   these were nourished on the New Testament and not on the Psalms alone,
   there is no need to explain.

   § 2. The New Testament has added to the Revelation in history a second
   written proclamation of this Revelation, and has given it a position of
   superior authority.

   In Judaism--not only in the more cultured Judaism of Alexandria--one
   had long been accustomed to see the Revelation of God to His people in
   a double form: God has revealed Himself in a long chain of facts,
   institutions, persons, etc., and He has deposited the content of this
   Revelation in a book and has thus embodied it permanently for men in
   written letters. In course of time the book itself became Revelation,
   indeed the Revelation--the double form seemed superfluous--and there
   arose a kind of quid pro quo in that, since the book became Revelation,
   Revelation itself was regarded as consisting of accounts of events,
   doctrines, laws, ideas, and so forth. All that happened, happened only
   that it might be taken up into the book, and that in the book and
   working from the book it might first effect that for which it was
   intended. No longer was it a question of Moses, but of the Law; no
   longer of David, but of the stories about him, and of the Psalms.

   Scarcely was the New Testament created when here also the same idea
   makes its appearance: the book takes its place beside the facts for
   which it vouches, indeed it transforms all facts into words, into
   doctrine. It represents the Revelation of God as a literary revelation,
   and sometimes it seems as if the revelation in facts of history
   required this literary revelation at least as a complement, sometimes
   it seems even to disappear entirely behind the written revelation. The
   text, "What was written was written for our learning," was understood
   almost as if it meant, "What happened for our learning must be
   written." But the idea is carried still further as we see already in
   the writings of Origen. God the Creator has brought into existence two
   great Creations, no more and no less, in which He reveals Himself: the
   Universe and the Bible (i.e. the Old Testament and the New Testament).
   The Bible is the parallel to the Universe; over both the Holy Spirit
   brooded and brought them into existence. Both consist of pneumatic,
   psychic, and material elements. Side by side with the Kosmos stands the
   Bible. While the one is the outcome of Divine thoughts the other is the
   Divine system of thought itself. Thus the Christian Revelation acquired
   a quite different, or rather a "higher" nature; it became a complex of
   ideas, or, rather, it is proved to be in fact a complex of ideas,
   because the Revelation is given as a revelation in writing. From this
   point of view the Christian religion became a religion of a book,
   namely of the Book of Divine Ideas. Then it necessarily followed that
   the Revelation in historic fact, including the historic Christ, of
   which the Book gives the narrative, must fall into the background when
   compared with the Revelation in writing and must become something
   symbolic. It is merely "Mythus," while in the Book the "Logos" bears
   sway. Hence what really matters about Christ is not that as Christ He
   had an earthly history, but that as the Logos of the written record He
   reveals eternal truth. But even where things did not go so far, indeed
   even where speculative theories were rejected, the position adopted in
   spite of all "Realism" was not so very different. Even here "It is
   written" expressed the true authoritative Revelation, and the
   Revelation through historic fact was to be found only in
   Scripture--nowhere else. All that was revealed must be in accordance
   with Scripture. Scripture is the fundamental document of doctrine, and
   scarcely anyone felt an impulse to search for the history that lay
   behind it. The Revelation upon which Religion and Church were founded
   is a written thing. When the formula, "The Scriptures and the Lord,"
   still ran, "the Lord" was still something living; when the formula
   became, "The Scriptures and the Gospel," He had lost something of this
   attribute of life; when it then became, "The Scriptures and the
   Gospels," the attribute of life had become already strictly limited in
   favour of the letter; when finally it came to the formula, "The
   Scriptures of the Old and New Testament," then the Revelation in
   history was practically transformed into a revelation in writing. Thus
   the whole idea of Religion was altered and was fixed in the direction
   in which, up to this time, it had been developing. Because the Bible of
   the two Testaments contained an enormous wealth of material of every
   possible variety, all this belonged to Religion, indeed was Religion.
   Religion is just as much knowledge concerning what happened on the
   second day of Creation as it is knowledge of the loving-kindness of
   God, of the journeys of the Apostle Paul as of the Coming of the
   Saviour. The content of the teaching and letter of the two Testaments
   is the content of Religion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. The New Testament definitely protected the Old Testament as a book
   of the Church, but thrust it into a subordinate position and thus
   introduced a wholesome complication into the conception of the Canon of
   Scripture.

   So long as the Church had no New Testament the Old Testament was always
   in danger so far as its recognition by the Church as an authoritative
   book was concerned, indeed was in peril of life in the Church. Almost
   all "heretics" of the second century rejected it, and this of itself
   shows how difficult it was for many Gentile Christians to sympathise
   with it. On the other hand, so long as the Old Testament dominated the
   Church as the sole litera scripta the danger was always present that
   the Christian Religion would not shake itself free of the shell of
   Judaism, or, in other words, would not be able to give forceful
   expression to that in itself which transcended Judaism. Once, however,
   the New Testament was there, both dangers were exorcised with one
   stroke. The ancient conception of "the New Covenant" carried over into
   a canon of "the books of the New Covenant" had simultaneous effect to
   the right and the left, and definitely removed the chief difficulties
   in either direction. Henceforth Jewish Christians became heretics
   because they had no New Testament--Irenæus already includes them in his
   catalogue of heretics--and the chief weapon of the heretics in their
   conflict with the Church and the Old Testament, the weapon which they
   possessed in their collections of Christian books, was now snatched
   from their hand.

   Though the books of the New Testament were now established as a second
   Canon side by side with the Old Testament, it was impossible that this
   arrangement should produce equality of rank in the two Canons. The new
   Covenant, indeed, would have been quite superfluous if the old Covenant
   had been perfect; accordingly the new Canon would also have been quite
   superfluous if the Scriptures of the Old Testament had been sufficient.
   The new Canon by being attached to the old Canon acquired all the lofty
   predicates and attributes as well as the whole apparatus of
   interpretation of the old Bible, and equipped with these extraordinary
   advantages at once thrust the old Canon into an inferior position.
   [135] In Justin there is as yet no trace of such subordination, for at
   his time there was no New Testament; but thirty years after-wards in
   Ireæeus it is obvious: "The books of the Old Testament are the books of
   the legisdatio in servitutem, the books of the New Testament are the
   books of the legisdatio in libertatem" (vide supra, p. 40). The former
   books belong to the childhood of mankind. This idea is developed by
   Tertullian, and comes to complete and most powerful expression in his
   remarks on the text: "The Law and the Prophets were until John." At
   last St Paul's fundamental conception could come to its own in the
   Church, whereas earlier it seemed to lead into the abysses of
   Gnosticism: the Law is abolished through fulfilment, it is "demutatum
   et suppletum." Now it could be without danger declared that the
   Apostles stand on a higher plane than the Prophets of the Old
   Testament--Novatian has expressed this thought most powerfully. [136]
   The Christian can live from the New Testament alone, but not from the
   Old Testament alone.

   This position, however, involved a multitude of paradoxes; for the
   Christian must henceforth regard the Old Testament at one and the same
   time in the following four ways: (1) The Book is the work of the Holy
   Spirit, and as such of absolute authority; (2) The Book is in every
   line of it the book of prophecy, and is so far limited in that it does
   not contain the fulfilment; (3) the Book is the fundamental document of
   the legisdatio in servitutem, and as such is transcended and antiquated
   by the New Testament; (4) the Book is in every line full of mystic
   symbols of the truth, and these are present even in those passages
   which because they contain ceremonial ordinances are abolished. The
   inevitable result was that the different parts of the book were divided
   under these points of view though without any recognised principle of
   division. The story of Creation in six days for instance, as told in
   Genesis, was always regarded in the Church as a record of absolute and
   most glorious truth that had been in no sense altered or added to by
   the New Testament. Much else in the Old Testament remained for the
   Church on the very highest level of authority. Other parts, however,
   were subject to a more depreciatory or a doubtful verdict. Slowly, and
   yet from the very first, the New Testament thrust the Old Testament
   into the background, and even in the public services of the Church
   claimed and obtained precedence. The juxtaposition of the Old Testament
   and New Testament gave rise to investigations concerning the nature of
   Christianity of which otherwise no one would have thought, and taught a
   better understanding of the nature of the new religion, as we see at
   once when we compare the expositions of the early Catholic Fathers with
   those of the Apologists. how superior are Irenæus and Tertullian to
   Justin in their knowledge of the nature of Christianity! How far
   superior is Clement of Alexandria! And even if the advance noticeable
   in the works of Clement is in great part due to his philosophy, still
   he also owes much to the four Gospels and, above all, to the Pauline
   Epistles. Lastly, the fact that the Canon of Scripture contained in the
   Old Testament something that was "relative" was of great importance.
   The numbing influence of Biblicism, otherwise inevitable, was thus
   warded off. That the Christian religion did not become a religion of
   "the book" in the full sense of the word is due, next to the fact that
   the "Rule of Faith" had authority side by side with the Bible, to the
   fact that in the Bible itself there was this tension between the Old
   Testament and New Testament. The inconsistency and inconvenience of
   having in the sacred Oracles of God elements of graduated, indeed
   sometimes antiquated, value were undoubtedly fraught with good. The New
   Testament has secured the continuance of the Old Testament in the
   Church, and at the same time has guarded against the stunting effect of
   its Judaism, just because the Old Testament was thrust into an inferior
   position by the New Testament. Moreover, the way to the historical
   treatment of the two Testaments was thus left open for future ages.
   Tentative beginnings of such treatment already manifest themselves in
   Irenæus and Clement, who here follow St Paul. But they would not have
   been able to follow St Paul if collections of epistles of the Apostle
   had not been already in existence, equipped with an authority to which
   they could appeal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [135] The circumstances here are similar to those of the relation of
   the New Testament to the Rule of Faith from the moment that the New
   Testament came into existence: just as in this case the daughter at
   once emancipated herself from the mother, stood on her own right, and
   in many aspects even thrust the mother into a subordinate position
   (vide supra chap. ii. § 1); so also the New Testament at once thrust
   the Old Testament into a subordinate position after it had received all
   the latter's predicates of dignity. And yet the unity of the Old
   Testament and New Testament guaranteed by the same Spirit still abides.
   Thus Tertullian (De Orat., 22) expressly states: "Nec mirum si
   apostolus eodem utique spiritu actus, quo cum omnis scriptura divina
   tum et genesis digesta est, eadem voce usus est"; cf. Scorp., 2: "Lex
   radix evangeliorum.

   [136] Novat., De Trin., 29: "Unus ergo et idem spiritus qui in
   prophetis et apostolis, nisi quoniam ibi ad momentum, hic semper,
   ceterum ibi non ut semper in illis inesset, hic ut in illis semper
   maneret, et ibi mediocriter distributus, hic totus effusus, ibi parce
   datus, hic large commodatus." The writers of the Old Testament thus
   possessed the Holy Spirit "non semper sed ad momentum, mediocriter et
   parce," while the writers of the New Testament, like Christ Himself,
   possess the Holy Spirit "semper, totum effusum et large commodatum."
   Here a most important difference is set up, which naturally was not
   followed out into all its consequences. Here, too, Tertullian is the
   forerunner, vide De Exhort., 4: "Spiritum quidem dei etiam fideles
   habent sed non omnes fideles apostoli . . . proprie apostoli spiritum
   sanctum habent qui plene habent in operibus prophetiæ et efficacia
   virtutum documentisque linguarum, non ex parte, quod ceteri" (thus also
   the Prophets of the Old Testament), of. De Pudic., 21.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. The New Testament has preserved for us the most valuable portion
   of primitive Christian literature; yet at the same time it delivered
   the rest of the earliest works to oblivion, and has limited the
   transmission of later works.

   The first clause of the heading of this paragraph requires no proof. It
   is by no means certain that the Pauline Epistles would have been handed
   down to us if as a collection they had not been canonised. The author
   of the Second Epistle of Peter and Irenæus complain of the difficulties
   which they contain, indeed they presented a thousand stumbling-blocks
   to the orthodox teacher, and were exploited in a most irritating way by
   heretics in opposition to the doctrine of the Church. [137] Nor was it
   otherwise with the Johannine Apocalypse: the Canon alone has preserved
   it from oblivion. Both in form and content it presented most
   troublesome stumbling-blocks to the Church, more troublesome indeed as
   time went on. And further, can we be sure that the Acts of the
   Apostles, from the historical point of view the most valuable work of
   primitive times--to say nothing of works so small as the Catholic
   Epistles--would have come down to us if it had not found its way into
   the new Canon? Even in the third century the Christology of this book
   would have given grave offence if the fact that the book was Canonical
   had not barred for ever the question whether it was everywhere
   orthodox. And what of the Gospels? If it had been possible in the third
   and fourth centuries to cite them before the Court of the Church, how
   sadly they would have fared! Even against the Gospel of St John an
   orthodox judge would have been compelled to admit a heavy catalogue of
   offences! The Canon, however, settled these questions once and for all.
   There can be no doubt here: we have to thank the New Testament that we
   possess these works, that we have in our hands an important and
   trustworthy account of the beginnings of the Christian religion. We
   need only reflect for a moment what our knowledge of the beginnings of
   Christianity would have been if the Church History of Eusebius had been
   our sole authority--leaving out of account what this work owes to the
   New Testament--in order to see clearly what it means that twenty-seven
   early Christian writings have been preserved for us because they were
   bound together in the New Testament. [138]

   But, on the other hand, with the creation of the New Testament begins
   the death struggle of that portion of Early Christian literature that
   had not found acceptance in the Canon. I have dealt with the story at
   length in the Introduction to the first volume of my Altchristliche
   Lit.-Geschichte. [139] It is not a question of the loss of early
   heretical works--the New Testament scarcely had anything to do with
   this--but of the loss of early orthodox works. Such works, which were
   originally to be found in the more extensive sacred collections of some
   provincial Churches, especially the Alexandrian, must now yield to the
   stern Roman Law of the Canon, and were for the most part separated away
   and delivered to death under the reproach that they were interlopers,
   that their very existence was a piece of insolence, that they were
   forgeries, and so forth. As a matter of fact they looked like rivals of
   the works of the New Testament, and must be treated accordingly. There
   was no middle course; either they must be accepted, or they must be
   done away with under more or less serious charges. But here an ironical
   Nemesis intervened, and has preserved for us some early forms of the
   New Testament (or copies of such forms) in which some portions of this
   literature still stand! Thus the New Testament, whose intention was to
   slay these works, was compelled to preserve some of them. [140] It is
   in this way that the first and second Epistles of Clement, the Epistle
   of Barnabas, Hermas, lastly also the Didache, have come down to us, as
   well as large portions of the Apocalypse of Peter, of the Acts of Paul,
   and of the Diatessaron of Tatian. At first, even after the rejection of
   the books, their treatment in the Churches was more indulgent than it
   afterwards became. The Muratorian Fragment, which rejects the Shepherd
   of Hermas, still favours the private reading of the book, and even as
   late as the fourth century "Antilegomena" are recommended by Athanasius
   for the instruction of catechumens. But even this connivance soon came
   to an end.

   This destructive influence of the New Testament had, however, yet wider
   scope. "Quid necesse est in manu sumere quod ecclesia non recipit,"
   says Jerome, and the Spanish bishops upheld the same view against
   Priscillian, with his noteworthy preference for Apocrypha. "Omne quod
   dicitur in libris canonicis," they declared, "quæritur et plus legisse
   peccare est." Here stands the very principle of Biblicism which,
   strictly applied, must have destroyed all Christian literature and must
   have cut off all hope of a future resurrection. The New Testament might
   have become a Koran! What need was there of other books? Either they
   contained what was in the New Testament, then they were superfluous; or
   they contained other things, then they were dangerous. The Roman
   Church, from the time of Damasus onwards, proceeded far along this
   road. Only read the Decretum Gelasianum! If things had gone in
   accordance with this decree, what would have been left for us of the
   literature of the first three centuries? Standing upon the New
   Testament it condemns practically everything else. Now it is true that
   the ordinances of this decree could assert their authority only to a
   limited extent, and that they were counteracted by other influences
   connected with the New Testament, of which we shall speak in the
   following paragraph; yet there can be no doubt that in the decree a
   judgment is expressed that tended to cramp Christian literary activity
   and to hinder the transmission of earlier works. The great lack of
   books always noticeable in the Early Church of Rome, and the literary
   unproductiveness of the Roman clergy, must be understood and judged
   from this point of view.

   But while pointing out the fact that the New Testament hindered the
   transmission of non-canonical Christian literature and continued to
   limit its production, we do not mean to assert that this was in every
   aspect disadvantageous. The hindrance was rather, especially in one
   special direction, truly happy in its consequences; for, as early as
   the second century, an inferior literature began to spring up in the
   Church, increasing in luxuriance from century to century--a literature
   that was greedily read and that threatened to stifle all feeling for
   historical truth and for simplicity and purity in religion--that
   confused mass of apocryphal acts of Apostles, fabricated stories of
   martyrs and ascetics, ghastly Apocalypses, inventions concerning the
   Childhood of Jesus, and the like. Side by side with the Canonical
   Scriptures this literature is represented in every quarter and in every
   language of the Church by works all essentially similar in character
   though varying somewhat according to the taste of the time. Much of
   this literature was really Apocryphal, i.e. it carried on a kind of
   underground existence, appearing again and again at the surface and
   exercising, in ever increasing degree, a most remarkable influence upon
   cultus and religious life. Not only many customs, but even Sacraments
   and Sacramental rites of the Catholic Church took their form under this
   influence. If the New Testament had not been in existence, the Church
   would have fallen a complete victim to this literature. [141] Standing,
   however, upon the New Testament, the Church repressed the Apocrypha and
   repeatedly forbade the reading of these books. The Rule of Faith was
   useless here; armed only with this, the Church would have been
   defenceless in this situation. But the New Testament safeguarded the
   Church, because it stood on a height to which these Apocrypha could no
   longer attain. It held these books down under its strong hand, and
   prevented their tendencies from coming to full development; it barred
   the way to the Ambo and Altar, and saved the true portrait of Jesus
   from complete obliteration. If the New Testament had not occupied since
   the beginning of the third century the position of central authority in
   the Church, all Churches would have probably become Ethiopian. There is
   no need of proof here; for there was absolutely no other authority in
   the Church except the New Testament that could have warded off the
   throttling hand of the Apocrypha.

   [137] How troublesome were such expressions as, "The god of this
   world," or the doctrines of Predestination and of the Divine hardening
   of the heart, or the teaching that the Law multiplied transgressions,
   etc.!

   [138] We not infrequently hear high praise given to the historical
   "tact" with which the books of the New Testament were selected; "tact,"
   however, played no part here. If we consider in the first place the
   Roman Canon at the end of the second century, "tact" resolves itself
   into a succession of historical necessities which originated in the
   practice of public lection and in a growing acceptance of the
   Apostolic-Catholic principle. These explain the acceptance of the four
   Gospels, of the collection of Pauline Epistles, and, finally, of the
   Acts of the Apostles. The latter book was accepted not through the
   exercise of historical "tact," but because the situation produced an
   instinctive demand for a book of all the Apostles. Even the reception
   of four Gospels was determined certainly not by historical "tact," but
   most probably could not have been avoided if it were wished to keep
   together the orthodox Christians of Asia. The Gospels of the Hebrews
   and of the Egyptians were in favour, we may definitely assume, with
   relatively small and isolated circles, and the Gospel of Peter was too
   late in its appearance. Moreover the expansion of the Canon to
   twenty-seven works, to be regretted by no one (what about 2 Peter?),
   was not due to the historical "tact" of the Church, but to the
   apostolic names of the authors of the added books. And it was because
   Hermas, 1 and 2 Clement, Barnabas, etc., could not satisfy the demand
   for apostolic origin that they were at last barred from the New
   Testament.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 5. Though the New Testament brought to an end the production of
   authoritative Christian writings, yet it cleared the way for
   theological and also for ordinary Christian literary activity.

   Whatever authorities might arise in the Church and whatever books might
   be written after the creation of the New Testament, they could no
   longer attain to the absolute prestige possessed by the New Testament.
   [142] They could be "inspired," but they could not longer become
   "canonical" in the sense of the New Testament. [143] Taken all in all,
   this was a blessing. The literature of enthusiasm now either ceased or
   was forced to confine itself within the narrow bounds which now
   restricted its significance and therefore its influence. Naturally the
   early belief that every Christian who wrote with a view to edification
   did this by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, now faded away. It was a
   belief that had placed the primitive Church in positions of terrible
   perplexity and afflicted conscientious authors with qualms of anxiety
   as to whether they were not guilty of presumption in taking up the pen.
   Clement of Alexandria still shows this anxiety--so also the
   anti-Montanist of Euseb., H.E., v. 16, 3 (vide supra, p. 37). But now
   this anxiety was no longer felt, and the way was free for the
   development of theological and ordinary Christian literature. Churchmen
   could at last with free conscience do what heretics had long
   done--compose theological treatises, write commentaries, publish
   edifying stories, and so forth. If only they made up their minds to be
   "true to Scripture," and in all due humility to serve the Church, no
   objection could be taken to their work. Indeed the New Testament itself
   created a demand for the most important part of this literature, for
   every sacred document must be explained and must be defended against
   false interpretations. Hence this form of literary activity became at
   once a matter of duty, and the corresponding literary productions as
   "Science of the New Testament," if we may use the expression, thus as
   "Bible-Science" at once acquired the freedom of the Church. Thus the
   New Testament, which as we saw in § 4 exercised in one particular
   direction a strongly cramping influence upon literature, in another
   direction promoted it and opened a new path for it. And what was there
   that did not come within the scope of the science of the Bible! If the
   Bible was a cosmos, like the universe, it needed for its interpretation
   simply every form of Science! And so since the beginning of the third
   century grew up, attached to the New Testament, the multiform Science
   of the Church, which began to compete with the Science of the Gnostics
   and drove it out of the field. In company with this there appeared a
   multitude of ecclesiastical treatises dealing with every possible
   problem of the Christian life. There was also a development of
   practical religious literature that raised no claim to stand on a level
   with the New Testament, but rather extracted from the New Testament the
   edifying teaching that it offered to the Churches. Lastly, the way was
   now opened even for a light literature with religious colouring; for
   the idea of literature was no longer objectionable, and one could make
   use of it in every direction so long as one paid due homage to the Holy
   Scriptures. All this had been brought about by the creation of the New
   Testament!

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. The New Testament obscured the true origin and the historical
   significance of the works which it contained, but on the other hand, by
   impelling men to study them, it brought into existence certain
   conditions favourable to the critical treatment and correct
   interpretation of these works.

   There is no need of many words to show how far the New Testament at
   first obscured the true origin and significance of the works which it
   contained. Within a sacred fundamental document everything must be
   regarded as equal in value, character, and significance. Canonising
   works like whitewash; it hides the original colours and obliterates all
   the contours. The Synoptics must be interpreted according to St John,
   the Pauline Epistles according to Acts: all stand on one plane. [144]
   But much more than this: each separate passage must contain the
   highest, the best, the most infallible that can be imagined in this
   connection, and everything must always sound in unison. The New
   Testament is the hen kai pan, and in reference to all theological
   questions it is sufficient, consistent, and clear. Under such
   presuppositions, how could the actual intention, or indeed anything of
   the original significance of the works, make themselves felt? Already
   in Tertullian--both in his own use of the New Testament as well as in
   that of his Lax opponents--we may observe all the fatal consequences
   for history of the canonisation of the books of the New Testament. Only
   one example! In St Matthew's Gospel Magi make their appearance and no
   fault seems to be found with them as such. Therefore concluded some Lax
   Churchmen, even a Christian might have dealings with magic. Tertullian
   could not with confidence reject this conclusion; for it was held as an
   axiom that what Holy Scripture does not blame it allows. [145] He
   therefore resorts to a way of escape--the Gospel states that the Magi
   returned home by another way; the other way, however, means that the
   Magi gave up their magic. [146] The inspired canonical document itself
   imposes the empirical and allegorical method of interpretation. Whether
   this method is employed "according to principles" and "scientifically,"
   or empirically case by case, makes no difference in the result: the
   original sense is always lost and the exegete no longer even seeks for
   it, but broods over the allegorical sense, i.e. over the thoughts which
   he has to read into the text.

   But, on the other hand, the instinct for simple truth is not so easily
   destroyed, and the New Testament to a certain extent came also to its
   help. The mere fact that works all of one historical period were here
   compiled together was an advantage. The careful observer could not but
   perceive that in many places they did actually complete and interpret
   one another. If he had had to deal with each particular book in
   isolation, how much more perplexed he would have been and how much less
   vivid must have been the impression he would have received from it!
   Now, however, once the New Testament had been created, there arose a
   real science of exegesis, not only the exegesis of allegory which
   sublimated and thus neutralised the content of the works, but an
   exegesis which concerned itself, if only in a limited degree, with
   their historical origin and their literal sense. Even the difficulties
   presented by the New Testament as a compilation of separate books
   rendered such investigations quite unavoidable for thoughtful
   Christians. If, for instance, there had been only one Canonical Gospel,
   Science would have simply capitulated to it; it would have been pure
   insolence for the human intellect to act otherwise; but the four
   Gospels in countless passages summoned the intellect to a work of
   reconciliation. Naturally recourse was had to harmonising; but even in
   harmonising there lies a true critical element, and in the very process
   of harmonising it can assert itself. Think only of the critical efforts
   of Julius Africanus, of Origen, and others who lived soon after the
   creation of the New Testament; one cannot but see that these efforts
   would never have been made if the works that they studied had not stood
   in a collection. Again, in the same collection the Pauline Epistles and
   the Acts of the Apostles stood face to face. This fact also challenged
   investigation, and every investigation educates the critical sense and
   inspires it to further efforts! There is, moreover, the fact that the
   method of Origen, the alchemist of theology, demanded the investigation
   of the literal as well as the spiritual sense, and that he showed a
   truly scientific interest in the discovery of the genuine text.
   Interest in the literal sense and the genuine text of early Christian
   works would scarcely have arisen if these works had not been combined
   in the New Testament and regarded as canonical. Accordingly the
   creation of the New Testament of itself called into being a critical
   and historical treatment of the canonical books.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [144] The unanimity of all the Apostles is an axiom for Tertullian in
   his controversy with Marcion. In several places he brings it to clear
   expression, e.g. De Pudic., 19: "Totius sacramenti interest nihil
   credere ab Joanne concessum quod a Paulo sit denegatum. Hanc
   equalitatem spiritus sancti qui observaverit, ab ipso deducetur in
   sensum eius."

   [145] Tertullian, it is true, would like to contest the validity of
   this axiom, but he does not feel that he is on sure ground in doing so.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 7. The New Testament checked the imaginative creation of events in
   the scheme of Salvation, whether freely or according to existing
   models; but it called forth or at least encouraged the intellectual
   creation of facts in the sphere of Theology, and of a Theological
   Mythology.

   Among historians no doubt can exist that the Gospel history contains a
   very large number of events that are unhistorical, more especially in
   the accounts of the Infancy and Resurrection (but also in other
   passages), and there is also no doubt that legends, whether connected
   with the scheme of Salvation or called forth by some other motive,
   continued to increase in number. Now we have already in § 4 called
   attention to one important fact about the New Testament, namely, that
   by its very existence as an authoritative document it severely
   restricted the growth of legend as this continued in the Apocryphal
   writings. We must now add that the New Testament in every direction,
   and to an extraordinary degree, exercised a moderating and restraining
   influence. When it was once created, leading Christians in the
   different Churches no longer allowed themselves to invent facts in
   connection with the scheme of Salvation, such as were invented in times
   past, whether by free imagination or according to existing models (the
   Descent into Hell, the Ascension, etc.). Rather it was felt that
   everything in the nature of fact had been already given in the New
   Testament, and that its narratives, even though they might be doctrinal
   in character, admitted of no additions of the nature of fact. A certain
   spirit of religious restraint took possession of a great part of the
   faithful--a spirit that, indeed, always makes its appearance where a
   sacred book comes into the foreground, for the book itself restrains
   even the most undisciplined imagination.

   But now mischief appeared from another quarter. The book stood as a
   sacred Canon. The interpreter of the book was guided by principles
   which affirmed absolute possibility of combination of passages from any
   part of the book, absolute perfection, absolute unanimity of the
   writers, the validity of allegorical interpretation, and so forth. Such
   principles would necessarily lead the interpreter to the construction
   of new facts generally hi the form of a mythology of ideas which the
   ancient mythology lived on, only in a higher sphere. What was there
   that one did not now learn about God, His Nature, His Trinity in Unity,
   His properties, His operation, etc., if one only made proper
   combinations! What was there that one was not able to say about Christ
   as Logos--before Creation, in Creation, after Creation up to His
   earthly manifestation, and again after His death! What was there that
   could not be culled from the New Testament concerning His two natures,
   and how much richer became even His earthly life if only the
   interpreter was skilful! Even a developed doctrine of the Holy Spirit
   could be constructed by exegesis! It is true that exegesis was always
   open to suggestions from the developing science of Dogmatics, and that
   it was forced to do much that it would never have done except at the
   bidding of Dogmatics; yet, apart from this, the New Testament itself,
   if its claims were accepted, necessitated this almost trivial and even
   revolting multiplication of mythological details without any feeling
   for reality or sense of history. Thus, though it is true that the New
   Testament has the merit of checking, indeed of partly stopping, the
   creation of new, authoritative, realistic legends, and of exercising a
   restraining influence upon the legends that already existed, yet, on
   the other hand, it partly summoned the intellect to, and partly
   encouraged it in, the creation of facts in the sphere of theology and
   of a theological mythology.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 8. The New Testament helped to demark a special period of Christian
   Revelation, and so in a certain sense to give Christians of later times
   an inferior status; yet it has kept alive the knowledge of the ideals
   and claims of Primitive Christianity.

   The delimitation of a period of fundamental Christian Revelation is in
   the first place to be explained as a reaction against Montanism, and
   the creation of the New Testament is in part the con-sequence of this
   conception (vide supra, pp. 35 f.). But as soon as the New Testament
   was created it became itself the strongest barrier in the line of
   division. The present time now appeared as a much inferior thing when
   compared with the time of Revelation, and accordingly the Christians of
   the present appeared inferior to the "heroes" of that time. This line
   of division it is true was not drawn in complete sharpness until the
   arrival of Protestantism--Catholicism possessed and still possesses
   points of view that help to attenuate it [147] --yet even to the
   Catholics of the third century the primitive times appeared as an
   heroic age, with which they scarcely dared to compare their own times
   (cf. what Origen says on this point). That time was still the epoch of
   "Spiritual Power," of miracle, and of pneumatic gifts; the present
   possessed such power only in smallest measure. There was also something
   comforting in this belief; for now one need not apply to oneself and to
   one's own time the high standard that those early Christians satisfied;
   at most it would still apply only and in part to the Clergy. [148] That
   the primitive epoch was unique was evident also from the fact that
   books like those of the New Testament could no longer be written. [149]
   If communion with God might only be reached with the help of a book,
   and if Divine direction could only be received by means of the same, it
   followed that the Church of the present was inferior to the Church of
   the past; there had been a classical time, but it had passed away; it
   had been brought to an end by the Book.

   But, on the other hand, if the Book had not been created, then it is
   most probable that even the memory of the forces and ideals that bore
   sway in Gospel history and throughout the Apostolic epoch would have
   vanished. Of what enormous importance it was that in the present the
   authentic records of that past time were still read again and again!
   How mighty has been the influence of the reading of the Gospels upon
   the character and course of Church history! Think of the part that has
   been played by the story of the Rich Young Man or the Sermon on the
   Mount, and of what it meant for the Church--that Augustine, at the
   critical moment, opened the Epistle to the Romans! Though no one any
   longer dared to set himself on the level of the New Testament, still
   this Book, just because as an authoritative collection it was more or
   less accessible to all, was a continuous source of power that raised
   the weak men of the present to heights of perfection. What would have
   happened if, with the Old Testament, we had received the Didache or the
   Apostolic Canons and Constitutions as a second Canon, instead of the
   New Testament? Thus here also the New Testament worked in two contrary
   directions it lowered and also raised the tone! It has blunted the
   conscience of many--no one can attain to the height of the New
   Testament, nor need one--and it has also acted as a spur to the
   conscience. It has guarded Christianity from the rank growth of
   emotionalism, but it certainly has also repressed many a primitive and
   vital impulse. How many Christians of note with original Christian
   experience have as "Bible-believers" entangled themselves in the Book,
   have suffered themselves to be disturbed, hindered, directed by texts
   of the Bible, and in consequence have not brought their character and
   innate gift to perfect development, and have lost their freedom! What
   mischief has been wrought by the Revelation of John just because it
   stood in the New Testament! What terrible perplexities of conscience
   have been brought about by certain sayings of St Paul just because they
   be-longed to the Canon! And yet, on the other hand, how unspeakable the
   blessing that has flowed from passages of the Bible which, just because
   they were canonical, filled men's hearts with confidence steadfast as a
   rock!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [147] One need think not only of monasticism but also of the saints of
   all ages and the Evangelical Counsels.

   [148] Note how Tertullian as a Montanist scoffs at this attitude, De
   Monog., 12: "Cum extollimur et inflamur adversus clerum tunc unum omnes
   sumus, tunc omnes sacerdotes, quia sacerdotes nos deo et patri fecit.
   Cum ad peraequationem disciplinae sacerdotalis provocamur, deponimus
   infulas et impares sumus."

   [149] Even a Tertullian challenges Marcion: "Exhibeat Marcion dei sui
   dona, aliquos prophetas . . . edat aliquem psalmum, aliquem visionem,
   aliquam orationem, dumtaxat spiritualem, in ecstasi, i.e. amentia si
   qua linguæ interpretio accessit," etc. (Adv. Marc., v. 8).
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 9. The New Testament promoted and completed the fatal identification
   of the Word of the Lord and the Teaching of the Apostles; but, because
   it raised Pauline Christianity to a place of highest honour, it has
   introduced into the history of the Church a ferment rich in blessing.

   In the course of the second century the Word of the Lord and the
   teaching of the Apostles became came more and more intimately
   identified with one another (vide supra, p. 48: hemeis kai Petron kai
   tous allous apostolous apodechometha hos Christon) [150] ; to this
   process the New Testament set its seal. The consequences of this
   identification, not only for Christian Dogmatics but also for the
   Christian life, were immeasurable and as a rule unfavourable. Not only
   was religion thereby transformed into the doctrine of the Apostles, but
   also one was now forced to give to particular and very subjective
   utterances and injunctions of St Paul a weight, which even that
   exacting Apostle would never have desired. Though the sayings of the
   Gospel still preserved their special significance for the conduct of
   life, they yet acquired a powerful rival in the injunctions of St Paul.
   What, however, was more serious was that, because of this
   identification, Christology not only took its place beside Christ but
   even threatened to push Him aside--indeed actually did so. The simplest
   consideration of the picture of Jesus as given in the Gospel suffered
   from the troubling and obscuring influence of this "doctrine of the New
   Testament." It is not possible nor is it necessary to dilate upon this
   point; but let it be remembered that St Paul also had in the end to
   suffer from this identification. For after a way had been opened for a
   more liberal conception of the New Testament and a more unbiassed
   estimate of historical events and persons, critics still made demands
   of this man as a person and an author that they made of no other man.
   This disposition was only a lasting relic of the old conception; men's
   minds were ever haunted by the spectre of the Canon. Either they laid
   violent hands on the man, robbed him of a part of his soul, and
   modelled him into a figure of strictly logical consistency--for was he
   not once Paul of the New Testament? and even if he is that no longer,
   still he must be a type--or they were disgusted with him, heaped upon
   him complaints and reproaches which they would never have made if they
   had not received him out of the New Testament. Still this martyrdom of
   the Apostle continues; still critics who are elsewhere impartial will
   not allow him a man's right to be more and also less than his own type
   and his own ideal.

   Nevertheless, this identification of the Word of the Lord and Pauline
   doctrine has been full of blessing in an important direction. The New
   Testament, through the acceptance of the Pauline Epistles, has
   established as a standard the loftiest expression of the consciousness
   of Salvation and of the religion of Faith. Accordingly the New
   Testament, once it was created, exercised an extraordinarily important
   influence upon the development in the Church of the second century, by
   which the Christian religion was on the point of being definitely
   established as the Religion of the New Law. If things had gone further
   in the Church simply on the lines marked out for us in Barnabas,
   Hermas, 2 Clement, and the apologists, all Christianity would have been
   gradually reduced within the meagre conception of a new, even though
   more spiritual, legalism, and at last Marcionites and Gnostics would
   have been the only people that definitely placed the idea of Salvation
   in the centre of their religion. That this did not happen is due in
   great measure to the New Testament--that is, to the fact that the
   Pauline Epistles were in the Canon, though not, it is true, to that
   fact alone. Only consider how important the Pauline Epistles were for
   the thought and teaching of Irenæus, how impossible for him such
   conceptions apart from these epistles as an absolute authority! Only
   think what decisive influence the Pauline doctrine of justification
   exercised in the controversy between Calixtus and the Rigorists
   concerning penance already at the beginning of the third century!
   Remember only how the idea of Salvation "by Faith alone" slowly gained
   ground in the religious thought of the Church until, in the line of
   Jovinian and others, it at last came to full development in (Ambrose
   and) Augustine! [151] All this was accomplished by Paul because he
   stood in the New Testament. And now further remember what reformations
   in the course of the history of the Church have been brought about by
   Paul accepted in the Canon, and what a ferment his teaching has ever
   been! Up to and beyond the time of the Jansenists Paul is still always
   at work in the Catholic Church--to say nothing of the German
   Reformation--and forcibly reminds her what Religion at its best should
   be and is, and what Faith and Sonship mean. The Apostle would have been
   shut off from all these activities if he had not come into the New
   Testament. Whether they outweigh the disadvantages that have resulted
   from the identification of the "Word of the Lord" and the "Teaching of
   the Apostles," who can tell?

   Christ.

   § 10. In the New Testament the Catholic Church forged for herself a new
   weapon with which to ward off all heresy as unchristian; but she has
   also found in it a court of control before which she has appeared ever
   increasingly in default.

   The New Testament was not created as a weapon in the conflict against
   heresy; there were many things in it that rendered it a very
   inconvenient weapon in this conflict, [152] and that forced Tertullian
   to give the rather questionable and, indeed, useless warning not to
   engage in exegetical controversies with heretics, seeing that victory
   in such conflicts was uncertain or even improbable. Yet, however that
   might be, the New Testament, when once it was in existence, did form an
   excellent means of defence and offence against heresy. In the first
   place one might now simply adopt the standpoint: he who does not accept
   Scripture is eo ipso no Christian--there was thus no need of further
   discussion. Or just as one denied to the Jews their property in the Old
   Testament, so now, by declaring that the New Testament belonged to the
   Church by Divine grant, one might chase heretics away from this Book
   and proclaim it to be abominable insolence, theft, and robbery that
   they should even venture a claim to the books contained in the New
   Testament. Such is already Tertullian's procedure (De Præsc., 37); "Non
   Christiani nullum ius capiunt Christianarum litterarum, ad quos merito
   dicendum est: qui estis? quando et unde venitis? quid in meo agitis,
   non mei? quo denique, Marcion, iure silvam meam cædis? qua licentia,
   Valentine, fontes meos transvertis? qua potestate, Apelles, limites
   meos commoves? mea est possessio, quid hie, ceteri, ad voluntatem
   vestram seminatis et pascitis? mea est possessio, olim (?) possideo,
   prior possideo . . . ego sum hæres apostolorum!" The Church regarded
   the New Testament as her own peculiar possession divinely granted; she
   named herself the Church of the New Covenant with the same title as the
   book; in conflict, if it seemed fitting, she retired simply into this
   fortress; and firmly established herself, and gradually her adversaries
   also, in the conviction that Church and New Testament formed an
   exclusive unity, so that none but the Church had a right to the works
   contained in the Canon.

   But in the New Testament the Church had created a possession that from
   her point of view was of very questionable advantage. Her Rule of Faith
   could be stretched, and was capable of development. The Church managed
   with it not so badly; when necessary, she treated it as invariable;
   where need became imperative, she modified and developed it, and could
   always draw a veil over these developments, such as they were. But it
   stood otherwise with the New Testament; littera manet! Even here, it is
   true, much that was desirable could be accomplished by manipulation,
   namely, by "interpretation"; but the letter full often set impassable
   bounds to such operations. The existence of a written fundamental
   document that could be held up as a mirror before the Church must have
   become as time went on more and more inconvenient and dangerous. And it
   was so employed--by no means only by heretics, but, at first rarely and
   reluctantly, then more and more frequently, by faithful members of the
   Church. A beginning was already made by Origen, who earnestly and
   conscientiously measures the Church by the standard of the New
   Testament; and numbers of preachers in the Ancient Church followed his
   example. They themselves had no thought of leaving the Church because
   on the ground of the New Testament they had found so much fault with
   her; but even in their times the official Church had begun to consider
   whether she could tolerate members that with a certain recklessness
   held up the mirror before her, and she ended by deciding that she could
   not. Her judgment to-day is still the same. Yet since the time of the
   Waldensians and the Franciscans, what assaults have been made upon the
   Church from the base of the New Testament! What foes have drawn their
   weapons from this armoury and have forced the Church to fight hard for
   life! It is because the Church carried the New Testament with herself
   and before herself that reformations, that the Reformation, became
   possible; and the Reformed Church at least, because she must recognise
   this New Testament, must accept all that is drawn from this Book for
   her correction. Thus this collection of sacred writings has proved a
   great arsenal and a court of appeal for critics of the Church! When it
   was created, who could have suspected that this would be? The old
   proverb, "Habent sua fata libelli," has here received most remarkable
   confirmation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [152] This inconvenience was so keenly felt by Tertullian, that he even
   felt compelled to invent a theory by which it might be removed. Seeing
   that heresies "must arise," the Old Testament and New Testament contain
   passages that could give rise to heresy; see especially De Resurr., 63:
   "Quia hæreses esse oportuerat, ut probabiles quique manifestentur, hæ
   autem sine aliquibus occasionibus scripturarum audere non poterant,
   idcirco pristina instrumenta quasdam materias illis videntur
   subministrasse, et ipsas quidem iisdem litteris revincibiles." It is
   true that he does not feel comfortable about this theory if it is to
   stand alone; therefore as a Montanist he proceeds: "Sed quoniam nec
   dissimulare spiritum sanctum oportebat quominus et huiusmodi eloquiis
   superinundaret quæ multis hæreticorum versutiis semina subspargerent,
   immo et veteres illorum cespites vellerent, idcirco iam omnes retro
   ambiguitates et quas volunt parabolas aperta atque perspicua totius
   sacramenti prædicatione discussit per novam prophetiam de paracleto
   inundantem."
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 11. The New Testament has hindered the natural impulse to give to the
   content of Religion a simple, clear, and logical expression, but, on
   the other hand, it has preserved Christian doctrine from becoming a
   mere philosophy of Religion.

   Speaking exactly, we may say that Religion, when it has a sacred
   fundamental document, no longer requires Doctrine; for the content of
   the document is itself the Doctrine. But when the New Testament was
   created the Church already had a doctrine; indeed, as we have seen,
   this doctrine itself helped to create the New Testament. Doctrinal
   teaching could not be, nor ought it to have been, rendered superfluous
   and thrust aside by the new written work; and it continued to be
   carried on in the Church. But all doctrine, however supernatural it may
   be in its foundations, depends for its exposition upon reason, and with
   the help of reason necessarily aims at simple and clear expression. As
   soon, however, as a sacred document comes into existence, doctrine
   begins to depend less and less on reason for its development; for each
   rational element can now be replaced by an authoritative element. The
   consequence is that both rational and authoritative elements are
   intermingled in the development of doctrine, that everyone becomes
   accustomed to such intermingling, and that the sense and desire for
   clear and logical thinking gradually become dulled. All this is
   exemplified to full extent in the history of the development of Dogma
   in the Church. We may observe it already in Irenæus, in Tertullian with
   special clearness, and in Origen. They operate with ratio and with
   autoritas, i.e. with proofs from Scripture, and interchange the two
   elements at will. A text from the New Testament is for them as good a
   proof as a logical argument. The result for the dogmatist was a
   tremendous and increasing relief from logical responsibility, and a
   corresponding increase in the patchiness and incoherence of doctrine.
   If the dogmatist was at a loss for an argument, a passage of Scripture
   came to his help; if doubts arose in his mind, they were repressed by a
   word of Scripture; if a proof could not be found, it was supplied by a
   verse of Scripture; if discrepancies were met with, these need only be
   so in appearance, for Scripture contains discrepancies, and yet
   Scripture is absolutely consistent. This condition of things gradually
   affected Dogmatics, and with the narcotic of Scriptural authority
   paralysed the intellect in its restless search for truth. We can
   observe these evil effects in case of a great genius like Augustine;
   how much more quick and ready may lesser spirits have been to dispense
   with real consistency, perspicuity, and logical proof in their teaching
   of the Faith! In truth the Dogmatic of the Church is a creation that
   scorns logical stringency, and the dogmatist, if he only has given "the
   teaching of Scripture," can feel dispensed from what is his chief task.

   But also from another side the New Testament paralysed the intellectual
   instinct to give to the content of religion simple and consistent
   expression. If all that stood in the New Testament must count as sacred
   and "written for our instruction," then indeed was it an absolutely
   hopeless undertaking to gather all this into a single system of
   doctrine. And if the whole varied content of the New Testament belonged
   to "Religion," then it was now an impossible task here to introduce
   arrangement and system. Thus the whole idea of Religion as an objective
   and subjective unity was obscured. Religion is everything that stands
   in the New Testament: How then can a sound doctrine of religion exist
   at all? However, fortunately, the intellect found a base of action in
   the Rule of Faith, and intellectual effort based upon the Rule of Faith
   proved stronger than the paralysing influence of the varied matter of
   the New Testament upon Dogmatics; and yet in hundreds of instances,
   and, indeed, from the beginning, the New Testament has exercised a
   disturbing, paralysing, and disintegrating influence upon Dogmatics.

   And yet--here also there is another side to the account: The New
   Testament has again and again brought Dogmatics back to history, and
   has thereby preserved it from changing into mere Philosophy of
   Religion. We can observe the working of this influence from the first
   days, and even in the dogmatic developments of the nineteenth century
   it has continued to be fraught with blessing. What a different aspect
   the Dogmatic of Origen would have had--and indeed to its
   disadvantage--if he had not always kept himself in touch with the New
   Testament, if he had not felt obliged to speak in unison with that
   Book! If only separate works and not an already collected New Testament
   had been at his hand, his Dogmatic would have been much more
   neo-Platonic in its results than it already is. And what a debt
   Augustine, as a dogmatist, owes to the New Testament! Without the
   Gospels and the Pauline Epistles as canonical authorities, he would
   never have been delivered from the scepticism of the Academy nor would
   he have accomplished that deepening of the neo-Platonic philosophy by
   which he has transformed it in some of its speculations into pure
   religion. Thus though the Dogmatic of the Church be ever so patchy,
   incoherent, and self-discrepant in the form that it has taken, the fact
   that it has not completely lost contact with real life and history is
   due to the New Testament.
     __________________________________________________________________

   In the foregoing pages an attempt has been made to survey and set in
   order the most important consequences of the Creation of the New
   Testament. This task belongs to the historian of the Origin of the
   Sacred Collection--not only because practically all these consequences
   made their appearance with the Book itself, but also because from the
   consequences we can gain a clearer and more certain knowledge of the
   motives which produced the Book, and because in these consequences the
   real character of the Book first appears. It is true, as has been
   shown, that consequences do not always correspond to motives--a
   creation very speedily creates its own law and follows its own
   logic--but knowledge of the coming into being of the New Testament is
   imperfect so long as an account is not given of what really came into
   being in this case. Therefore it is much to be desired that, for the
   future, histories of the "Origin of the Canon of the New Testament"
   should not be written without a description of the innate functions and
   consequences of the factor introduced into the history of the Church by
   the appearance of the New Testament. The investigation of the history
   of the New Testament from Origen and still more from Athanasius
   downwards is, except in a few important points, only of interest to
   scholars; but to know what the New Testament meant to the Church as
   soon as it was created belongs to general theological culture.

APPENDIX I (to § 2 of Part I, pp. 59 f.)

  The Marcionite Prologues to the Pauline Epistles

   (The most ancient authority is Codex Fuldensis, but they also appear in
   at least thirteen other Codices)

   Gal.--Galatæ sunt Græci[!]. hi verbum veritatis primum ab apostolo
   acceperunt, sed post discessum eius temptati sunt a falsis apostolis,
   ut in legem et circumcisionem verterentur. hos apostolus revocat ad
   fidem veritatis scribens eis ab Epheso.

   Cor.--Corinthi sunt Achaici. et hi similiter ab apostolo audierunt
   verbum veritatis et subversi multifarie a falsis apostolis, quidam a
   philosophiæ verbosa eloquentia [better: ad phil. verbosam eloquentiam],
   alii a secta [better: ad sectam] legis Judaicæ inducti sunt. hos
   revocat apostolus ad veram evangelicam sapientiam scribens eis ab
   Epheso per Timotheum.

   Rom.--Romani sunt in partibus Italiæ. hi præventi sunt a falsis
   apostolis et sub nomine domini nostri Jesu Christi in legem et
   prophetas erant inducti. hos revocat apostolus ad veram evangelicam
   fidem scribens a Corintho.

   Thess.--Thessalonicenses sunt Macedones. hi accepto verbo veritatis
   perstiterunt in fide etiam in persecutione civium suorum; præterea nec
   receperunt ea quæ a falsis apostolis dicebantur. hos conlaudat
   apostolus scribens eis ab Athenis.

   Laudic. (=Eph.).--[Laudiceni sunt Asiani. hi præventi erant a
   pseudo-apostolis . . . ad hos non accessit ipse apostolus . . . hos per
   epistulam recorrigit. . . .]

   Col.--Colossenses et hi sicut Laudicenses sunt Asiani, et ipsi præventi
   erant a pseudo-apostolis, nec ad hos accessit ipse apostolus, sed et
   hos per epistulam recorrigit; audierunt enim verbum ab Archippo qui et
   ministerium in eos accepit. ergo apostolus iam ligatus scribit eis ab
   Epheso.

   Phil.--Philippenses sunt Macedones. hi accepto verbo veritatis
   perstiterunt in fide nec receperunt falsos apostolos. hos conlaudat
   scribens eis a Roma de carcere per Epaphroditum.

   Philem.--Philemoni familiares litteras facit pro Onesimo servo eius;
   scribit autem ei a Roma de carcere.

   These Prologues were first recognised as really Marcionite by De Bruyne
   (Rev. Bénéd., 1907, Jan., pp. 1-16), who thus made a particularly
   important contribution to our knowledge of the history of the New
   Testament. He has absolutely proved that these Prologues belong
   together (those to the Pastoral Epistles are of a different character);
   that they are to be ascribed to the Marcionites; and from them came
   into the Church. [153] The uniform character of the Prologues, taken in
   conjunction with the fact that "lex et circumcisio" (Gal.) = "lex et
   prophetæ" (Rom.) = "secta legis Judaicæ," suffices to assure us on this
   point. The Prologues accordingly reject as false the Christianity that
   upholds the Old Testament, and call the great Church a Jewish sect.
   They evidently identify the original Apostles, or all missionaries of
   their party, [154] with the Jewish opponents of St Paul, and describe
   as false every mission before that of St Paul. Where such missions had
   taken place, Paul must "revocare" or "recorrigere" (Rom., Laod., Col.).
   Where missions had followed him, he must likewise "revocare" (Gal.,
   Cor.). It is, however, especially characteristic that all the epistles
   (except the epistula familaris to Philemon) have been searched only for
   information as to the attitude of the respective Churches towards the
   "verbum veritatis" (Gal., Cor., Thess., Phil.) or to the "fides
   veritatis" (Gal.), the "vera evangelica sapientia" (Cor.), the "vera
   evangelica fides" (Rom.), and the "fides" (Thess., Phil.). Under these
   suitably varying expressions Pauline Christianity (assumed to be
   independent of the Old Testament) is always to be understood. [155]
   This point of view is simply imposed upon Thessalonians and
   Philippians. In the Prologue to Colossians "verbum" without the epithet
   "veritatis" probably means the false Gospel.

   These Prologues show that the Marcionite "Apostolus" influenced the
   "Apostolus" of the Church, and one feels that this must have happened
   at a very early period. They have not yet been found in Greek form; but
   something can be said in favour of a Greek original. The notices
   concerning the places where each letter was written deserve attention
   seeing that they are so ancient. Since Philippians and Philemon are
   described as having been written from Rome, it is allowable to question
   whether the words in the prologue to Colossians: "Apostolus ligatus
   (surely the Roman captivity is meant) scribit eis ab Epheso" are in
   order, although they do suit an hypothesis that has been revived only
   lately that Colossians was written in Ephesus. Perhaps we should read
   "a Roma per Epaphram" (confusion of "Epaphras" and "Ephesus"). These
   Prologues were not written for the educated, but for quite simple
   people; the writer even thinks it necessary to write: "Romani sunt in
   partibus Italiæ." No Western could have done this. The geographical
   notices would suit the hypothesis that the Prologues were originally
   composed for Christians of Pontus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [153] This view is accepted by Wordsworth-White (Novum Testamentum
   Latine, ii. 1, 1913, pp. 41 f. ).--The order of the ten epistles was
   here originally, as the discoverer has acutely shown, that of the
   Marcionites.

   [154] The false apostles that, according to the prologue to Cor.,
   "multifarie" led astray the Corinthians, are certainly in the first
   place Peter and Apollos.

   [155] We note by the way that "veritas" ("verus") is a genuine
   Marcionite watchword, derived from the Epistle to the Galatians, the
   most important epistle for Marcion (Gal. ii. 5: he aletheia tou
   euangeliou).

APPENDIX II (to § 1-4 of Part I)

  Forerunners and Rivals of the New Testament

   Those collections of authoritative Christian works that, according to
   early indications in the course of the development of the New
   Testament, might have come into existence but have not come down to us,
   call for thorough investigation; here let it suffice to give a list of
   them accompanied by some words of explanation. Something has already
   been said about them in the text of this book. I count seven of these
   embryonic collections:

   1. A collection of late Jewish and Christian prophetic-messianic or
   prophetic-hortatory books inserted in the Old Testament--thus an
   expanded and corrected Old Testament.

   2. A collection of (late Jewish and) Christian prophetic books standing
   independently side by side with the Old Testament.

   3. A simple collection of Sayings of the Lord, like the common source
   of St Matthew and St Luke (Q), standing side by side with the Old
   Testament.

   4. A written Gospel, or a collection of several Gospels containing the
   history of the Crucified and Risen Lord, together with His teaching and
   commands, standing side by side with the Old Testament.

   5. A Gospel (or several), with in addition a more or less comprehensive
   collection of inspired Christian works of the most different character
   and graded prestige, standing side by side with the Old Testament.

   6. A systematised "Teaching of the Lord" administered by the "Twelve
   Apostles" of the character of the "Apostolic Canons, Constitutions,
   etc.," which also included "Injunctions of the Lord," side by side with
   the Old Testament and the Gospel.

   7. A book of the synthesis or concordance of prophecy and fulfilment in
   reference to Jesus Christ, the Apostles, and the Church, standing side
   by side with the Old Testament.

   It can still be shown that in the second century each of these "New
   Testaments," or additions to the Old Testament, not only were possible,
   but were already actually present in embryo; and further it can be
   shown why they did not come to full life, or perished.

   1. Still, even at the end of the second century, Tertullian was of the
   opinion that the Book of Enoch must be included in the Old Testament;
   this book as well as the Apocalypse of Ezra, the Assumpsion of Moses
   and others were not only read by Jewish Christians, but had also
   penetrated to Gentile Christians, and were reverenced by them as books
   of revelation, as is proved by numerous quotations from these works
   (first and second centuries). [156] Christians took upon themselves to
   correct the Old Testament and even to interpolate whole verses (vide
   Justin, Dial. c. Trypho). Christian Apocalypses attained the highest
   prestige as soon as they were published. It was accordingly to be
   expected that, as the simplest way of developing the litera scripta
   given in the Old Testament, the ancient Canon would be enlarged by the
   addition of new works, and that thus in the most obvious way the whole
   Canon might have been declared to be the property of Christians and not
   of Jews. This was, indeed, very nearly being done, and the inclusion of
   the Shepherd of Hermas in many (Western) exemplars of the Old
   Testament, even in the Middle Ages, may count as an important relic of
   this tendency. The possibility of giving the Shepherd a place in the
   Old Testament is considered even in the Muratorian Fragment, but is
   rejected because the Old Testament is closed. From the fact that this
   reason is stated so emphatically, we may probably conclude that it was
   not yet clear to everyone. The growing demand for books of the "New
   Covenant"--corresponding to the increasing perception in the Church of
   the limitations of the Old Covenant--and the new attitude that the
   Church was compelled to adopt towards prophecy since the middle of the
   second century, repressed the tendency that would have realised itself
   in No. 1.

   2. It was also conceivable that the prophetic books to be added to the
   Old Testament should form a Canon of their own. The difference from No.
   1 would not have been very great, yet it would have been considerable;
   for the idea of a second Canon would have been formed and realised--an
   idea that implied an enhanced Christian self-consciousness. The new
   Canon would have expressed the feeling that Christians found themselves
   living in a new epoch (vide Acts ii. 17 f.), wherein "the Spirit was
   poured upon all flesh, even upon the servants and handmaids." The Book
   of Revelation makes the strongest claim to be regarded as an
   authoritative prophecy and presupposes that it would be read by the
   Churches; but one cannot imagine that its author ever intended that his
   book should be inserted in the Old Testament; he surely meant that it
   should stand side by side with that book. [157] Tertullian's attitude
   towards the Montanist collection of prophecies is very significant. The
   New Testament was already in existence for him, and yet he wishes the
   Montanist collection to be attached to the "Instrumentum" of the
   Church: the thought of a new prophetic Canon is to him not repellent,
   but simply natural. (More details will be given in Appendix III.) If he
   had not had to reckon with a New Testament already in existence, it
   follows that he would have wished the new prophetic collection to be
   added to the Old Testament as a second Canon. A foundation for this
   idea, therefore, must have existed from primitive times. The same
   considerations and influences that made No. 1 impossible have prevented
   us from receiving the new Canon in the form of No. 2: prophecy as such
   had fallen in value when compared with what was historic and apostolic.

   3. Very soon--indeed during Apostolic times and in Palestine--the
   primitive formula of authority the "Scriptures and the Lord" was recast
   so that "the Lord" found expression in a loosely ordered collection of
   Injunctions and Sayings of the Lord (Q). For a time the Churches were
   satisfied with this. But though the simple conception of "The
   Scriptures and the Lord," as the final appeal, was very tenacious of
   life--it can be traced even into the fourth century as if no New
   Testament were in existence--yet it very soon became manifest that the
   expression of the term "the Lord" in the form of a single collection of
   Sayings was insufficient, and it was soon displaced by No. 4. [158]

   4. "The Old Testament and the (written) Gospel," or "the Old Testament
   and the written (four) Gospels": for a time it seemed as if such an
   arrangement would have sufficed for all. Most probably all Churches
   passed through this stage, and, according to the "Didaskalia" preserved
   in Syriac, it lasted in certain Eastern Churches up to the middle of
   the third century. In the "Gospel" or the "Gospels" was included the
   story of the Crucified and Risen Lord together with His teaching and
   injunctions (in some also with a preliminary history). This arrangement
   of the litera scripta seemed to satisfy all needs, and from many points
   of view we can regret that the Churches did not abide by it. We have
   already shown (pp. 42 ff.) what were the requirements and
   considerations that urged the Churches to a further step. [159] From
   these we also learn that the advance was not by any means altogether
   detrimental.

   5. The characteristic of this form is that although the idea of a
   collection of books of the "New Covenant" in addition to the Gospel
   (the Gospels) has at last been realised, yet no clearness prevails as
   to the principle according to which further authoritative books are to
   be added to the Gospels. The second half of the collection is still
   quite formless and is therefore destitute of boundaries, nor is it
   closed against other works. So long, however, as it was formless it was
   in an insecure and dangerous position. The principle of the Apostolic
   is not yet accepted or is not yet applied strictly. This is the
   condition of things presupposed by Clement of Alexandria and also by
   the Catalogus Claramontanus [160] ; like all amorphous things it could
   not last and was defenceless against all kinds of questionable
   additions, [161] and so the formless was gradually replaced everywhere
   by the formed New Testament. [162]

   6. The idea that led to this form of an authoritative Christian litera
   scripta is the most daring, most independent, and most interesting of
   all. It continued to assert itself in the Church even after the
   creation of the New Testament, indeed it experienced a still further
   development, and up to the present day has not been disavowed in the
   Catholic Churches. Accordingly even to-day the New Testament has a
   rival at its side, a rival that now, indeed, (and for a long time past)
   must be contented with a more modest rôle, yet a recognised rival. This
   rival is older than the New Testament, for already at the beginning of
   the second century or somewhat later it appeared on the stage in the
   "Didache," i.e. "The Teaching of the Lord by the Twelve Apostles"
   (which some say dates from the end of the first century). This
   Apostolic Teaching of the Lord professes to give the ethical commands
   of the Lord and His authoritative directions for the ordering of the
   life and worship of the Church. The author depends partly upon the
   Gospel, partly upon late Jewish forms of catechetical instruction
   interpreted in the sense of the Sermon on the Mount, and for the rest
   he ventures to trace back the ordinances, that had taken form in the
   Churches, to the Lord through the Apostles, because he is convinced of
   their authenticity. An undertaking, indeed, that was as practical as it
   was daring! But, unfortunately, further developments became infected by
   the spirit of deceit, indeed of falsehood. All these were codified by
   the Church in the firm conviction that her principles, all that she
   had, all that she required, had been granted and would be granted to
   her by the Lord through the Apostles. At that time and for centuries
   afterwards the Churches did what is now done only by the Pope! This
   procedure--it was in fact nothing else than the codification of
   Tradition--if it had been everywhere accepted might have rendered the
   New Testament, or at least the "Apostolus," quite superfluous. This
   literature did, indeed, gain increasing acceptance; but because it
   never could give the same impression of unassailable authenticity as
   did works Apostolic in form and title, and because it, for some unknown
   reason, never found its way into public lection, it could not hinder
   the development of the New Testament or, rather, of the "Apostolus."
   And yet it kept a place side by side with the New Testament, and thus
   from the Didache, or rather from the idea that lay at the root of the
   Didache, arose that great body of pseudonomous Apostolic literature of
   Canons and Constitutions. In this literature--the history of which and
   of its varying prestige in the Church has not yet been sufficiently
   investigated--the Apostolic Canons then attained such a prominent
   position that they were recognised in due form as Apostolic by the
   Catholic Churches, and actually took their place beside the New
   Testament; while the ancient Didache, at first included in the formless
   second division of the Holy Scriptures in Egypt, was since the time of
   Origen and under his influence thrust ever nearer to the edge of the
   precipice. At last it was pushed over after it had for some time lasted
   as a textbook in the religious instruction of catechumens (according to
   the direction of Athanasius). [163]

   7. There was also a possibility that the Church might have received a
   book of the synthesis or concordance of prophecy and fulfilment in
   place of the New Testament. First attempts towards such a work are
   plainly enough discernible. Consider only those parts of Barnabas, of
   the writings of Justin (also of the pseudo-Justinian work, De
   Monarchia), of Tertullian (Adv. Jud. and Adv. Marc., ii., iii.) that
   deal with such concordance. Such a work could have satisfied, so it
   seems, all present requirements that were not satisfied by the Old
   Testament; for if all prophecies referring to Christ, His Apostles, and
   the Church with her institutions (Baptism, the Lord's Supper, etc.) had
   been collected from the Old Testament and set side by side with
   instances of their fulfilment, Christians would have had a book of
   catechetical instruction together with the necessary historical
   material. It is a remarkable fact that though such a work did not come
   into being because no one could put it into form (if a skilful author
   had appeared and had made such a collection, it would almost certainly
   have become canonical), [164] nevertheless its opposite, the antitheses
   of Marcion, did actually come into being, and was accepted as canonical
   in an heretical Church. This work, which we may imagine to have been a
   large and comprehensive production, and which accompanied the New
   Testament of Marcion, aimed at proving the discordance of the Old
   Testament with Christianity at all points. The Marcionite Church,
   therefore, is itself a witness of the importance for the Church of
   proving the concordance, and that it was well within the limits of
   possibility that a work of this kind with canonical prestige should
   have been produced.

   There were thus seven starting-points of development that could have
   led to collections of works competing with the growing New Testament,
   and in part these developments did not only start, but actually took
   definite form. It is in this connection alone that the full
   significance of the creation of the New Testament becomes clear. We see
   that it was not the only possible new Canon and that it developed as
   the consequence of difficulties, tendencies, and strivings of various
   kinds. It still remains to discuss briefly what it would have meant for
   the Church, and especially for the expression of "ius divinum" in the
   Church, if one of the other forms had established itself instead of the
   New Testament.

   The New Testament, in the form which it attained, at once acquired a
   threefold significance for the Church. It is (1) the authentic, because
   Apostolic authority for the history of Salvation through Jesus Christ,
   and as such, compels belief. (2) It fulfils what was foreshadowed in
   the Old Testament, and while recognising the Divine origin of that book
   yet assigns to it only a preparatory significance. It is (3) the
   "instrumentum divinum," i.e. the authentic codification of the Divine
   laws and ordinances to be observed by the Church and the individual
   Christian. From this point of view it gives equal weight to the word of
   Christ and to the word of the Apostles, but it also exercised a certain
   sifting criticism on the ordinances of the "instrumentum divinum" of
   the Old Testament.

   Now if No. 1 had established itself there would have been only indirect
   documentary authority for the history of Salvation through Jesus
   Christ; here prophecy would have continued in the leading position, and
   only isolated notices and testimonies from the history of Christ, such
   as are found in early Christian prophetical works (e.g. the
   Revelation), would have found a place beside prophecy. Moreover, the
   distinction between the New and the Old Covenant would not have come to
   clear expression, rather most that is distinctive in the Old Testament
   would have been obliterated by means of allegorical interpretation. The
   same consideration would apply to the "ius divinum." The laws of the
   Old Testament and the new Christian laws, if such had, indeed, taken
   form within the enlarged Canon, would have become indiscriminately
   confused seeing that the former would have been spiritualised where
   necessary. The New Testament, on the contrary, had the significance,
   which cannot be too highly valued, that it enabled the Church to set
   certain limits to the allegorical method of interpretation as applied
   to the Old Testament, and thus to give a fair opportunity for an
   historical understanding of the Old Testament. [165] If we had been
   left simply with an Old Testament enriched with Christian elements
   everything would have been overwhelmed by a mist of allegory and,
   besides, a harmful process of Judaising would probably have set in.
   Lastly, if prophecy had remained the sole form of expression of what
   was specifically Christian, religion would have inevitably degenerated
   into a wild and unwholesome emotionalism.

   If No. 2 (a collection of Christian prophetical works side by side with
   the Old Testament) had established itself, the unfavourable
   consequences considered under No. 1 would, indeed, have been somewhat
   weakened--for the distinction between new and old would have been
   emphasised--but they would not have vanished. The historical element so
   essential to the new Faith would have remained here as weak as in No.
   1, and, because all that is essentially Christian would have remained
   confined within the forms of prophecy, the danger of degeneration into
   emotionalism would have been still to be feared. It is nevertheless
   imaginable that the sharp distinction of the new Canon from the old
   might have produced a satisfactory recognition of the independent
   status of the new Religion.

   If the development had come to a stop with No. 3 (the Old Testament and
   a collection of Sayings of the Lord like Q), the commands of Christ
   would have attained an extraordinary importance as "ius divinum."
   Standing alone and independently at the side of the Old Testament they
   would have acquired enormous force. But in that case the Universal
   Church could scarcely have come into existence, or at least would not
   have continued to exist; rather a spirit of strict ascetic moralism
   would have acquired the upper hand, and Christendom would have probably
   become a great group of ascetic communities based upon the "ius
   divinum" given by Christ. Even if this consequence had not followed, it
   is to be feared that, with the solution of the problem given in No. 3,
   the Old Testament would have still held a position that would have
   placed Christianity in danger of Judaistic influence.

   The latter danger would have been avoided if the development had
   advanced to the stage of No. 4 (the Old Testament and one Gospel or
   several) and had come to a stop there; for the authoritative history of
   the Lord wondrously born, crucified, and risen again [166] would have
   more than held its own against the Old Testament. [167] Neither would
   there have been any fear of an encroachment of Moralism in the form of
   the commands of Christ as "ius divinum"; for the Gospel of Salvation
   and of Faith would have repressed all tendency to mere moralism. And
   yet the appeal of the new order would still have been wanting in
   compelling force, because the idea of the New Covenant would not have
   been firmly seized. Moreover, if the new Canon had been confined to the
   Gospel (the Gospels), the Church in the course of her development in
   contact with the philosophic systems and religions of the Empire would
   have had no guidance as to her behaviour. This guidance was afforded by
   the "Apostolic" writings, above all by the Epistles of St Paul in spite
   of other difficulties that they presented. Without such guidance the
   Church most probably would have fallen into perplexity that might even
   have overwhelmed her. She would also have been absolutely defenceless
   against all that falsely pretended to be "Apostolic tradition," and as
   such claimed obedience.

   If the development had come to a stop with No. 5 (the Gospels and a
   varied collection of Christian writings, Apostolic and otherwise), we
   might imagine that already almost everything would have been attained
   that has been attained through the New Testament. But although in this
   case a large number of sacred books of authoritative and directive
   character stood side by side with the Gospel (Gospels), still they were
   not subjected to one uniform principle. It is true that the idea of the
   Apostolic played an important part in them, but this idea was not yet
   recognised as the sole guiding principle. Hence unsuitable and
   disturbing elements could establish themselves in the Canon, which was
   not yet closed even in idea, to say nothing of actual practice. If this
   condition had remained final, then not only would the Canon have been
   liable to continual additions of a questionable character, but there
   would have been continual uncertainty as to what was "ius divinum"; and
   the grand weapon against heresy would have lost its edge, for the idea
   of firm apostolic tradition in the form of litera scripta would have
   been wanting.

   We have already discussed how things would have stood if No. 6 (Old
   Testament, Gospel, and "Teaching of the Lord through the Apostles," or
   "Apostolic Canons") had established itself. The situation, however,
   which has become actual in the Catholic Churches--namely, that the New
   Testament with its "Apostolus," together with "Apostolic Canons," count
   as sources of the "ius divinum"--is especially suitable for the
   purposes of these Churches, because these extra-Biblical Canons bridge
   the gulf between the Bible and unwritten tradition, affording the
   latter a kind of foothold; and at the same time they make it possible
   to introduce the same gradation of prestige into the conception of what
   is canonical in the sphere of the new Covenant, as had been already
   introduced in the relation of the New Testament to the Old Testament.
   The idea of degrees of prestige--an idea which, when applied to the
   "ius divinum," is still more paradoxical than when applied to the "ius
   humanum"--is quite indispensable to the Catholic Church for her kingdom
   in which worldly and spiritual elements are so closely intermingled.
   She needs the idea even for her dogmas, indeed, if she wishes to remain
   a Church of tradition and yet to dominate the present, if she would be
   uniform and at the same time give scope to individuality, she cannot
   manage without it.

   In regard to No. 7 nothing definite can be said, because we cannot even
   imagine how things would have shaped themselves, if only a definitely
   fixed synthesis or concordance of Old Testament prophecy with the
   history of Christ, of the Apostles, and of the founding of the Church,
   had stood as the new Canon side by side with the Old Testament.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [156] The Shepherd of Hermas quotes only one sacred work, the
   Revelation of Eldad and Modad, a work that is quite unknown to us.

   [157] According to the Apocalypse, one is to hear "what the Spirit
   saith" (i.e. caused to be written). This is an entirely new form, which
   could very well give the fundamental principle of a new canon side by
   side with the Old Testament.

   [158] In an undercurrent in the Church--even into the Middle Ages--"the
   Lord" still continued to be essentially represented by His Sayings and
   Parables, and lived especially in the Sermon on the Mount and the
   "Evangelical Counsels."

   [159] What was needed was the collective testimony of the Apostles as a
   defence against heresy. But a no less decisive consideration was the
   fact that the Pauline Epistles, because of their wide circulation and
   their own weight, had become indispensable.

   [160] The same condition is also presupposed by the formula used once
   by Tertullian in one of his earlier writings (De Præsc., 40):
   "Instrumenta divinarum rerum et sanctorum Christianorum." I conjecture
   that this formula was current in Carthage immediately before the time
   of Tertullian, and that he referred to it once only as it were by
   accident. Still more important in this connection is the testimony that
   the collection of Pauline Epistles stood as a completely separate
   entity beside the Holy Scriptures (Mart. Scil., cf. also the Fragments
   of Caius).

   [161] An example is afforded even by the Muratorian Fragment in the
   strange addition of the "Sapientia," and by the Catalogus Claramontanus
   in the addition of the Acta Pauli.

   [162] In so far as in later times the decisions of the Great Councils
   were proclaimed to be canonical, and were attached to the New
   Testament, this may be interpreted as an instance of the persistence of
   the idea that is expressed in No. 5, namely that the second half of the
   new collection is not closed but is still capable of additions of
   snored and authoritative character.

   [163] If the Didache, or the idea which led to it, had firmly
   established itself, it would have entirely prevented the formation of
   the Apostolus, i.e. of the second part of the New Testament. We should
   have then received a canonical litera scripta in three divisions: (1)
   The Old Testament; (2) The Gospel (or the Gospels); (3) The teaching of
   the Lord through the Apostles. This third division would not have
   remained stable (as is shown in the actual history of these writings),
   but would have been subject to continual alteration and transformation
   in accordance with the continuous development of the Church; for in
   essence it is nothing else than codified Tradition. In fact the
   Catholic Churches still possess this third division, yet for the
   greater part in fluid and uncodified form. In the watchword "Scripture
   (Old Testament and New Testament) and Tradition" it has still a life of
   fundamental importance in these Churches.

   [164] Some beginnings on the line of such a collection must have been
   made as is indicated by the works just mentioned which presuppose, it
   seems to me, the existence of collections of Messianic passages from
   the Old Testament. Already the speeches in the first part of the Acts
   give promise of the arrival of such a collection. Perhaps the Jews
   already possessed something of the kind. In the "Testimonies" of
   Cyprian, passages from the Old Testament and New Testament are
   collected together for every dogmatic "locus." As the Testimonies
   enjoyed for a time a semi-canonical prestige, it follows that the
   synthesis of passages was also regarded as semi-canonical. Vide on the
   whole question the comprehensive and trustworthy work of von
   Ungern-Sternberg: Die Traditionelle Neutestamentlichen Schriftbeweis
   "De Christo" und "De Evangelio" in der alten Kirche bis zur Zeit Euseb.
   von Cäsarea (1913), and my critique in the Preuss. Jahrbuch, 1913,
   July, S. 119 ff. Cf. also Weidel, "Studien über den Einfluss des
   Weissagungsbeweises auf die evang. Geschichte" (Theol. Stud. u. Krit.,
   1910, S. 83 ff., 163 ff.). Ungern-Sternberg has proved that the
   material which was employed for Scripture proofs was handed down in a
   definite though elastic form and arrangement. On pages 258 ff. the aim,
   significance, and use of this material are set forth in eighteen short
   paragraphs. Though this synthesis did not exist in fixed written form,
   it exercised an influence similar to that of a written work (S. 294
   ff.).

   [165] The New Testament has preserved to a certain extent the letter of
   the Old Testament (in its historical significance), a service of no
   small value.

   [166] Tertullian calls this history "Originalia instrumenta Christi"
   (De Carne, 2).

   [167] "Originale instrumentum Moysei" (Tert., Adv. Hermog., 19).

APPENDIX III

   The Beginnings of the Conception of an Instrumentum Novissimum; the
   Hope for the Evangelium Aeternum; the Public Lection, and the
   quasi-Canonical Recognition, of the Stories of the Martyrs in the
   Church.

   In the first section of his Kanonsgeschichte (Bd. i., S. 3-22) Zahn has
   tried to show that when Montanism arose in Phrygia the New Testament
   was already in existence; that the Montanists, however, added to it a
   third Canon in which a kind of Gospel (the Logia of the Paraclete),
   analogies to the Pauline Epistles, and an apocalypse were to be found.
   Zahn's thesis, in spite of all the learning that has been lavished upon
   it, is untenable in this form--especially in what concerns the contents
   of this "Scriptura novissima"--as I have shown in my work, "Das
   Neutestament um d. J. 200" (1889). It is, however, quite true that the
   Montanists very soon set up a collection of the Sayings of the
   Paraclete (spoken by Montanus, Maximilla, and Priscilla) and assigned
   to it a status of the highest honour corresponding to the final
   character of the mission of the Paraclete. Also the conception that the
   Paraclete stands to the revelation given in Christ and His Apostles as
   Moses stands to Abraham is earlier than Tertullian, and belongs to
   earlier Phrygian Montanism; in both cases Grace precedes and is
   followed after a certain period by the giving of a Law. Seeing,
   however, that the Revelation in Christ and His Apostles was for the
   Church represented in a written work, was "Scripture," it became a
   problem for Montanist Catholics like Tertullian what status they were
   now to assign to the prophecy of the Paraclete. In his later treatises
   Tertullian, in controversy with heretics and psychics, is accustomed
   always first to argue from the Old Testament and New Testament as
   "Scripture," and then to appeal to an oracle of the Paraclete as an
   instance of the clearest and most conclusive character; but he neither
   treats nor quotes the collection of oracles as "Scriptura." He
   therefore--in spite of his reverence for the sayings of the Paraclete,
   and although they were embodied in a collection--felt himself compelled
   to refrain from formally adding them to the "Scriptura." It was not
   expedient to create a "third" Testament; for then the importance of the
   first coming of Christ would have been depreciated in a fashion that
   would have offended Tertullian's Christian conscience (the Paraclete
   belongs to Christ and is sent by Him). But even the natural solution,
   the adding of the new collection as a second part to the New Testament
   would have had its own great difficulties; seeing that the New
   Testament consisted already of two divisions, and that the collection
   of oracles could neither be included in the Apostolus nor could be
   treated as a third part of the New Testament (in the former case it
   would have lost something of its own peculiar significance, even in the
   latter case this would have been obscured). Accordingly Tertullian
   seems to have been satisfied with treating the oracles of the
   Paraclete, taken as separate sayings, as in a formless and indefinite
   way equal to or even superior to Holy Scripture.

   And yet he was not quite satisfied. The collection of oracles could not
   be produced as "Testamentum"--for there were only two Covenants and two
   Testaments, the old and the new--yet the collection of oracles belongs
   to the "Instrumentum ecclesiæ." The Old Testament and the New Testament
   are the "instrumenta pristina" (De Monog., 4; De Resurr., 63), [168]
   but "noster auctor" (the Paraclete) has his "instrumenta" and the
   Church ought to acknowledge them. And these "instrumenta" include not
   only the oracles in which the Christian Law has now first come to
   clearer expression, but also the famous deeds of the faithful who have
   submitted to the direction of the Paraclete, the visions they have
   received, and the martyrdoms they have endured through His power. The
   commands of Christ and of the Apostles do not yet in every sense stand
   on the topmost heights--of this Tertullian had no doubt--because they
   are still affected by a certain spirit of accommodation, and therefore
   the deeds of Christians before the time of the Paraclete were as a rule
   infected by a certain imperfection; but now through the Paraclete the
   Church has arrived at the time of perfection. All that had made this
   time what it was, all that this time had brought forth, must ever be
   shown forth to the Church in public lection and must be received into
   her "instrumentum."

   This is the position that Tertullian takes up in the preface to the
   Acta Perpet. et Felic., which has been already referred to (p. 28, note
   2): "Si vetera fidei exempla in literis sunt digesta, ut lectione eorum
   et deus honoretur et homo confortetur--cur non et nova documenta æque
   utrique causæ convenientia et digerantur? . . . Viderint qui unam
   virtutem spiritus unius sancti pro ætatibus indicent temporum, cum
   maiora reputanda sunt novitiora quæque ut novissimiora secundum
   exuperationem gratiæ in ultima sæculi spatia decretam (here follows the
   passage from Joel). itaque et nos qui sicut prophetias ita et visiones
   novas pariter repromissas et agnoscimus et honoramus, ceterasque
   virtutes spiritus sancti ad instrumentum ecclesiæ deputatas necessario
   et digerimus et ad gloriam dei lectione celebramus . . . et nos itaque
   quod audivimus et contractavimus, annuntiamus et vobis."

   Just as, at the time when there was no New Testament in the strict
   sense of the word, the Pauline Epistles were added to the Holy
   Scriptures consisting of the Old Testament and the Gospels, and thus
   found their place in the "Instrumentum ecclesiæ," so now Tertullian
   would have the Church accept the oracles of the Paraclete and the
   records of the spiritual heroes of the new age into her
   Instrumentum--not as an addition to the New Testament, but as a
   fundamental authority standing side by side with it. The considerations
   which here influenced Tertullian were by no means wholly and
   specifically Montanist: I have indeed shown in my article, "Das
   ursprüngliche Motiv der Abfassung von Märtyrer- und Heilungsakten in
   der Kirche," how greatly the Church also was interested in the
   possession of documents testifying to the present influence of the Holy
   Spirit. In the Church this interest was satisfied by proving that the
   same spirit and the same power that once wrought in the Apostolic Age
   were still at work: nothing to the detriment of the prestige of the New
   Testament could ever arise from this. On the other hand, there is no
   doubt that Tertullian thought that the new elements which were to be
   added to the "Instrumentum ecclesiæ" (not to either of the Testaments)
   ought to have in a certain sense superior prestige--the oracles of the
   Paraclete, because they for the first time contained the Christian Law
   sine ambiguitatibus and absolutely apart from any tendency to
   accommodation; the Acts of the Martyrs, like that of Perpetua, because
   by this heroic story, that had not its peer up to that time in Africa,
   Tertullian is convinced that Christians of the present day, of the time
   of the Paraclete, if they followed Perpetua, would transcend the
   Christians pristinorum temporum and would at last realise genuine
   Christianity. [169]

   Strange indeed! The New Testament was scarcely created, at all events
   was not yet completed, when the most eminent Christian of the West
   already perceived its defects! The Canon which was intended to show,
   and by its very existence to render tolerable the imperfection and the
   "shadow" of the Old Testament is itself also clouded with a "shadow"
   and is not yet perfection! And this because it contains ambiguities and
   is governed by a tendency to accommodation, but above all because it
   has not been able to show as its credentials that the people of God now
   stands under laws so unambiguous as to exclude all doubt and weakness.
   On the contrary it is evident that controversy upon controversy emerges
   in the Christian life, and that every weakness and laxity could cloak
   themselves with texts from the New Testament--often indeed with
   unreason, but often also unfortunately with good reason! And thus under
   the influence of the New Testament Christianity so far had arrived at
   only an imperfect development! Hence there was need of a new Scripture
   and this was actually in existence: it comprised on the one hand the
   directions of the Paraclete, and on the other hand documents like the
   Acts of Perpetua. The Paraclete had now led Christians "into all the
   Truth," and has told them "what they could not bear before"; and
   evident tokens are already present of the enthusiasm of the perfect
   life that He has now enkindled.

   "Pristinæ scripturæ" (Old Testament and New Testament)--"prophetia nova
   cum documentis martyrum": this arrangement of authorities alone
   answered to what was now at work. A part of Christendom, including the
   greatest Western theologian, already saw a "Shadow" upon the new-born
   New Testament, and looked for an Instrumentum Novissimum--indeed
   fancied that they already possessed it! The fancy redounded to their
   honour; for it was the expression of their absolute moral earnestness
   and sincerity even in the face of the Scripture of the New Testament.

   But still more strange! About the same time the most eminent theologian
   of the East, the obedient son of the Scriptures and their greatest
   champion and exponent, also notes a "shadow" on the New Testament. It
   is true that for him this work, which he regards as forming a literary
   unity with the Old Testament (Pasa he theopneustos graphe hen biblion
   estin), [170] is exalted above all praise and is the deepest fount of
   the mysteries of God, yet he cannot but note that it is not in every
   sense final. In passages like 1 Cor. xiii. 9 f.; 2 Cor. xii. 4; St John
   xx. 25; Rev. x. 4, Scripture itself points beyond itself, thus there is
   still a promise of an "Everlasting Gospel" for the Spiritual Church.
   Origen, in his works, often deals with this "Everlasting Gospel" (Rev.
   xiv. 6), contrasted with which the Gospel that we possess belongs to
   the aistheta and temporalia. In De Princip., iv. 13 (25), he writes:

   "Sicut in Deuteronomio evidentior et manifestior legisdatio declaratur
   quam in his, quæ primo scripta sunt, ita et ab eo adventu salvatoris
   quem in humilitate conplevit, cum formam servi suscepit, clarior ille
   et gloriosior secundus in gloria patris eius indicetur adventus, et in
   illo forma Deuteronomii conpleatur, cum in regno cælorum sancti omnes
   æterni illius evangelii legibus vivent, et sicut nunc adveniens legem
   replevit eam, quæ umbram habet futurorum bonorum, ita et per illum
   gloriosum adventum inplebitur et ad perfectum perducetur huius adventus
   umbra. ita enim dixit propheta de eo (Threni 4, 20): Spiritus vultus
   nostri Christus dominus, cuius diximus quia in umbra eius vivemus in
   gentibus,' cum scil. ab evangelio temporali dignius omnes sanctos ad
   æternum evangelium transferat, secundum quod Joannes in Apocalypsi de
   æterno evangelio designavit." [171] The continuation is suppressed by
   Rufinus, but it is preserved by Jerome and Justinian. [172] In Joh. I.
   7 (S. 12 Preuschen) we read: Touto eidenai echren, hoti hosper esti
   "nomos skian" periechon "ton mellonton agathon" hupo tou kata aletheian
   katangellomenou nomou deloumenon, houto kai euangelion skian musterion
   Christou didaskei to nomizomenon hupo panton ton entunchanonton
   noeisthai. ho de phesin Ioannes "euangelion aionion," oikeios an
   lechthesomenon pneumatikon, saphos paristesi tois noousin "ta panta
   enopion" peri autou tou huiou tou theou kai ta paristamena musteria
   hupo ton logon autou ta te pragmata, hon ainigmata esan hai praxeis
   autou [173] (cf. i. 14, p. 18).

   In Rom. I. 4 (T. vi. p. 21 Lommatzsch) Origen's note on Rom. i. 2, 3,
   runs: "Utrum simpliciter accipi debeat evangelium per scripturas
   propheticas a deo repromissum, an ad distinctionem alterius evangelii,
   quod æternum dicit Joannes in Apocalypsi, quod tunc revelandum est, cum
   umbra transierit et veritas venerit et cum mors fuerit absorpta et
   æternitas restituta, considerato etiam tu qui legis! cui æterno
   evangelio convenire videbuntur etiam illi æterni anni, de quibus
   propheta dicit: Et annos æternos in mente habui,' eique adiungi potest
   et ille liber vitæ in quo sanctorum nomina scripta dicuntur, sed et
   illi libri qui apud Danielem, cum iudicium consedisset, aperti
   sunt. . . . Si ergo cum apparuit nobis hominibus, non sine evangelio
   apparuit, consequentia videtur ostendere, quod etiam angelico ordini
   non sine evangelio apparuerit, illo fortassis, quod æternum evangelium
   a Joanne memoratum supra edocuimus."

   The idea of a distinct "Everlasting Gospel" was indeed suggested to
   Origen by the passage in Revelation; but it is no mere devotion to the
   text of the Bible that is here at work in him. Rather he looks for an
   Everlasting Gospel (1) because it is absolutely clear to him that
   Christ must necessarily still have a great work to perform for the
   cosmic powers (the daemons) and that this will stand in the
   "Everlasting Gospel"; [174] (2) because the Gospel that we possess
   refers to this sphere of Time, wherein nothing quite perfect can come
   to expression and everything must be clouded by the shadow of the
   transitory, [175] hence we are to look for a final Gospel which will
   bear the same relation to the New Testament as this to the Old
   Testament; (3) because he, like Tertullian both in feeling and thought,
   [176] was forced to confess with sorrow that Christians did not yet
   live a truly moral life, and that it was not possible in this world so
   to live, [177] therefore a time must come "quo sancti omnes æterni
   illius evangelii legibus vivent." The laws of our Gospel are not yet
   quite perfect, and, therefore, the life of Christians is not yet quite
   perfect.

   According to Tertullian the Montanist, there is an "Instrumentum
   Novissimum" transcending the New Testament and containing the final
   revelation for the Christian life (given by the Paraclete), and also
   containing records that testify to the actual existence of the perfect
   life (Acta Perpet.); in this "Instrumentum" the shadow which still lies
   on the New Testament has vanished away. According to Origen there is
   for Christians the expectation of the "Everlasting Gospel"--but only
   after their departure from this realm of Time--in which the shadow of
   the New Testament is removed, and through which the perfect life will
   first become possible. In this point the Church has not allowed either
   Tertullian or Origen to prevail; yet she, led by Tertullian's second
   impulse, but at the same time correcting it, at once began to collect
   histories of the martyrs and to read them in the public services side
   by side with Holy Scripture. Through this practice of public lection
   they acquired a quasi-canonical prestige. Any thought of endangering
   the authority of Holy Scripture was quite remote from this practice,
   yet it strengthened in the Church the consciousness that the same
   spirit that had created the two Testaments was still to-day working
   powerfully in the Church. "Stupebamus audientes tam recenti memoria et
   prope nostris temporibus testatissima mirabilia tua in fide recta et
   catholica ecclesia" (August., Confess., viii. 6, 14, in reference to
   the Vita Antonii)--this was the feeling of Catholic Christians also in
   the third century when they read stories of the martyrs. These, too,
   were to serve as "Canon" for the practice of the Christian Life.
   "Instrumentum novissimum"--"Evangelium æternum"--"Historiæ Canonicæ
   Martyrum": more than a century must pass before the Christian came that
   wrote down the phrase so simple and yet so decisive for the deeper
   history of Christendom, wrote down, as if it were self-evident: "Homo
   fide, spe, et caritate subnixus eaque inconcusse retinens non indiget
   scripturis nisi ad alios instruendos" (August., De Doctr. Christ., i.
   39 [43]). This was in truth the message of the Paraclete, and the
   Everlasting Gospel!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [168] In De Monog., 4, the expression "evolvamus communia instrumenta
   scripturarum pristinarum" does not refer only to the Old Testament (the
   plural itself, and also what follows, render this improbable), but to
   both Testaments in distinction from the word of the Paraclete active in
   the present. The same is true of De Resurr., 63: "Quia hæreses esse
   oportuerat, hac autem sine aliquibus occasionibus scripturarum audere
   non poterant, idcirco pristina instrumenta quasdam materias illis
   videntur subministrasse . . . sed . . . iam spiritus sanctus omnes
   retro ambiguitates et quas volunt parabolas aperta atque perspicua
   totius sacramenti prædicatione discussit per novam prophetiam de
   paracleto inundantem."

   [169] The importance of the Acta Perpetuæ--not only according to the
   view of Tertullian, but also for the African Church--can scarcely be
   exaggerated. The life of Cyprian was written by Pontius mainly to put
   Cyprian in the place of Perpetua (vide Texte u. Unters., Bd. 39, 3),
   and Augustine finds it still necessary to write (De Anima et eius
   orig., i. 12; iii. 12): "De fratre autem sanctæ Perpetuæ Dinocrite nec
   scriptura ipsa canonica est nec illa sic scripsit, vel quicumque illud
   scripsit, ut illum puerum sine baptismo diceret fuisse defunctum"; and:
   "Exempla quae te fallunt vel de latrone qui dominum est confessus in
   cruce vel de fratre sanctæ Perpetuæ Dinocrate, nihil tibi ad huius
   erroris sententiam suffragantur . . . ipsa lectio (scil., Acta Perpet.)
   non est in eo canone scripturarum, unde in huiusmodi quæstionibus
   testimonia proferenda sunt." Vincentius Victor, against whom Augustine
   is here writing, had thus appealed to the Acta Perpetuæ together with
   the Gospel of St Luke as authorities for his doctrine. Augustine
   reminds him that the Acta Perpet. was not in the Canon, but in the
   second passage he expresses himself in such a way that we recognise
   that he counted these Acts to belong to the "Instrumentum
   ecclesiasticum" in the wider sense; for he testifies that a certain
   canonicity could not be denied to them. This is an answer to Ehrhard's
   objections (Byzantin. Ztschr., Bd. 19, 3 [1910], S. 610 ff.) against my
   above-mentioned treatise concerning the Acts of the Martyrs. Ehrhard
   rejects the idea that these Acts form in a certain sense a supplement
   to the New Testament.

   [170] (All inspired Scripture is one Book.) Prom the point of view of
   the history of the Canon there is scarcely any difference between
   Origen's and Tertullian's conception of the New Testament (apart from
   the extent of the Canon). Origen, like Tertullian, emphasises the
   Apostolic character of the New Testament (Prophets and Apostles = Old
   Testament and New Testament), subjects interpretation to the Apostolic
   Rule of Faith (De Princip. iv. 2. 2: ho kanon tes Iesou Christou kata
   diadochen ton apostolon ouraniou ekklesias and upholds a distinction in
   prestige between the Old Testament and the New Testament as well as the
   thesis that the Divine character of the Old Testament can only be
   proved by means of the New Testament.

   [171] Hieron., Ep. ad. Avit. 12: "(Origenes) dixit iuxta Joannis
   Apocalypsin Evangelium sempiternum,' i.e. futurum in cælis, tantum
   præcedere hoc nostrum evangelium quantum Christi prædicatio legis
   veteris sacramenta. . . ." Jerome's literal translation is as follows:
   "Sicut enim per umbram (veritatem' can scarcely be right) evangelii
   umbram legis implevit, sic, quia omnis lex exemplum et umbra' est
   cerimoniarum cælestium, diligentius requirendum, utrum recte
   intellegamus legem quoque cælestem at cerimonias superni cultus
   plenitudinem non habere, sed indigere evangelii veritate, quod in
   Joannis Apocalypsi Evangelium' legimus Sempiternum,' ad comparationem
   videlicet huius nostri Evangelii, quod teanporale est el in transituro
   mundo ac sæculo prædicatum."

   [172] Vide Koetschaus' Edition, p. 344.

   [173] (This we must know: That just as the Law contains a "shadow of
   the good things to come" that are made clear by the Law when it is
   preached according to truth, so also the Gospel--the ordinary gospel as
   it is understood by ordinary people--teaches a shadow of the mysteries
   of Christ. But what John calls the "Everlasting Gospel," which should
   properly be called the Spiritual Gospel, clearly delivers to those who
   have understanding "all things face to face" concerning the Son of God
   Himself, both the mysteries delivered by His words and the ineffable
   acts of which His actions were mystic symbols.)

   [174] According to the testimony of Jerome and Justinian this argument
   appeared in the passage which Rufinus suppressed in his translation.
   Vide also the note just given on the passage from Romans.

   [175] If Origen could have used modern terminology he would have been
   forced to say here and in connection with many other parts of his
   system: Even the New Testament is something that is relative. This
   truly great theologian needs only to be freed from the "scientific"
   presuppositions of his times, to which he was as a matter of course
   bound, to appear, both in his characteristic broadness of mind as well
   as in the many sidedness of his knowledge, a critical and constructive
   genius of the first rank.

   [176] Very many passages in his homilies and commentaries prove this.

   [177] The latter belief is foreign to Tertullian.

APPENDIX IV

The Use of the New Testament in the Carthaginian (and Roman) Church at the Time
of Tertullian

   In the works of Tertullian there lies a great body of material from
   which one may form a judgment as to the use and valuation of the New
   Testament in the Carthaginian Church. I do not mean the passages in
   which Tertullian himself makes use of the New Testament, but those
   passages in which he reports instances where passages from the New
   Testament were employed as proof-texts against himself by his
   adversaries the "Lax" or, in his later writings, the "Psychics." The
   "Lax" or the "Psychics," however, formed the majority of the Church,
   and had probably the body of clergy behind them, so that we thus
   actually learn the general attitude of the Church towards the New
   Testament. [178] The writings of Tertullian form our sole authority for
   such information concerning that special period, and herein, too, they
   have no small value for us. If we did not possess them it would have
   been at least doubtful whether the attitude of the theological writers
   towards the New Testament was not in advance of the rest of the Church,
   and that a quite different view prevailed in the communities. That
   Tertullian really had the majority of the community against him is
   clearly shown by De Virg. Vel., i., among other passages, where
   Tertullian confesses in the first sentence: "Proprium iam negotium
   passus meæ opinionis," i.e. I am again left in a minority and must go
   on fighting.

   In collecting the following passages I have used all the works of
   Tertullian, so far as they contain appropriate material, with the
   exception of those written against heretics: hence De Præsc. and
   Scorpiace have been neglected. These works also contain, it is true,
   objections and deductions made by the community, [179] but they do not
   allow of being clearly distinguished from the objections and deductions
   made by heretics.

   The first thing to be stated is that the community already treat the
   New Testament just in the same way as Tertullian himself, that is, they
   have the same ideas about the book and therefore apply the same method
   of interpretation to, and make the same demands upon the book as he.
   Thus they required that for each regulation in Christian Discipline a
   text of Scripture must be in existence [180] --this is, in truth,
   Tertullian's own opinion, but when he is in a difficulty he renounces
   it, and in his later works he falls back upon the Paraclete--thus the
   silence of Scripture upon any point is most significant, for instance:
   The Apostles cannot have been baptised, [181] because the Scripture
   says nothing about it; while Scripture condemns unchastity it does not
   deny the possibility of forgiveness, therefore we must accept the
   possibility, [182] etc. Again, they agree as to the right of unlimited
   combination of passages of Scripture: Because in Gal. i. 16, "Flesh and
   Blood" can be referred to Judaism, so also the "Flesh and Blood" of 1
   Cor. xv. 50 can mean Judaism, and the latter passage is therefore to be
   interpreted: "Judaism cannot inherit the kingdom of God"! [183]
   Further, it is allowable to take one's stand upon one single text and
   from this standpoint to regard all others as if they did not exist, or,
   in other words, to twist them into harmony. This practice drives
   Tertullian to desperation (vide, e.g., De Pud., 16: "Sed est hoc
   solemne perversis et idiotis hæreticis, iam et psychicis universis,
   alicuius capituli ancipitis occasione adversus exercitum sententiarum
   instrumenti totius [of the whole Bible] armari"); but how often had he
   done the same thing!

   The following passages of the New Testament are alleged by the
   community against Tertullian:

   St Matt. ii. 1 ff. (De Idol., 9).--Magi appear in the New Testament and
   are not blamed as such, hence Magic and Astrology are not forbidden to
   Christians.

   St Matt. v. 25 (De Fuga, 13).--From the words: isthi eunoon to
   antidiko, it can be concluded that in Persecution one may, indeed is
   commanded to, come to terms with the adversary.

   St Matt. v. 40 (De Fuga, 13).--From the words: "From him who takes thy
   coat keep not back thy cloak also," one may deduce that in times of
   Persecution one is allowed to mollify the oppressor by yielding to him.

   St Matt. v. 42 (De Fuga, 13).--From the words: "Give to him that asketh
   thee," it can be concluded that one may save oneself from the
   persecutor by paying him what he asks.

   St Matt. vi. 14 (De Pud., 2).--The general direction, "Forgive," must
   be regarded as unlimited.

   St Matt. vii. 1 (De Pud., 2).--From the command, "Judge not," follows
   the duty of unlimited forgiveness.

   St Matt. ix. 15 (De Jeiun., 2).--It follows from this verse that one
   ought to fast only at the Passion season ("when the Bridegroom is taken
   away").

   St Matt. x. 23 (De Cor., 1; De Fuga, 1, 6, 9, etc.).--The Christian
   may, indeed ought to, flee at the time of Persecution ("Flee from one
   city to another").

   St Matt. xi. 13 (De Jeiun., 11).--The ordinances concerning fasting are
   abolished because the Law and the Prophets only lasted until John.

   St Matt. xi. 19 (De Jeiun., 15).--Seeing that Jesus is pictured as
   esthion kai pinon, it is unworthy of a Christian to burden himself with
   food restrictions.

   St Matt. xvi. 18 f. (De Pud., 21).--The bishop of Rome has the right to
   regard the promise to St Peter as holding good for himself.

   St Matt. xix. 14 (De Bapt., 18).--Seeing that Jesus called the children
   to Himself, one may, indeed ought also to baptise them.

   St Matt. xxii. 21 (De Idol., 15; De Fuga, 12).--The text; "Render to
   Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's" may, and ought to determine the
   behaviour of the Christian in persecutions.

   St Matt. xxvii. 19 (De Cor., 9).--Since Jesus wore a crown of thorns,
   the wearing of garlands ought not to be forbidden to Christians.

   St Luke i. 28 (De Virg. Vel., 6).--Mary is here reckoned among women
   because she was betrothed, not simply as a female ("Blessed art thou
   among women").

   St Luke iii. 14 (De Idol., 19).--Seeing that John exhorts the soldiers,
   but does not denounce the soldier's profession, therefore the
   profession of a soldier is permissible to a Christian.

   St Luke iv. 29 (De Fuga, 8).--From this and similar passages it is to
   be deduced that, as Jesus withdrew Himself from His persecutors, so
   also may Christians.

   St Luke vi. 30 (De Bapt., 18).--From the general instruction: "Give to
   everyone that asks thee," it follows that one must give Baptism to
   everyone that asks for it (thus Baptism ought not to be delayed).

   St Luke vii. 36 ff. (De Pud., 11).--From the story of the woman who was
   a sinner, it follows that forgiveness must be granted to the Christian
   even if he has committed deadly sin (sins against chastity).

   St Luke xv. (De Pud., 7, 8, 10).--By interpretation of the several
   traits in the three parables of the Lost Sheep, the Lost Piece of
   Money, and the Prodigal Son, it can be shown that these refer only to
   the Christian that has sinned (and not to the heathen), and that
   therefore forgiveness must be imparted even to one who commits deadly
   sin. [184]

   St Luke xvi. 9 (De Fuga, 13).--From the injunction to make to oneself
   friends by means of Mammon, it follows that one may use bribes at the
   time of persecution.

   St John iv. 2 (De Bapt., 11).--As Jesus did not Himself baptise, it
   follows that baptism is not absolutely necessary.

   St John iv. 5 ff. (De Pud., 11).--The story of the Samaritan Woman
   proves that the Church ought to forgive even the grossest sins.

   Acts iii. 1 (De Jeiun., 2, 10).--Because Peter went up into the Temple
   to pray at the ninth hour, this practice should be copied by the
   Church.

   Acts viii. 36 (De Bapt., 18).--From the so speedy Baptism of the
   Eunuch, one must deduce that it is right and a duty not to delay
   Baptism.

   Acts x. 1 f. (De Idol., 19).--The centurion was converted, therefore
   the profession of soldier is permissible for Christians.

   Acts xv. 19 (De Jeiun., 2).--The Apostles at the Council did not wish
   to lay any heavy yoke upon Christians, therefore the ordinances of the
   Montanists concerning fasting are out of place.

   Rom. ii. 24 (De Idol., 14; De Cultu, ii. 11).--The name of God ought
   not to be blasphemed, therefore Christians, in order to give no offence
   to the heathen, should comply with the customs of heathen festivals and
   homes, or at least should not show open displeasure with what the
   heathen do.

   Rom. xii. 15 (De Idol., 13).--One must rejoice with those that rejoice,
   therefore the Christian may join in the public festivals.

   Rom. xiii. 7 (De Idol., 13).--As it says: apodote pasin tas opheilas,
   the Christian may, and ought to, pay the usual dues on the days
   appointed by public custom.

   Rom. xiv. 4 (De Pud., 2).--This verse stands in the following passage
   which Tertullian controverts "God is good, indeed is the supremely
   good, pitiful, merciful, rich in mercy, which He prefers to all
   sacrifice; He would rather the conversion than the death of the sinner;
   He offers salvation to all men, and especially to those that believe.
   Therefore, we the children of God must also be pitiful and placable,
   forgiving one another as Christ also has forgiven us, judging not that
   we be not judged. For to his own lord each stands and falls. Who art
   thou that thou judgest another man's servant? Forgive and thou shalt he
   forgiven."

   Rom. xiv. 17 (De Jeiun., 15).--The Kingdom of God is not eating and
   drinking, therefore the ascetic rules of the Montanists concerning food
   are in fault.

   Rom. xv. 1 (De Fuga, 9).--From the injunction "to bear with the weak,"
   it follows that one ought to be gentle with Christians who flee at time
   of persecution.

   1 Cor. i. 17 (De Bapt., 14).--Paul says that Christ had not sent him to
   baptise, therefore one can even omit Baptism.

   1 Cor. v. 10 (De Idol., 14, 24).--Paul does not desire that a man
   should go out of the world, and does not forbid intercourse with
   heathen, therefore a Christian may frequent heathen meetings,
   festivals, etc.

   1 Cor. vi. 18 (De Pud., 16).--Paul says that the fornicator sins eis to
   idion soma, therefore he does not sin eis ton theon.

   1 Cor. vii. (De Idol., 5; Ad Uxor., i. 3; ii. 1 f.; De Exhort., 3, 4;
   De Pud., 1, 16; De Monog., 3, 11).--This chapter is exploited to prove
   (1) the unrestricted right to marriage, (2) the right of second
   marriage, and (3) of marriage with heathen, etc.

   1 Cor. vii. 20 (De Idol., 5).--The injunction that each should abide in
   his klesis justifies every Christian in abiding in his trade, even if
   it brings him into touch with idolatrous worship.

   1 Cor. viii. 8 (De Jeiun., 15).--What Paul here says about food and
   eating puts Montanist asceticism in the wrong.

   1 Cor. ix. 22 (De Idol., 14).--"I am become all things to all men" can
   and ought to serve as a maxim of broadmindedness for the Christian in
   his converse with heathen.

   1 Cor. ix. 24 (De Spect., 18).--One may go to the games in the
   "Stadium," seeing that the "Stadium" is mentioned in the Bible. [185]

   1 Cor. x. 25 (De Jeiun., 15).--One may eat anything that is sold at the
   shambles; one must deduce all the consequences of this permission, and
   these are straight against Montanist asceticism.

   1 Cor. x. 33 (De Idol., 14).--The Apostle's saying, panta pasin aresko,
   ought to lead the Christian to the greatest accommodation in converse
   with heathen.

   1 Cor. xi. 5 (De Orat., 21 f.; De Virg. Vel., 4).--As in this passage
   women and not virgins are spoken of, there is no need for the latter to
   be veiled.

   2 Cor. ii. 5-11 (De Pud., 13-17).--Seeing that here forgiveness is
   granted to an incestuous man, the Church must treat fornicators and
   adulterers in the same way.

   2 Cor. xii. 7 (De Pud., 13).--The fact that the messenger of Satan did
   not even spare Paul shows that deliverance into his power cannot mean
   eternal damnation.

   Gal. iv. 10 (De Jeiun., 14).--The Christian that observes special days
   as festivals, as do the Montanists, falls under the condemnation of the
   Apostle.

   Ephes. iv. 27 (De Fuga, 9).--The warning: me didote topon to diabolo is
   neglected if one simply faces the devil when he is active in
   persecution; one must rather flee from him.

   Ephes. v. 16 (De Fuga, 9).--The injunction: "Redeem the time because
   the days are evil," refers to right conduct in persecution, i.e. one
   must flee, one must bribe, etc.

   1 Thess. iv. 11 (De Idol., 5).--The command to work with one's hands
   justifies every Christian who remains in his trade, even if thereby he
   cannot avoid coming into touch with idolatrous worship.

   1 Tim. i. 15 f. (De Pud., 18).--The saying: "Christ is come to save
   sinners," obliges the Church to limitless forgiveness.

   1 Tim. i. 20 (De Pud., 18).--Hymenaeus and Alexander are delivered to
   Satan hina paideuthosin, thus deliverance to Satan does not always mean
   damnation.

   1 Tim. iii. 2 (De Monog., 12).--Monogamy is only demanded of a bishop,
   therefore other Christians can marry again.

   1 Tim. iv. 3 (De Jeiun., 15).--The description of heretics as those who
   "refrain from meats" applies to the Montanists.

   1 Tim. v. 11-15 (De Monog., 18).--The advice of the Apostle that the
   young widows should marry again hits the Montanists.

   Tit. i. 15 (De Cor., 10).--"To the pure all things are pure"--thus one
   need not be over-anxious about avoiding what belongs to idols.

   1 John i. 7-10; ii. 1 (De Pud., 19).--From these passages it follows
   that even the Christian cannot avoid sin, and that the forgiveness of
   God through Christ is boundless (katharizei hemas apo pasis adikias).
   Christ is the advocate and mediator in regard to all sins.

   Rev. ii. 20-22 (De Pud., 19).--From what is said about Jezabel we may
   conclude that sins of whoredom admit the possibility of repentance and
   forgiveness.

   Hermas Vis. v. (De Orat., 16).--Hermas sat down after he had ended his
   prayer, hence Christians also should sit down after prayer.

   Hermas Mand. iv. 3, 4 (De Pud., 10).--These passages prove the
   possibility of a second repentance and the right to marry again. [186]

   Acta Pauli (De Bapt., 17).--The example of Thecla authorises women to
   administer Baptism.

   These instances of interpretation on the part of the community have
   been collected from fourteen treatises, and though a few may have been
   invented by Tertullian, the great majority of them are "genuine." They
   prove:

   1. That the New Testament, in same compass in which Tertullian knew and
   used it, lay before his opponents in the Church, i.e. the majority of
   its members; [187]

   2. That their valuation of the book, the principles of interpretation
   they employed, etc., were exactly the same as those of Tertullian,
   [188] however much they differed from him in the employment of those
   principles in particular cases. The New Testament stands for them as a
   Canon side by side with and of equal dignity with the Old Testament; it
   contains as a divine fountain of justice ("Instrumentum divinum") laws
   of the Christian life that are absolutely valid, thus it contains the
   "ius divinum." At the same time his opponents, just like Tertullian
   himself, recognise a distinction in degree between the two Testaments
   to the advantage of the New ("The Law and the Prophets are until
   John"); and the grand conception "Evangelium expunctor totius retro
   vetustatis" (Tert., De Orat., 1) is never disputed, rather it is
   confirmed by them;

   3. That, though the general impression that we receive from these
   expositions is unfavourable, it is obvious, nevertheless, that
   Tertullian has only picked out those that were offensive to him, and
   that some of them are certainly to be preferred to interpretations
   which Tertullian himself gives. We also now understand why Tertullian
   clung to the sayings of the Paraclete in order to get over the
   difficulty of the uncertainty and even "Laxity" of many commands in the
   New Testament.

   We may then adopt as our conclusion: At least as early as the last
   decade of the second century there existed in the Church of Carthage
   (not only for Tertullian) a second Canon of Holy Scripture comprising
   two divisions treated as equal in dignity--Gospels and "Apostolus"--in
   compass essentially the same as that of the Muratorian Fragment, and in
   all probability with the "Apostolus" still open--open, that is, for
   genuine Apostolic works that might yet appear.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] Tertullian is concerned with the Church in Carthage, but in his
   latest works also with the Church in Rome, which, led by her bishop,
   rejects Montanism, champions the practices of the "Lax," and uses her
   influence in Carthage.

   [179] Tertullian expressly states (De Præsc., 8) that not heretics
   alone but also "our people" appeal to St Matt. vii. 7 ("Seek and ye
   shall find") as a justification for following their impulse to pry into
   the mysteries of religion. Tertullian declares that the text only
   refers to the Jews, or, if it also refers to Gentiles (Gentile
   Christians), it has force only under distinct limitations.

   [180] De Spect., 3: "Quorundam fides aut simplicior aut scrupulosior ad
   hanc abdicationem spectaculorum de scripturis auctoritatem exposcit et
   se in incertum constituit, quod non significanter neque nominatim
   denuntietur servis dei abstinentia eiusmodi"; cf. De Spect., 20: "Quam
   vana, immo desperata argumentatio corum, qui, sine dubio
   tergiversatione amittendæ voluptatis, obtendunt nullam eius abstinentiæ
   mentionem specialiter vel localiter in scripturis determinari, qua
   directo prohibeant eiusmodi conventibus inseri servum dei." De Cor., 2:
   "Si ideo dicetur coronari licere, quia non prohibeat scriptura."

   [181] De Bapt., 12.

   [182] De Pud., 18.

   [183] De Resurr., 50.

   [184] One of these special traits is that the woman looks for the
   drachma in her own house. Tertullian himself had once laid stress upon
   this point (De Præsc., 12). Elsewhere they bring forward the following
   points: In Scripture the sheep is everywhere the Christian, the flock
   is the people, and Christ is the Good Shepherd of His people; the sheep
   has thus been lost out of the fold; the light that the woman uses is
   the Word of God that shines in the house (the Church), also the hundred
   sheep, the ten drachmæ, the broom, all have their interpretation. The
   elder son is the Jew who grudges the Christian his reconciliation with
   God the Father. ("My opponents lay special stress upon this point.")
   The younger son cannot, however, be the heathen, he can only be the
   Christian, for "the injunction to repent does not apply to the heathen;
   for the sins of the heathen are not subject to repentance but are
   rather to be ascribed to ignorance, which is sinful in the sight of God
   only because of sin in nature; surely remedies are not used for those
   who are not in danger. Ground for repentance is only present where
   knowledge and will are implicated in the sin, where it is possible to
   speak of guilt and on the other hand of Grace; he alone can mourn, he
   only can be afflicted who knows what he has lost, and what he will
   obtain again if he offers his repentance to God, who naturally enjoins
   this more upon His children than upon strangers." Concerning these
   interpretations made by his opponents, Tertullian remarks (De Pud., 8):
   "With very many interpreters of parables the case is much the same as
   with those who trim garments with purple. They think that they have
   brought the tones of their colours into true harmony and by their
   contrast to have produced a lovely effect, but when the body comes to
   be fitted with the garment and it is placed in the right light, then
   the discords clash and reveal the whole construction as a ghastly
   mistake."

   [185] This is a peculiarly characteristic piece of exegesis: "Quod si
   et stadium contendas in scripturis nominari, sane obtinebis." It
   depends upon the axiom, "We have no right to blame what is not blamed
   in Holy Scripture," an axiom which is already found in Irenæus, and is
   also employed by the "Lax" to defend magic and astrology (vide supra on
   St Matt. ii. 1 f.).

   [186] That the Shepherd of Hermas was used at the beginning of the
   instruction of catechumens is clear from De Pud., 10.

   [187] Notice especially the references to the Acts of the Apostles, 1
   John, Revelation, and Hermas. It is significant that references to the
   Acts and Hermas are found already in the earliest works (De Bapt., De
   Orat., De Idol.). On the other hand it is not certain that the
   community regarded the "Apostolus" as closed; indeed the reference to
   the Acta Pauli makes this supposition improbable for the earlier
   period.

   [188] We must beware of defining Tertullian's attitude towards Holy
   Scripture simply in accordance with his controversial work De Præsc.;
   we must throughout also take his other treatises into consideration.
   According to De Resurr., 3, in controversy with heretics about
   doctrine, one must take one's stand on "scripturis solis." The
   strongest expression that Tertullian ever used in reference to
   Scripture stands in Adv. Hermog., 22: "Adoro scripturæ plenitudinem";
   note, however, that he does not say: "Adoro scripturam."

APPENDIX V

  "Instrumentum" ("Instrumenta") as a Name for the Bible

   Zahn (Gesch. des Neutestamentlichen Kanons, i. 106-111) has published a
   thorough investigation of the term "Instrumentum" as a title of the
   Bible; but in my opinion he starts from an incorrect premise, and gives
   to "Instrumentum," in connection with the Bible, a significance that is
   more general than is admissible.

   On pages 105 ff., Zahn writes: "Tertullian preferred to render Covenant
   by Instrumentum.' (In our investigation) we must start from this fact,
   incidentally revealed by Tertullian, that it was the prevailing custom
   among his contemporaries to express by Testamentum' what he preferred
   to call Instrumentum.' There is, accordingly, no doubt that in this as
   in similar cases Diatheke lies behind both terms." He then discusses
   "Instrumentum" in ordinary use and its relationship with "Documentum";
   he asserts that the term not seldom occurs in Tertullian in its
   original wider connotation, and in conclusion remarks: "We should do
   injustice to Tertullian if we suspected that the term Instrumentum'
   covers a conception of the significance of the Holy Scripture for the
   Church that is merely legal. The Holy Scriptures were for him by no
   means mainly documents that could be produced by the Church in her case
   against heretics (Zahn refers to De Præsc.); though, as a matter of
   course, they were authorities of the highest value for the Church." On
   page 109 Zahn speaks of the elasticity of the concept "Instrumentum" as
   applied to Holy Scripture.

   Three theses are here brought forward: (1) that "Instrumentum" in
   Tertullian (and when used elsewhere in the Church) is equivalent to
   "Testamentum"; (2) that "Instrumentum," like "Testamentum," is a
   translation of Diatheke; (3) that in Tertullian it has not only the
   special significance, "a fundamental document to prove doctrine," but
   also a more general significance. All these three theses are in my
   opinion incorrect, as I shall now proceed to prove.

   As for the first thesis, it is true that Tertullian writes (Adv. Marc.,
   iv. 1): "Duos deos dividit, proinde diversos, alterum alterius
   instrumenti, vel, quod magis usui est dicere, Testamenti." Here it is
   of course clear that Tertullian (and others here and there) spoke of
   "Instrumenta" while the usual term was "Testamenta." And yet it would
   be a mistake to assert that "Instrumentum" is an equivalent for
   "Testamentum." In cursory speech it can serve as such, but in itself is
   is not. This is most strikingly clear from the three following
   passages: in Adv. Prax., 20, Tertullian writes: "Totum instrumentum
   utriusque testamenti"; in De Monog., 4: "Secedat nunc mentio paracleti
   ut nostri (the Montanists) alicuius auctoris; evolvamus communia (to us
   and the Psychics') instrumenta scripturarum pristinarum (i.e. the Old
   Testament and New Testament)"; and in De Monog., 7: "Vetera instrumenta
   legalium scripturarum." Tertullian thus speaks of the "Instrument of
   the two Testaments," and of the "Instrument of the Holy Scriptures."
   "Instrumentum" cannot, therefore, be an equivalent for "Testamentum."
   This also means that we have already disposed of the second thesis
   which is in itself highly improbable, for how could anyone have arrived
   at "Instrumentum" as a translation of Diatheke? It is true that very
   remarkable translations are found in the Old Latin of the Church. Why
   was not "Foedus" rather than "Testamentum" used for Diatheke? Why was
   Musterion translated by "Sacramentum," etc.?--but "Instrumentum" has no
   connection, or only the slightest, with Diatheke. Further, Zahn himself
   is compelled to confess that in quotations from the Bible Tertullian
   never translates Diatheke by "Instrumentum." Hence the term
   "Instrumenta" in reference to the Bible is just as independent of
   Diatheke as are the terms "the Holy Scriptures" or "the Books." The
   term, therefore, must have its origin in considerations that have
   absolutely nothing to do with traditional names for the Bible, but are
   concerned only with its significance--and, indeed, in considerations
   that are confined to the Western Church; for, so far as I know,
   throughout the whole range of the Greek Churches no equivalent for
   "Instrumentum" existed either in the second century or later.

   We now come to Zahn's third thesis that the name "Instrumenta" for the
   Holy Scriptures is elastic, even if it approaches "Documenta" in
   meaning, and is not to be understood merely in a limited legal sense
   (documents to be produced by the Church against heretics). Here Zahn
   seems to be justified by the whole work, De Præsc. Hær., in which
   Catholics are earnestly warned not to appeal to the Holy Scriptures
   when they dispute with heretics; therefore Tertullian cannot have
   regarded Holy Scripture as the fundamental document for doctrine. But
   it has long been recognised that Tertullian has been the very last man
   to heed his own warning, and that this whole work is a masterpiece of
   advocacy, a piece of special pleading, where the real heart of the
   author appears in his exposition of the Church's Rule of Faith. Now
   chance has so willed that the only passage in the works of Tertullian,
   in which "Instrumenta," as applied to the Bible, is simply and plainly
   defined as "instrumenta doctrinæ," should be found in this very
   treatise, De Præsc. Here we read in chapter 28: "Illic et scripturarum
   et expositionum adulteratio deputanda est, ubi doctrinæ diversitas
   invenitur. quibus fuit propositum aliter docendi, eos necessitas coëgit
   aliter disponendi instrumenta doctrinæ. alias enim non potuissent
   aliter docere, nisi aliter haberent per quæ docerent. sicut illis non
   potuisset succedere correptula doctrinæ sine corruptula instrumentorum
   eius, ita et nobis integritas doctrinæ non competisset sine integritate
   eorum per quæ doctrina tractatur." There can be no doubt here: The Holy
   Scriptures are here called "instrumenta," because they are fundamental
   documents, with whose help alone doctrine can be expounded and by which
   it is proved; "instrumenta" and "per quæ doctrina tractatur" are for
   Tertullian identical conceptions. Naturally the exposition need not
   always have a polemical character; rather it is true also for the
   Church that she must in behalf of her own knowledge prove her doctrine
   "per instrumenta Scripturarum" ; so that the idea of a document is
   always implied in such proof. The Holy Scriptures are called
   "Instrumenta," because they are for the Church the decisive documents
   for the exposition and the proof of her doctrine.

   A survey of the passages in which Tertullian uses "instrumentum" will
   establish my position more clearly.

   Naturally not a few cases also occur in Tertullian of the use of the
   word in a quite general sense. For instance he writes:

   De Resurr., 63.--"Anima habet instrumentum, habet cultum, habet
   mancipium suum carnem."

   Apol., 17.--"Tota moles ista (the world) cum omni instrumento
   elementorum."

   Ad Uxor., 1.--"Continentia ad instrumentum æternitatis (pertinet)."

   De Cor., 8.--"Communia instrumenta exhibitionis (vitæ) humanæ."

   Again it is found in connection with the Conception "Literature" in
   general, and here it acquires the idea of a declarative and
   authoritative document:

   De Idol., 10.--"Litteratura instrumentum est ad omnem vitam."

   Apol., 19.--"Multis instrumentis adsidendum est, reserenda
   antiquissimarum etiam gentium archiva"--here the close relationship of
   "instrumenta" and "archiva" is noteworthy.

   Apol., 10.--"Si conscientia inficias ieret, de suis antiquitatum
   instrumentis revincetur."

   De Cor., 7 (The question is concerning the origin of
   garlands).--"Litteræ ad hoc sæculares necessariæ; de suis enim
   instrumentis sæcularia probari necesse est."

   De Spect., 5 (The question is concerning the origin of the games, this
   must be investigated)--"de instrumentis ethnicalium litterarum."

   De Testim., 1.--The works of philosophers and poets are the "proprium
   instrumentum" of the heathen from which their teachings are known.

   Scorp.,15.--"Si fidem commentarii voluerit hæreticus, instrumenta
   imperii loquentur ut lapides Hierusalem. Vitas Cæsarum' legimus." This
   use coincides with the common use of the period, especially with the
   use of the word in the sphere of civil and criminal law. Here it was
   quite usual to speak of "instrumenta publica, imperii, litis" (vide the
   Digests, Quintilian, Suetonius; Dirksen, Manuale Lat. Font. Jur. Civ.
   Rom., p. 484, etc.), indeed it may be said that here also
   "Instrumenta," applied to written records, always includes the idea of
   declarative and authoritative document, of archives as a source of
   right; at all events the burden of proof lies with him who denies this.
   I know only one passage in Tertullian where the addition of "doctrina"
   does not seem to be permissible; De Pud., 1, speaks of "instrumentum
   prædicationis"; but on closer view one finds here also that it is a
   question of "prædicatio doctrinæ."

   In the passages now to be mentioned the concept "doctrinæ" either must
   be supplied to "instrumenta" or is at least not excluded. [189] We
   incidentally remark that the expression "Instrumentum" was so useful
   because it could be applied to the whole Bible, to each of the two
   parts, to groups of books, to separate books, and even to separate
   sections of the books. [190]

   It refers to the whole Bible in De Præsc., 38; Adv. Marc., iv. 1; Adv.
   Prax., 20; De Monog., 4 (passages that have been already quoted); also
   in--

   De Pud., 16.--"Exereitus sententiarum instrumenti totius."

   De Resurr., 21.--"Tot ac talia instrumenta divina."

   De Pud., 10.--"Divinum Instrumentum."

   Adv. Marc., v. 1.--"Omnia apostolatus Pauli instrumenta" (all the
   sacred writings with the exception of the Pauline Epistles, which could
   not be used in this argument).

   Acta Perpet., 1.--"Instrumentum ecclesiæ."

   It refers to the New Testament in:

   De Præsc., 38.--"Integrum instrumentum."

   It very frequently refers to the Old Testament, because the Old
   Testament played the chief part as a proof-document. Instances are:

   Apol., 18.--"Instrumentum litteraturæ" (of the Old Testament as a
   proof-document).

   De Cultu, i. 3.--"Omne instrumentum Judaicæ litteraturæ."

   Apol., 21.--"Antiquissima Judæorum instrumenta."

   Apol., 47.--"Vetus Instrumentum."

   Ad Hermog., 20.--"Evangelium supplementum instrumenti veteris."

   Apol., 19.--"Instrumentis istis auctoritatem suam antiquitas vindicat."

   De Pud., 7.--"Lex et prophetæ = instrumenta."

   De Monog., 7--"Vetera instrumenta legalium scripturarum."

   Adv. Marc., v. 1.--"Instrumentum creatoris" (the Old Testament).

   "Instrumentum" is applied to separate books and groups of books in the
   following passages:

   Adv. Hermog., 19.--"Instrumentum originale Moysei" (cf. Adv. Marc., i.
   10).

   De Resurr., 33.--"Propheticum instrumentum."

   Adv. Marc., iv. 10.--"Instrumentum Danielis."

   Adv. Marc., iv. 2.--"Evangelicum instrumentum."

   De Resurr., 39, 40; De Pud., 12.--"Apostolicum instrumentum,"
   "Apostolica instrumenta."

   Adv. Marc., iv. 3.--"Instrumentum apostolorum."

   De Resurr., 38.--"Instrumentum Joannis."

   Adv. Marc., iv. 2; v. 6.--"Instrumentum Lucæ."

   Adv. Marc., v. 2.--"Instrumentum Actorum."

   Adv. Prax., 28 (De Resurr., 39, 40).--"Tota instrumenta Pauli."

   Adv. Marc., v. 13.--"Instrumentum" in connection with the Epistle to
   the Romans; but it may also refer to the whole New Testament.

   Lastly, "Tot originalia instrumenta Christi" in De Carne, 2, means the
   separate passages of the story of the Birth.

   The name "Instrumentum" ("Instrumenta"), when applied to the Bible, in
   idea places this book above doctrine--for the Bible is thus made the
   source of, and documentary authority for, doctrine--but actually it
   does the reverse. It is a term borrowed by Theology from Law--and
   therefore so welcome to Tertullian--that ignores the chief
   significances of the Bible as a book of religious edification. We never
   find expressions like "Instrumentum lectionis" or "Instrumentum
   ædificandæ ecclesiæ," nor could such expressions well be used. It would
   have been most unfortunate if the name "Instrumentum"--"divinum" would
   probably have been added--had established itself; but there was no
   danger that this would happen for it never became a rival of the name
   "Testamentum." The word is a creation of the ecclesiastical spirit of
   the West; as we have already remarked, nothing like it was known in the
   East. [191]

   It is very remarkable that Cyprian always avoids the word as a title
   for the Bible, likewise Lactantius, and, unless I mistake, Novatian
   also. Cyprian was simply not a professed theologian and dogmatic
   controversialist. The Bible with him ministered to "instructio vitæ,"
   while its significance as "instrumentum doctrinæ" fell quite into the
   background. Cyprian, the typical catechist, derives from the Bible
   "divina testimonia," which he also calls "magisteria divina" (Testim.,
   i., Præf.; iii., Præf.).

   Still the name "Instrumentum" for the Bible occurs not seldom in
   Jerome, Rufinus, and Augustine. Optatus too speaks of "instrumenta
   divina legis" (i. 13; vi. 5). [192] Thus the juristic spirit of
   Tertullian and of the West still lived on; nevertheless, at last the
   title "instrumenta" fell into utter oblivion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [189] Even when "instrumentum" is coupled with a genitive like
   "litteraturæ" or "ecclesiæ," the genitive "doctrinæ" can still always
   be supplied in thought.

   [190] Just for this very reason the attempts that have been made by
   Roensch and others to divide the New Testament into separate parts in
   accordance with the use of "instrumentum" by Tertullian are altogether
   mistaken, for Tertullian's usage here is quite arbitrary, and in
   different places he groups the books differently. "Testamenta" can only
   be applied to the two divisions of the Bible, and is, therefore, to a
   certain extent handicapped by "Instrumenta."

   [191] Allied to "instrumentum" is the name "paratura" for the Bible,
   which Tertullian endeavoured to introduce without success; this term
   too belongs to the vocabulary of demonstration and controversy; vide
   Apol., 47: "Nostra haec novitiola paratura"; De Cor., 1: "Calceatus de
   evangelii paratura"; Adv. Marc., iv. 3: "Paratura authentica"; De
   Monog.,7: "Omnis nostra paratura" Adv. Marc., iv. 1 (cf. ii. 1):
   "Paratura Marcionis" (the Bible of Marcion).

   [192] i. 37 (p. 30, 1): "Strumenta," not "instrumenta," is to be read.

APPENDIX VI

  A Short Statement and Criticism of the Results of Zahn's Investigations into
  the Origin of the New Testament.

   Following upon his great work, Geschichte des Neutestamentlichen
   Kanons, of more than 2000 pages, Zahn has published in his Grundriss
   der Geschichte des Neutestamentlichen Kanons, a short summary of the
   results of his investigations. On page 13 we find the sentence: "Unless
   there had been occasions for uncertainty as to the limits of the Bible
   (the New Testament) there would have been no history of the Canon."
   After this bold statement it must appear that, according to Zahn, the
   New Testament--like dogma for the Catholic Church--came into existence
   from the moment at which its latest book was published, and that there
   is such a thing as the "history" of the New Testament only, "because
   the Christian works that were used for public lection were not from the
   first absolutely the same in all orthodox communities," "because, even
   in one and the same community, variations in this practice lasted for
   quite a long time," and lastly, "because the conception of what should
   be regularly read at public worship had not been clearly defined," in
   so far as all kinds of works were read publicly that did not belong to
   the Canon. Finally, "Even among works inherited from the Apostolic age,
   differences, in respect of the frequency and regularity of their use in
   public worship, must have existed according as they were more or less
   suitable for religious instruction."

   There is still need of a short discussion of the results of Zahn's
   criticism, because these results are often developed in a way against
   which the author himself must feel inclined to enter an energetic
   protest. We hear everywhere that Zahn, the most learned of the critics,
   has proved that the New Testament came into existence so early as the
   end of the Apostolic age, about the year A.D. 100; and that so-called
   critics of far inferior learning place the origin of the New Testament
   about a century later. Against such a position we would establish the
   following points:

   1. The first part of Zahn's larger work, as well as his Grundriss,
   ought not to bear the title History of the Canon of the New Testament,
   but History of the public and private use of works that were afterwards
   united in the New Testament; in the second part also the question of
   public lection is very much to the front. The right to be read publicly
   and the right to be included in the Canon are jumbled together by Zahn
   as if they were identical, though he himself admits (vide supra) that
   the conception of what should be regularly read at public worship "had
   not been clearly defined." It is, indeed, quite true, that every work
   that was "Canonical" (in the sense of the Old Testament) was also read
   publicly, but the converse statement is simply inadmissible. Public
   lection was certainly a most important preliminary condition for the
   canonising of a book (in many cases, however, it was a consequence),
   but it was by no means the sole condition. I mean that because a book
   was read at public worship it is far from following that it had,
   therefore, the same dignity as the Old Testament. But this is the very
   point In so far, therefore, as Zahn, dealing with the earliest history
   of the "Canon of the New Testament," confines himself, and must confine
   himself, exclusively to proving the existence of certain smaller
   collections of books now in the New Testament and the fact that they
   were read publicly, his work is simply not a history of the Canon of
   the New Testament, but--even if all his investigations are correct and
   to the point--a history of the earliest public and private use of
   certain books. Moreover, it hangs together with this unjustifiable
   identification of public lection and Canon that Zahn, in his larger
   work, thinks that he may neglect all other aspects of the history of
   the origin of the New Testament. The most learned authority on the
   second century in his discussion of this question makes really no use
   of his knowledge of the opinions and controversies, of the problems
   great and small, that agitated the Christendom of those days. Hundreds
   of details in the history of that period are brought forward and
   investigated thoroughly and comprehensively, but the growing New
   Testament is never brought into connection with the living history of
   the Church--not at all because the author was unable to do this, but
   because he believes that it is not necessary--public lection alone is
   sufficient and decisive.

   2. In the Grundriss, Zahn has divided the early history of "the Canon
   of the New Testament" into three sections: "The New Testament about
   A.D. 170-220"; "The New Testament about A.D. 140-170"; "Earliest Traces
   of, and the Origin of, Collections of Apostolic works."

   The third section (i.e. the one dealing with the earliest period) ends
   (p. 40) with the following statement: " Many questions referring to the
   origin of the New Testament will always remain without a certain
   answer. Yet it may be regarded as certain that about the years A.D.
   80-110, both the fourfold' Gospel and the corpus of thirteen Pauline
   Epistles were in existence, and had been introduced into public worship
   along the whole line from Antioch to Rome, and that these two
   collections which form the most important part of the New Testament
   were from the first surrounded in public worship and in the estimation
   of the communities by a larger or smaller circle of Christian works
   that, like the two collections, seemed suitable for reading at public
   worship with a view to the religious instruction of the communities."
   Here, indeed, much more is asserted than can be proved and than Zahn
   himself has proved; for I cannot see--even on the basis of Zahn's own
   investigations -- what justification there is for going back to a date
   so early as A.D. 80, nor can I discover the evidence for "the whole
   line from Antioch to Rome," nor the authorities upon which Zahn rests
   his statement that the public reading of the Gospels and of the Pauline
   Epistles at that period is alike certain; indeed, I believe that Zahn
   himself, on closer reflection, would substitute the years A.D. 110-130
   for A.D. 80-110 as more appropriate for what he asserts. However,
   supposing that he is justified in what he claims, what, after all, is
   proved thereby? Surely no more than this, that in some, perhaps in
   several, communities, public lections from the four Gospels and the
   Pauline Epistles were the custom. It is well that Zahn himself has
   refrained in this connection from letting his pen write the word New
   Testament, and it is also good that he has guarded himself from naming
   the Christian works, apart from the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles,
   that were publicly read at that time. He only asserts that at that time
   already other works were so honoured, and to this assertion no
   objection can be raised. Seeing now that he preserves absolute silence
   concerning the years A.D. 110-140, we must assume that during that
   period absolutely no change took place in the conditions that are
   supposed to have already existed between A.D. 80 and 110--this means
   that, according to Zahn, we cannot prove that a New Testament, set on
   the same level as the Old Testament, existed during the period before
   A.D. 140. The four Gospels were read publicly, the Pauline Epistles
   were read publicly, some other works were read publicly--that is all.

   But Zahn does assert the existence of the New Testament, at all events,
   for the period A.D. 140-170. This section of his work bears the title:
   "The New Testament about A.D. 140-170," and he probably thinks also of
   certain deductions that can be made, not without justification, for the
   former period, though he does not enter into them. The evidence,
   however, that the New Testament was in existence in the Church during
   that generation is exclusively based upon the Bible of Marcion, the
   Bible of the Valentinians, and the writings of the Apostles in Justin.
   Here we would make the following observations: (1) in reference to
   Marcion it is, of course, as good as certain that he dealt as a critic
   with the four Gospels of the Church; but all other questions--whether
   he knew of the Pastoral Epistles, whether he criticised the Acts of the
   Apostles or the Apocalypse, etc.--must unfortunately remain unanswered.
   As for the main question, however, whether he knew of, or assumes the
   existence of, a written New Testament of the Church in any sense
   whatever, in this case an affirmatory answer is most improbable,
   because if this were so he would have been compelled to make a direct
   attack upon the New Testament of the Church, and if such an attack had
   been made we should have heard of it from Tertullian. Marcion, on the
   contrary, treats the Catholic Church as one that "follows the Testament
   of the Creator-God," and directs the full force of his attack against
   this Testament and against the falsification of the Gospel and of the
   Pauline Epistles by the original Apostles and the writers of the
   Gospels. He would necessarily have dealt with the two Testaments of the
   Catholic Church if the Church had already possessed a New Testament.
   His polemic would necessarily have been much less simple if he had been
   opposed to a Church which, by possessing a New Testament side by side
   with the Old Testament, had ipso facto placed the latter under the
   shelter of the former. In fact Marcion's position towards the Catholic
   Church is intelligible, in the full force of its simplicity, only under
   the supposition that the Church had not yet in her hand any "litera
   scripta Novi Testamenti." (2) In reference to the Valentinian school
   Zahn asserts that: "The New Testament, which from the productions of
   the most important Gnostic School of about A.D. 140 in all its
   ramifications, we learn to have been the common possession of the
   Church, was identical with the New Testament of about A.D. 200;" but in
   order to arrive at such a result the truth of many incorrect equations
   must be assumed. It is not necessary here to discuss all these; we
   would, however, just make only the following remarks: In the first
   place we must neglect all the information derived from the Fathers of
   about A.D. 200 who assert or assume the identity of the New Testament
   of the Valentinians with that of the Church, for it is a well-known
   fact that the Valentinians both kept in touch with the Church and also
   conformed outwardly to the progressive development of the times in
   things ecclesiastical ("communem fidem adfirmant"). Next we must give
   special prominence to Ptolemy's words (Ep. ad Floram., 1, 9): "We shall
   prove our statement (concerning the Godhead, the Old Testament, etc.)
   from the Words of our Saviour; for with their help it is alone possible
   to arrive without stumbling at the understanding of reality." [193]
   Thus, according to Ptolemy, who like all Valentinians adopted a
   critical attitude towards the Old Testament, the Word of the Lord is
   the sole court of final appeal. His practice is actually in accordance
   with this belief, and he derives the Word of the Lord from the Gospels.
   The testimony of "the disciples of Jesus and of the Apostles" (vide
   chap. iv. 5, etc.) occupies only a secondary place in his regard; for
   him it has clearly no independent, but only a derivative, authority (as
   it, and so far as it coincides with the Words of the Saviour); he
   quotes only Epistles of St Paul and statements of John, the Apostle and
   Evangelist. Lastly, he takes account of the apostolike paradosis, hen
   ek diadoches kai hemeis pareilephamen (chap. v. 10). Therefore in the
   case of Ptolemy we cannot speak of a New Testament, because he
   evidently does not possess or know of a collection in which Gospels and
   Apostolic Epistles stand on one level. All that we learn elsewhere of
   the ancient Valentinian School and of Valentinus himself fits in with
   what we learn from Ptolemy. Their high reverence for, and their use of
   the Pauline Epistles never justify the equation: "Epistulæ (i.e.
   Paulus)= Evangelia." I cannot see, as Zahn asserts, that "clear traces"
   of the Acts, 1 and 2 Peter, and Hebrews are to be found among the
   Valentinians; but even if that were so, there would still remain the
   question what value Valentinus and his school ascribed to these works.
   Summing up, we may say that Valentinus and his earlier followers set up
   in place of the Old Testament as their highest court of appeal the Word
   of the Lord contained in the Gospels, with which they associated, as a
   secondary authority, the Pauline Epistles and their own secret
   Apostolic tradition. Among them nothing like the New Testament, so far
   as structure is concerned, was as yet in existence. Arguing, then, from
   this to what then obtained in the Church, we can only say: The Church
   at that time possessed the Canon of the Four Gospels, and read side by
   side with it the collection of Pauline Epistles. This, however, does
   not carry us very far in Zahn's direction.

   3. According to Zahn, Justin is a witness to the New Testament for (a)
   he places the Apomnemoneumata ton apostolon on the same level with the
   "Writings of the Prophets"; "as, however, the whole Old Testament, is
   intended to be included under the latter title, so also the name Apomn.
   t. apost. by no means excludes other Christian writings"; (b) Justin
   knows the Johannine Apocalypse as a work of the Apostle John and as a
   genuine product of Christian Prophecy; [194] (c) "Justin as an
   apologist had no occasion to mention other Apostolic works in the same
   way as the Apocalypse; but we find that his religious ideas and form of
   expression are affected by his diligent reading, of the following
   works: Rom., 1 Cor., Gal., Eph., (Phil.?), Col., 2 Thess., (Titus, 1
   Tim.?), Heb., 1 Pet., (James?), Acts, and Didache." Against these
   statements we would assert that (a) the statement that the expression
   Apomn. t. apost. does not exclude other Christian writings is only
   correct if we at once add that it also does not include them. I will
   not waste words here, for the thesis is as inadmissible as the argument
   by which it is based on the clause, "The whole Old Testament is
   intended to be included under the Writings of the Prophets." Are then
   Sungrammata and Apomnemoneumata the same? Can we subsume the Pauline
   Epistles or the Acts of the Apostles under Apomnemoneumata? (b) The
   fact that Justin knows of the Apocalypse and knows of it as a book of
   public lection--though, indeed, be does say this in so many words--has
   nothing to do with the question of the New Testament so long as we do
   not know whether this book was placed on a level with the Gospels at
   the time of Justin. If the Apocalypse stood by itself, like many other
   Jewish and Christian Apocalypses at that time, Justin's notice does not
   come into consideration for the history of the New Testament in the
   strict sense of the term. (g) Justin's views and expressions may have
   been influenced by many early Christian writings, traces of which Zahn
   believes that he has found; yet Zahn himself does not venture to assert
   that Justin regarded these as canonical; Zahn leaves this conclusion to
   the reader. However, a reader who carefully studies the Dialogue with
   Trypho is not only not able to draw such a conclusion, but is rather
   compelled to regard the opposite as proved. Zahn, indeed, asserts that
   Justin, as an apologist, had no occasion to express himself concerning
   the canonical prestige of Apostolic works ; but the case is otherwise:
   Justin, with an enormous expense of labour in collection of passages,
   seeks to deduce a New Testament (or the New Testament) from the Old
   Testament, and from the Old Testament to prove its existence. He could
   not do otherwise in controversy with a Jew. But why does he not do
   what, for instance, Tertullian does dozens of times in reference to the
   Collection of Sayings of the Paraclete, which was not recognised by his
   opponents in the Church? Why does he not once at least say: "We
   Christians possess a New Testament in form of litera scripta"? The
   reserve which he here adopts is simply unintelligible if a New
   Testament was in existence in the Church. It was simply not in
   existence! Justin knows the new Covenant as a fact that had its litera
   scripta only in the Old Testament. He says nothing about the New
   Testament, not only because he is an apologist, but because no New
   Testament stood at his disposal; he never speaks even of the Gospels as
   "New Testament," and if he had done so there is nothing to show that
   for Justin other early Christian writings stood upon the same high
   level as the Gospels. The grounds for the assertion that Justin
   presupposes the New Testament are as unsound as in the cases of Marcion
   and Valentinus.

   Lastly, in the section dealing with the New Testament of about A.D.
   170-220, Zahn investigates the changes that the already existing New
   Testament experienced during that period. Here, however, as a kind of
   headline, we find the sentence (p. 15): "The New Testament at that time
   was far from being something clearly defined." In fact as we read the
   many detailed discussions here and in the parallel sections of the
   larger work, we not seldom forget that we are supposed to be dealing
   with certain discrepancies in a work already created; rather we have
   the impression that we have before us something that is just coming
   into being. Hence there is comparatively little here that provokes
   controversy, and, indeed, it may be regarded a matter of indifference
   whether we describe the tremendous changes, which Zahn himself allows
   to have taken place between A.D. 170 and 220, as the "Origin" of the
   New Testament out of previous stages of existence, or as the
   "development" of something that was already in existence, but was as
   yet unborn. Zahn himself, however, allows, so far as I see, that the
   name "New Testament" first makes its appearance during this period.

   Zahn himself will not have us speak in set words of the "New Testament"
   until about A.D. 130 or 140; he asserts its existence for the following
   generation (even if the name is absent); but on the one hand the proofs
   for the latter thesis do not hold good, and on the other hand he
   himself allows that the New Testament about A.D. 170 was still an
   unfinished work, and in any case that nowhere in the Church did it
   appear as something clearly defined. There is no question, therefore,
   of a difference of one hundred years between Zahn and the other
   critics, but of a much smaller space of time, which would contract
   still more closely if Zahn would bring himself to take as punctum
   saliens not the public lection of the separate works, but the setting
   of a new collection of sacred writings on a level with the Old
   Testament.

   With these remarks I am far from wishing to renew a controversy that
   years ago was carried on between Zahn and myself with only too much
   strong feeling; but seeing that an accurate and scientifically balanced
   account of the character of the controversy has not been drawn up, and
   seeing especially that the actual results of Zahn's work are exploited
   in favour of an entirely unscientific point of view, it seemed to me
   necessary, in these studies of the origin of the New Testament, to set
   the facts in a clear light.

   [194] Zahn adds (p. 34): "It is self-evident that the Apocalypse, in
   accordance with its own demand, was repeatedly read aloud in the
   assemblies of the communities that so accepted it."
