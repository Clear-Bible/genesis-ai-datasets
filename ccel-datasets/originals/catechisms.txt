   Two

   Short Catechisms:

   wherein the

   Principles of the Doctrine of Christ

   are

   unfolded and explained.

   Proper for all persons to learn
   before they be admitted to the sacrament of the Lord's supper; and
   composed for the use of all congregations in general.

                                Prefatory Note.

   The first edition of these Catechisms issued from the press in 1645. Dr
   Owen had at that time the charge of the parish of Fordham in Essex, and
   laboured diligently for the instruction and benefit of his flock, by
   catechising from house to house. The catechisms were prepared in order
   that he might accomplish these parochial duties with greater efficiency
   and success. "The Lesser Catechism" is designed for the instruction of
   children; -- "The Greater," for the examination of persons more
   advanced in years. They are chiefly doctrinal. It was the intention of
   Owen to have followed up this little work by another Catechism on the
   Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and some articles of the Creed.
   This intention, however, was never fulfilled. These Catechisms on "the
   Principles of the Doctrine of Christ" are included in this volume, --
   which embodies all the treatises of Owen directly relating to the
   second Person of the Trinity, -- inasmuch as, according to a statement
   of the author in the preface, they were intended to remind his people
   of what he had publicly taught them, "especially concerning the person
   and offices of Christ." They were among the first, as the other
   treatises in this volume are among the last, of our author's
   publications; and we are thus enabled to mark the undeviating
   consistency with which, during all the ministrations of his public
   course, Owen held fast by the great doctrines of the Gospel, -- "the
   unsearchable riches of Christ." -- Ed.

                 To my Loving Neighbours and Christian Friends.

   Brethren,

   My heart's desire and request unto God for you is, that you may be
   saved. I say the truth in Christ also, I lie not, my conscience bearing
   me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness, and
   continual sorrow in my heart, for them amongst you who, as yet, walk
   disorderly, and not as beseemeth the Gospel, little labouring to
   acquaint themselves with the mystery of godliness; for many walk, of
   whom I have told you often weeping, and now tell you again with sorrow,
   that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is
   destruction, whose god is their belly, who mind earthly things.

   You know, brethren, how I have been amongst you, and in what manner,
   for these few years past, and how I have kept back nothing (to the
   utmost of the dispensation to me committed) that was profitable unto
   you; but have showed you, and taught you publicly and from house to
   house, testifying to all repentance towards God, and faith towards our
   Lord Jesus Christ. Now, with what sincerity this hath been by me
   performed, with what issue and success by you received, God the
   righteous Judge will one day declare; for before him must both you and
   I appear, to give an account of the dispensation of the glorious Gospel
   amongst us; -- in the meanwhile, the desire of my heart is, to be
   servant to the least of you in the work of the Lord; and that in any
   way which I can concede profitable unto you, -- either in your persons
   or your families.

   Now, amongst my endeavours in this kind, after the ordinance of public
   preaching the Word, there is not, I conceive, any more needful (as all
   will grant that know the estate of this place, how taught of late days,
   how full of grossly ignorant persons) than catechising; which hath
   caused me to set aside some hours for the compiling of these following,
   which also I have procured to be printed, merely because the least part
   of the parish are able to read it in writing; -- my intention in them
   being, principally, to hold out those necessary truths wherein you have
   been in my preaching more fully instructed. As they are, the use of
   them I shall briefly present unto you:--

   1. The Lesser Catechism may be so learned of the younger sort, that
   they may be ready to answer to every question thereof.

   2. The Greater will call to mind much of what hath been taught you in
   public, especially concerning the Person and Offices of Jesus Christ.

   3. Out of that you may have help to instruct your families in the
   Lesser, being so framed, for the most part, that a chapter of the one
   is spent in unfolding a question of the other.

   4. The texts of Scripture quoted are diligently to be sought out and
   pondered, that you may know indeed whether these things are so.

   5. In reading the Word, you may have light into the meaning of many
   places, by considering what they are produced to confirm.

   6. I have been sparing in the doctrine of the Sacraments, because I
   have already been so frequent in examinations about them.

   7. The handling of moral duties I have wholly omitted, because, by
   God's assistance, I intend for you a brief explication of the Lord's
   Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, with some articles of the Creed, not
   unfolded in these, by themselves, by the way of question and answer.

   Now, in all this, as the pains hath been mine, so I pray that the
   benefit may be yours, and the praise His, to whom alone any good that
   is in this or any thing else is to be ascribed. Now, the God of heaven
   continue that peace, love, and amity, amongst ourselves, which hitherto
   hath been unshaken, in these divided times, and grant that the sceptre
   and kingdom of his Son may be gloriously advanced in your hearts, that
   the things which concern your peace may not be hidden from your eyes in
   this your day; which is the daily prayer of

   Your servant in the work of the Lord,

   J. O.

   From my Study,
   September the last, [1645].

   [1] Every one out of this way everlastingly damned.

   [2] The life of religion is in the Life.

   [3] Popish traditions are false lights, leading from God.

   [4] The authority of the Scripture dependeth not on the authority of
   the church, as the Papists blaspheme.

   [5] All human inventions unnecessary helps in the worship of God.

   [6] The word thereof is the sole directory for faith, worship, and
   life.

   [7] This alone persuadeth and inwardly convinceth the heart of the
   divine verity of the Scripture; other motives, also, there are from
   without, and unanswerable arguments to prove the truth of them, as, --
   1. Their antiquity; 2. Preservation from fury; 3. Prophecies in them;
   4. The holiness and majesty of their doctrine agreeable to the nature
   of God; 5. Miracles; 6. The testimony of the church of all ages; 7. The
   blood of innumerable martyrs, &c.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] The perfection of God's being is known of us chiefly by removing
   all imperfections.

   [9] Hence the abominable vanity of idolaters, and of the blasphemous
   Papists, that picture God.

   [10] Let us prostrate ourselves in holy adoration of that which we
   cannot comprehend.

   [11] The divers names of God signify one and the same thing, but under
   diverse notions in respect of our conception.

   [12] Some of these attributes belong so unto God, as that they are in
   no sort to be ascribed to any else, -- as infiniteness, eternity, &c.
   Others are after a sort attributed to some of his creatures, in that he
   communicates unto them some of the effects of them in himself; -- as
   life, goodness, &c.

   [13] The first of these are motives to humble adoration, fear,
   self-abhorrency; the other, to faith, hope, love, and confidence,
   through Jesus Christ.

   [14] Nothing is to be ascribed unto God, nor imagined of him, but what
   is exactly agreeable to those his glorious properties.

   [15] These last are no less essential unto God than the former -- only
   we thus distinguish them, because these are chiefly seen in his works.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. III. -- Of the Holy Trinity.

   Q. 1. Is there but one God to whom these properties do belong?

   A. ^aOne only, in respect of his essence and being, but one ^bin three
   distinct persons, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
   ^aDeut. vi. 4; Matt. xix. 17; Eph. iv. 5, 6. ^bGen. i. 26; 1 John v. 7;
   Matt. xxviii. 19.

   Q. 2. What mean you by person?

   A. A distinct manner of [16] [17] [18] subsistence or being,
   distinguished from the other persons by its own properties.
   John v. 17; Heb. i. 3.

   Q. 3. What is the distinguishing property of the person of the Father?

   A. To be of himself only the fountain of the Godhead.
   John v. 26, 27; Eph. i. 3.

   Q. 4. What is the property of the Son?

   A. To be begotten of his Father from eternity.
   Ps. ii. 7; John i. 14, iii. 16.

   Q. 5. What of the Holy Ghost?

   A. To proceed from the Father and the Son.
   John xiv. 17, xvi. 14, xv. 26, xx. 22.

   Q. 6. Are these three one?

   A. One ^aevery way, in nature, will, and essential properties,
   ^bdistinguished only in their personal manner of subsistence.
   ^aJohn x. 30; Rom. iii. 30. ^bJohn xv. 26; 1 John v. 7.

   Q. 7. Can we conceive these things as they are in themselves?

   A. Neither ^awe nor yet the ^bangels [19] of heaven are at all able to
   dive into these secrets, as they are internally in God; ^cbut in
   respect of the outward dispensation of themselves to us by creation,
   redemption, and sanctification, a knowledge may be attained of these
   things, saving and heavenly.
   ^a1 Tim. vi. 16. ^bIsa. vi. 2, 3. ^cCol. i. 11-14.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] This is that mysterious ark that must not be pried into, nor the
   least tittle spoken about it, wherein plain Scripture goeth not before.

   [17] To deny the Deity of any one person, is in effect to deny the
   whole Godhead for whosoever hath not the Son, hath not the Father.

   [18] This only doctrine remained undefiled in the Papacy.

   [19] We must labour to make out comfort from the proper work of every
   person towards us.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. IV. -- Of the Works of God; and, First, of those that are Internal and
Immanent.

   Q. 1. What do the Scriptures teach concerning the works of God?

   A. That they are of two sorts; first, internal, [20] in his counsel,
   decrees, and purposes, towards his creatures; secondly, external, in
   his works over and about them, to the praise of his own glory.
   Acts xv. 18; Prov. xvi. 4.

   Q. 2. What are the decrees of God?

   A. ^aEternal, ^bunchangeable purposes [21] [22] [23] of his will,
   concerning the being and well-being of his creatures.
   ^aMic. v. 2; Eph. iii. 9-11; Acts xv. 18. ^bIsa. xiv. 24, xlvi. 10;
   Rom. ix. 11; 2 Tim. ii. 19.

   Q. 3. Concerning which of his creatures chiefly are his decrees to be
   considered?

   A. Angels and men, for whom other things were ordained.
   1 Tim. v. 21; Jude 6.

   Q. 4. What are the decrees of God concerning men?

   A. Election and reprobation.
   Rom. ix. 11-13.

   Q. 5. What is the decree of election?

   A. The ^aeternal, ^bfree, ^cimmutable [24] [25] purpose of God,
   ^dwhereby in Jesus Christ he chooseth unto himself whom he pleaseth out
   of ^ewhole mankind, determining to bestow upon them, for his sake,
   ^fgrace here, and everlasting happiness hereafter, for the praise of
   his glory, by the way of mercy. [26]
   ^aEph. i. 4; Acts xiii. 48; Rom. viii. 29, 30. ^bMatt. xi. 26. ^c2 Tim.
   ii. 19. ^dEph i. 4, 5; Matt. xxii. 14. ^eRom. ix. 18-21. ^fJohn vi. 37,
   xvii. 6, 9, 11, 24.

   Q. 6. Doth any thing in us move the Lord thus to choose us from amongst
   others?

   A. No, in no wise; we are in the same lump with others rejected, when
   separated by his undeserved grace.
   Rom. ix. 11, 12; Matt. xi. 25; 1 Cor. iv. 7; 2 Tim. i. 9.

   Q. 7. What is the decree of reprobation?

   A. The eternal purpose of God to suffer many to sin, leave them in
   their sin, and not giving them to Christ, to punish them for their sin.
   Rom. ix. 11, 12, 21, 22; Prov. xvi. 4; Matt. xi. 25, 26; 2 Pet. ii. 12;
   Jude 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [20] The purposes and decrees of God, so far as by him revealed, are
   objects of our faith, and full of comfort.

   [21] Farther reasons of God's decrees than his own will, not to be
   inquired after.

   [22] The changes in the scripture ascribed unto God are only in the
   outward dispensations and works, variously tending to one infallible
   event, by him proposed.

   [23] The Arminians' blasphemy, in saying God sometimes fails of his
   purposes.

   [24] The decree of election is the fountain of all spiritual graces,
   for they are bestowed only on the elect.

   [25] In nothing doth natural corruption more exalt itself against God,
   than in opposing the freedom of his grace in his eternal decrees.

   [26] From the execution of these decrees flows that variety and
   difference we see in the dispensation of the means of grace, -- God
   sending the Gospel where he hath a remnant according to election.

Chap. V. -- Of the Works of God that outwardly are of Him.

   Q. 1. What are the works of God that outwardly respect his creatures?

   A. First, of creation; secondly, of [27] actual providence.
   Ps. xxxiii. 9; Heb. i. 2, 3.

   Q. 2. What is the work of creation?

   A. An act or work of God's almighty power, whereby of nothing, in six
   days, he created heaven, earth, and the sea, with all things in them
   contained.
   Gen. i. 1; Exod. xx. 11; Prov. xvi. 4.

   Q. 3. Wherefore did God make man?

   A. For his own glory in his service [28] [29] and obedience.
   Gen. i. 26, 27, ii. 16, 17; Rom. ix. 23.

   Q. 4. Was man able to yield the service and worship that God required
   of him?

   A. Yea, to the uttermost, being created upright in the image of God, in
   purity, innocence, righteousness, and holiness.
   Gen. i. 26; Eccles. vii. 29; Eph. iv. 24; Col. iii. 10.

   Q. 5. What was the rule whereby man was at first to be directed in his
   obedience?

   A. The moral [30] or eternal law of God, implanted in his nature and
   written in his heart by creation, being the tenor of the covenant
   between God and him, sacramentally typified by the tree of knowledge of
   good and evil.
   Gen. ii. 15-17; Rom. ii. 14, 15; Eph. iv. 24.

   Q. 6. Do we stand in the same covenant still, and have we the same
   power to yield obedience unto God?

   A. No; the ^acovenant was [31] broken by the sin of Adam, with whom it
   was made, ^bour nature corrupted, ^cand all power to do good utterly
   lost.
   ^aGen. iii. 16-18; Gal. iii. 10, 11, 21; Heb. vii. 19, viii. 13. ^bJob
   xiv. 4; Ps. li. 5. ^cGen. vi. 5; Jer. xiii. 23.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [27] The very outward works of God are sufficient to convince men of
   his eternal power and Godhead, and to leave them inexcusable, if they
   serve him not.

   [28] The glory of God is to be preferred above our own either being or
   well-being, as the supreme end of them.

   [29] The approaching unto God in his service is the chief exaltation of
   one nature above the beasts that perish.

   [30] God never allowed, from the beginning, that the will of the
   creature should be the measure of his worship and honour.

   [31] Though we have all lost our right unto the promise of the first
   covenant, yet all not restored by Christ are under the commination and
   curse thereof.

Chap. VI. -- Of God's actual Providence.

   Q. 1. What is God's actual providence?

   A. The effectual working of his [32] [33] [34] power, and almighty act
   of his will, whereby he sustaineth, governeth, and disposeth of all
   things, men and their actions, to the ends which he hath ordained for
   them.
   Exod. iv. 11; Job v. 10-12, ix. 5, 6; Ps. cxlvii. 4; Prov. xv. 3; Isa.
   xlv. 6, 7; John v. 17; Acts xvii. 28; Heb. i. 3.

   Q. 2. How is this providence exercised towards mankind?

   A. Two ways; first, ^apeculiarly towards his church, or elect, in their
   generations, for whom are all things; secondly, ^btowards all in a
   general manner, yet with various and divers dispensations.
   ^aDeut. xxxii. 10; Ps. xvii. 8; Zech. ii. 8; Matt. xvi. 18, xix. 2, 29;
   1 Pet. v. 7. ^bGen. ix. 5; Ps. lxxv. 6, 7; Isa. xlv. 6, 7; Matt. v. 45.

   Q. 3. Wherein chiefly consists the outward providence of God towards
   his church?

   A. In three things; -- first, in ^acausing all [35] things to work
   together for their good; secondly, in ^bruling and disposing of
   kingdoms, nations, and persons, for their benefit; thirdly, ^cin
   avenging them of their adversaries.
   ^aMatt. vi. 31-33; Rom. viii. 28; 1 Tim. vi. 17; 2 Pet. i. 3. ^bPs. cv.
   14,15; Isa. xliv. 28; Dan. ii. 44; Rom. ix. 17. ^cIsa. lx. 12; Zech.
   xii. 2-5; Luke xviii. 7; Rev. xvii. 14.

   Q. 4. Doth God rule also in and over the sinful actions of wicked men?

   A. Yea, he willingly (according [36] to his determinate counsel)
   suffereth them to be, for the manifestation of his glory, and by them
   effecteth his own righteous ends.
   2 Sam. xii. 11, xvi. 10; 1 Kings xi. 31, xxii. 22; Job i. 21; Prov.
   xxii. 14; Isa. x. 6, 7; Ezek. xxi. 19-21; Amos vii. 17; Acts iv. 27,
   28; Rom. i. 24, ix. 22; 1 Pet. ii. 8; Rev. xvii. 17.

   Q. 5. Doth the providence of God extend itself to every small thing?

   A. The least grass of the field, hair of our heads, or worm of the
   earth, is not exempted from his knowledge and care.
   Job xxxix.; Ps. civ. 21, cxlv. 15; Jonah iv. 7; Matt. vi. 26-29, x. 29,
   30.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [32] To this providence is to be ascribed all the good we do enjoy, and
   all the afflictions we undergo.

   [33] Fortune, chance, and the like, are names without things, scarce
   fit to be used among Christians, seeing Providence certainly ruleth all
   to appointed ends.

   [34] No free-will in man exempted either from the eternal decree or the
   over-ruling providence of God.

   [35] Though the dispensations of God's providence towards his people be
   various, yet every issue and act of it tends to one certain end, --
   their good in his glory.

   [36] Almighty God knows how to bring light out of darkness, good out of
   evil, the salvation of his elect out of Judas's treachery, the Jews'
   cruelty, and Pilate's injustice.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. VII. -- Of the Law of God.

   Q. 1. Which is the law that God gave man at first to fulfil?

   A. The same which was afterwards [37] written with the finger of God in
   two tables of stone on Mount Horeb, called the Ten Commandments.
   Rom. ii. 14, 15.

   Q. 2. Is the observation of this law still required of us?

   A. Yes, to the uttermost tittle.
   Matt. v. 17; 1 John iii. 4; Rom. iii. 31; James ii. 8-10; Gal. iii.

   Q. 3. Are we able of ourselves to [38] [39] perform it?

   A. No, in no wise; the law is spiritual, but we are carnal.
   1 Kings viii. 46; Gen. vi. 5; John xv. 5; Rom. vii. 14, viii. 7; 1 John
   i. 8.

   Q. 4. Did, then, God give a law which could not be kept?

   A. No; when God gave it, we had power to keep it; which since we have
   lost in Adam.
   Gen. i. 26; Eph. iv. 19; Rom. v. 12.

   Q. 5. Whereto, then, doth the law now serve?

   A. For two general ends; first, ^ato be a rule of our duty, or to
   discover to us the obedience of God required; secondly, ^bto drive us
   unto Christ.
   ^aPs. xix. 7-11; 1 Tim. i. 8, 9. ^bGal. iii. 24.

   Q. 6. How doth the law drive us unto Christ?

   A. Divers ways; as, first, ^aby laying open unto us the utter
   disability of our nature to do any good; secondly, ^bby charging the
   wrath and curse of God, due to sin, upon the conscience; thirdly, ^cby
   bringing the whole soul under bondage to sin, death, Satan, and hell,
   so making us long and seek for a Saviour.
   ^aRom. vii. 7-9; Gal. iii. 19. ^bRom. iii. 19, 20, iv. 15, v. 20; Gal.
   iii. 10. ^cGal. iii. 22; Heb. ii. 15.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [37] This law of God bindeth us now, not because delivered to the Jews
   on Mount Horeb, but because written in the hearts of all by the finger
   of God at the first.

   [38] After the fall, the law ceased to be a rule of justification, and
   became a rule for sanctification only.

   [39] It is of free grace that God giveth power to yield any obedience,
   and accepteth of any obedience that is not perfect.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. VIII. -- Of the State of Corrupted Nature.

   Q. 1. How came this weakness and disability upon us?

   A. By the sin and [40] shameful fall of our first parents.
   Rom. v. 12, 14.

   Q. 2. Wherein did that hurt us, their posterity?

   A. Divers ways; first, ^ain that we were all guilty of the same breach
   of covenant with Adam, being all in him; secondly, ^bour souls with his
   were deprived of that holiness, innocence, and righteousness wherein
   they were at first created; thirdly, ^cpollution and defilement of
   nature came upon us; with, fourthly, ^dan extreme disability of doing
   any thing that is well-pleasing unto God; ^eby all which we are made
   obnoxious to the curse.
   ^aJohn iii. 36; Rom. v. 12; Eph. ii. 3. ^bGen. iii. 10; Eph iv. 23, 24;
   Col. iii. 10. ^cJob xiv. 4; Ps. li. 7; John iii. 6; Rom. iii. 13.
   ^dGen. vi. 5; Eph. ii. 1; Jer. vi. 16, xiii. 23; Rom. viii. 7. ^eGen.
   iii. 17; Gal. iii. 10.

   Q. 3. Wherein doth the curse of God consist?

   A. In divers things; first, ^ain the [41] guilt of death, temporal and
   eternal; secondly, ^bthe loss of the grace and favour of God; thirdly,
   ^cguilt and horror of conscience, despair and anguish here; with,
   fourthly, ^deternal damnation hereafter.
   ^aGen. ii. 17; Rom. i. 18, v. 12, 17; Eph. ii. 3. ^bGen. iii. 24; Ezek.
   xvi. 3-5; Eph ii. 13. ^cGen. iii. 10; Isa. xlviii. 22; Rom. iii. 9, 19,
   Gal. iii. 22. ^dGen. iii. 10, 13; John iii. 36.

   Q. 4. Are all men born in this estate?

   A. Every one without exception.
   Ps. li. 5; Isa. liii. 6; Rom. iii. 9-12; Eph. ii. 3.

   Q. 5. And do they continue therein?

   A. Of themselves [42] they cannot otherwise do, being able neither to
   ^aknow, nor ^bwill, nor ^cdo any thing that is spiritually good and
   pleasing unto God.
   ^aActs viii. 31, xvi. 14; 1 Cor. ii. 14; Eph. v. 8; John i. 5. ^bJer.
   vi. 16, xiii. 23; Luke iv. 18; Rom. vi. 16, viii. 7. ^cJohn vi. 44; 2
   Cor. iii. 5.

   Q. 6. Have they, then, no way of themselves to escape the curse and
   wrath of God?

   A. None at all; they can neither satisfy his justice, nor fulfil his
   law.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [40] This is that which commonly is called original sin, which in
   general denoteth the whole misery and corruption of our nature; as, --
   1. The guilt of Adam's actual sin to us imputed; 2. Loss of God's
   glorious image, innocency and holiness; 3. Deriving by propagation a
   nature -- (1.) Defiled with the pollution, (2.) Laden with the guilt,
   (3.) Subtitled to the power of sin; 4. A being exposed to all temporal
   miseries, leading to and procuring death; 5. An alienation from God,
   with voluntary obedience to Satan and lust; 6. An utter disability to
   good, or to labour for mercy; 7. Eternal damnation of body and soul in
   hell.

   [41] All that a natural man hath on this side hell is free mercy.

   [42] The end of this is Jesus Christ, to all that fly for refuge to the
   hope set before them.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. IX. -- Of the Incarnation of Christ.

   Q. 1. Shall all mankind, then, everlastingly perish?

   A. No; God, of his free grace, hath prepared a way to redeem and save
   his elect.
   John iii. 16; Isa. liii. 6.

   Q. 2. What way was this?

   A. By sending his own Son [43] Jesus Christ in the likeness of sinful
   flesh, condemning sin in the flesh.
   Rom. viii. 3.

   Q. 3. Who is this you call his own Son?

   A. The second person of the Trinity, co-eternal and of the same Deity
   with his Father.
   John i. 14; Rom. i. 3; Gal. iv. 4; 1 John i. 1.

   Q. 4. How did God send him?

   A. By causing him to be made flesh of a pure virgin, and to dwell among
   us, that he might be obedient unto death, the death of the cross.
   Isa. l. 6; John i. 14; Luke i. 35; Phil. ii. 8; 1 Tim. iii. 16.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [43] This is that great mystery of godliness that the angels themselves
   admire; -- the most transcendent expression of God's infinite love, --
   the laying forth of all the treasure of his wisdom and goodness.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. X. -- Of the Person of Jesus Christ.

   Q. 1. What doth the Scripture teach us of Jesus Christ?

   A. Chiefly two things first, his [44] person, or what he is in himself;
   secondly, his offices, or what he is unto us.

   Q. 2. What doth it teach of his person?

   A. That he is truly God, and perfect man, partaker of the natures of
   God and man in one person, between whom he is a Mediator.
   John i. 14; Heb. ii. 14, 15; Eph. iv. 5; 1 Tim. ii. 5; 1 John i. 1.

   Q. 3. How prove you Jesus Christ to be truly God?

   A. Divers ways; first, by places of Scripture, speaking of the great
   God Jehovah in the Old Testament, applied to our Saviour in the New;
   as, Numb. xxi. 5, 6, in 1 Cor. x. 9; Ps. cii. 25-27, in Heb. i. 10;
   Isa. vi. 2-4, in John xii. 40,41; Isa. viii. 13, 14, in Luke ii. 34,
   Rom. ix. 33; Isa. xl. 3, 4, in John i. 23; Isa. xlv. 22, 23, in Rom.
   xiv. 11, Phil. ii. 10, 11; Mal. iii. 1, in Matt. xi. 10.
   Secondly, By the works of the Deity ascribed unto him; as, first, of
   creation, John i. 3; 1 Cor. viii. 6; Heb. i. 2; secondly, of
   preservation in providence, Heb. i. 3; John v. 17; thirdly, miracles.
   Thirdly, By the essential attributes of God being ascribed unto him;
   as, first, immensity, Matt. xxviii. 20; John xiv. 23; Eph. iii. 17;
   secondly, eternity, John i. 1; Rev. i. 11; Mic. v. 2; thirdly,
   immutability, Heb. i. 11, 12; fourthly, omniscience, John xxi. 17; Rev.
   ii. 23; fifthly, majesty and glory equal to his Father, John v. 23;
   Rev. v. 13; Phil. i. 2, ii. 6, 9, 10.
   Fourthly, By the names given unto him; as, first, of God expressly,
   John i. 1, xx. 28; Acts xx. 28; Rom. ix. 5; Phil. ii. 6; Heb. i. 8; 1
   Tim. iii. 16; secondly, of the Son of God, John i. 18; Rom. viii. 3,
   &c.

   Q. 4. Was it necessary that our Redeemer should be God?

   A. Yes; that he might be able to save to the uttermost, and to satisfy
   the wrath of his Father, which no creature could perform.
   Isa xliii. 25, liii. 6; Dan. ix. 17, 19.

   Q. 5. How prove you that he was a perfect man?

   A. First, By the prophecies that went before, that so he should be.
   Gen. iii. 15, xviii. 18.
   Secondly, By the relation of their accomplishment.
   Matt. i. 1; Rom. i. 4; Gal. iv. 4.
   Thirdly, By the Scriptures assigning to him those things which are
   required to a perfect man; as, first, a body, Luke xxiv. 39; Heb. ii.
   17, x. 5; 1 John i. 1; secondly, a soul, Matt. xxvi. 38; Mark xiv. 34;
   and therein, first, a will, Matt. xxvi. 39; secondly, affections, Mark
   iii. 5; Luke x. 21; thirdly, endowments, Luke ii. 52.
   Fourthly, General infirmities of nature.
   Matt. iv. 2; John iv. 6; Heb. ii. 18.

   Q. 6. Wherefore was our Redeemer to be man?

   A. That the nature which had offended might suffer, and make
   satisfaction, and so he might be every way a fit and sufficient Saviour
   for men.
   Heb. ii. 10-17.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [44] 1. Though our Saviour Christ be one God with his Father, he is not
   one person with him. 2. Jesus Christ is God and man in one, -- not a
   God and a man; God incarnate, -- not a man deified. 3. The essential
   properties of either nature remain in his person theirs still, not
   communicated unto the other; as of the Deity to be eternal, everywhere;
   of the humanity to be born and die. 4. Whatever may be said of either
   nature may be said of the whole person; so God may be said to die, but
   not the Godhead; the man Christ to be everywhere, but not his humanity;
   for his one person is all this. 5. The monstrous figment of
   transubstantiation, or Christ's corporeal presence in the sacrament,
   fully overthrows our Saviour's human nature, and makes him a mere
   shadow. 6. All natural properties are double in Christ, -- as will,
   &c., still distinct; all personal, as subsistence, single.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XI. -- Of the Offices of Christ; and, First, of His Kingly.

   Q. 1. How many are the offices of Jesus Christ?

   A. Three; first, of a ^aKing; secondly, of ^ba [45] [46] Priest;
   thirdly, of a ^cProphet.
   ^aPs. ii. 6. ^bPs. cx. 4. ^cDeut. xviii. 15.

   Q. 2. Hath he these offices peculiar by nature?

   A. No; he only received them for the present dispensation, until the
   work of redemption be perfected.
   Ps. cx. 1; Acts ii. 36, x. 42; 1 Cor. xi. 3, xv. 27, 28; Phil. ii. 9;
   Heb. iii. 2, 6, ii. 7-9.

   Q. 3. Wherein doth the kingly office of Christ consist?

   A. In a two-fold power; first, his power of ruling in and over his
   church; secondly, his power of subduing his enemies.
   Ps. cx. 3-7.

   Q. 4. What is his ruling power in and over his people?

   A. That supreme authority which, [47] [48] for their everlasting good,
   he useth towards them, whereof in general there be two acts; first,
   ^ainternal and spiritual, in converting their souls unto him, making
   them unto himself a willing, obedient, persevering people; secondly,
   ^beternal and ecclesiastical, in giving perfect laws and rules for
   their government, as gathered into holy societies under him.
   ^aIsa. liii. 12, lix. 20, 21, with Heb. viii. 10-12; Isa. lxi. 1, 2;
   John i. 16, xii. 32; Mark i. 15; Matt. xxviii. 20; 2 Cor. x. 4, 5.
   ^bMatt. xvi. 19; 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 8-14; 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17;
   Rev. xxii. 18, 19.

   Q. 5. How many are the acts of his kingly power towards his enemies?

   A. Two also first, ^ainternal, by the [49] mighty working of his Word,
   and the spirit of bondage upon their hearts, convincing, amazing,
   terrifying their consciences, hardening their spirits for ruin;
   secondly, ^bexternal, in judgements and vengeance, which ofttimes he
   beginneth in this life, and will continue unto eternity.
   ^aPs. 110; John vi. 46, viii. 59, ix. 41, xii. 40; 2 Cor. x. 4-6; 1
   Cor. v. 5; 1 Tim. i. 20. ^bMark xvi. 16; Luke xix. 27; Acts xiii. 11;
   Rev. xvii. 14.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [45] In the exercise of these offices, Christ is also the sole head,
   husband, God first-born of the church.

   [46] Papal usurpation upon these offices of Christ manifests the pope
   to be the Man of Sin.

   [47] Christ's subjects are all born rebels, and are stubborn, until he
   make them obedient by his Word and Spirit.

   [48] Christ hath not delegated his kingly power of law-making for his
   church to any here below.

   [49] The end of Christ in exercising his kingly power over his enemies,
   is the glory of the gospel and the good of his people.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XII. -- Of Christ's Priestly Office.

   Q. 1. By what means did Jesus Christ undertake the office of an eternal
   priest?

   A. By ^athe decree, ordination, and will of God his Father, ^bwhereunto
   he yielded voluntary obedience; so ^cthat concerning this there was a
   compact and covenant between them.
   ^aPs. cx. 4; Heb. v. 5, 6, vii. 17, 18. ^bIsa. l. 4-6; Heb. x. 5-10.
   ^cPs. ii. 7, 8; Isa. liii. 8, 10-12; Phil. ii. 7, 9; Heb. xii. 2; John
   xvii. 2, 4.

   Q. 2. Wherein doth his execution of this office consist?

   A. In bringing his people unto God.
   Heb. ii. 10, iv. 16, vii. 25.

   Q. 3. What are the parts of it?

   A. First, ^aoblation; secondly, ^bintercession. [50]
   ^aHeb. ix. 14. ^bHeb. vii. 25.

   Q. 4. What is the oblation of Christ?

   A. The ^aoffering up of himself upon the altar of the cross, an holy
   propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of all the elect throughout the
   world; as ^balso, the presentation of himself for us in heaven,
   sprinkled with the blood of the covenant.
   ^aIsa. liii. 10, 12; John iii. 16, xi. 51, xvii. 19; Heb. ix. 13,14.
   ^bHeb. ix. 24.

   Q. 5. Whereby doth this oblation do good unto us?

   A. Divers ways; first, in that it satisfied the justice of God;
   secondly, it redeemed us from the power of sin, death, and hell;
   thirdly, it ratified the new covenant of grace; fourthly, it procured
   for us grace here, and glory hereafter; by all which means the peace
   and reconciliation between God and us is wrought.
   Eph ii. 14, 15.

   Q. 6. How did the oblation of Christ satisfy God's justice for our sin?

   A. In that for us he underwent the [51] punishment due to our sin.
   Isa. liii. 4-6; John x. 11; Rom. iii. 25, 26, iv. 25; 1 Cor. xv. 3; 2
   Cor. v. 21; Eph. v. 2; 1 Pet. ii. 24.

   Q. 7. What was that punishment?

   A. The wrath of God, the curse [52] of the law, the pains of hell, due
   to sinners, in body and soul.
   Gen. ii. 17; Deut. xxvii. 15-26; Isa. lix. 2; Rom. v. 12; Eph ii. 3;
   John iii. 36; Heb. ii. 14.

   Q. 8. Did Christ undergo all these?

   A. Yes; in respect of the greatness [53] and extremity, not the
   eternity and continuance of those pains; for it was impossible he
   should be holden of death.
   Matt. xxvi. 28; Mark xiv. 33, 34; xv. 34; Gal. iii. 13; Eph ii. 16;
   Col. i. 20; Heb. v. 7; Ps. xviii. 5.

   Q. 9. How could the punishment of one satisfy for the offence of all?

   A. In that he was not a mere [54] man only, but God also, of infinitely
   more value than all those who had offended.
   Rom. v. 9; Heb. ix. 26; 1 Pet. iii. 18.

   Q. 10. How did the oblation of Christ redeem from death and hell?

   A. First, ^aby paying a ransom [55] to God, the judge and lawgiver, who
   had condemned us; secondly, ^bby overcoming and spoiling Satan, death,
   and the powers of hell, that detained us captives.
   ^aMatt. xx. 28; John vi. 51; Mark x. 45; Rom. iii. 25; 1 Cor. vi. 20;
   Gal. iii. 13; Eph i. 7; 1 Tim. ii. 6; Heb. x. 9. ^bJohn v. 24; Col. ii.
   13-15; 1 Thess. i. 10; Heb. ii. 14; 1 Pet. i. 18, 19.

   Q. 11. What was the ransom that Christ paid for us?

   A. His own precious blood.
   Acts xx. 28; 1 Pet. i. 19.

   Q. 12. How was the new covenant ratified in his blood?

   A. By being accompanied with [56] his death; for that, as all other
   testaments, was to be ratified by the death of the testator.
   Gen. xxii. 18; Heb. ix. 16, viii. 10-12.

   Q. 13. What is this new covenant?

   A. The gracious, free, ^aimmutable promise of God, made unto all his
   elect fallen in Adam, to ^bgive them Jesus Christ, and ^cin him mercy,
   pardon, grace, and glory, ^dwith a re-stipulation of faith from them
   unto this faith from them unto this promise, and new obedience.
   ^aGen. iii. 15; Jer. xxxi. 31-34, xxxii. 40; Heb. viii. 10-12. ^bGal.
   iii. 8, 16; Gen. xii. 3. ^cRom. viii. 32; Eph. i. 3, 4. ^dMark xvi. 16;
   John i. 12, x. 27, 28.

   Q. 14. How did Christ procure for us grace, faith, and glory?

   A. By the way of purchase [57] and merit; for the death of Christ
   deservedly procured of God that he should bless us with all [58]
   spiritual blessings needful for our coming unto him.
   Isa. liii. 11, 12; John xvii. 2; Acts xx. 28; Rom. v. 17, 18; Eph. ii.
   15, 16, i. 4; Phil. i. 29; Tit. ii. 14; Rev. i. 5, 6.

   Q. 15. What is the intercession of Christ?

   A. His continual soliciting [59] of God on our behalf, begun here in
   fervent prayers, continued in heaven by appearing as our advocate at
   the throne of grace.
   Ps. ii. 8; Rom. viii. 34; Heb. vii. 25, ix. 24, x. 19-21; 1 John ii. 1,
   2; John xvii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [50] Against both these the Papists are exceedingly blasphemous;
   against the one, by making their mass a sacrifice for sins, -- the
   other, by making saints mediators of intercession.

   [51] Christ's undergoing punishment for us was, first, typified by the
   old sacrifices; secondly, foretold in the first promise; thirdly, made
   lawful and valid in itself, -- first, by God's determination, the
   supreme lawgiver; secondly, his own voluntary undergoing it; thirdly,
   by a relaxation of the law in regard of the subject punished; --
   fourthly, beneficial to us, because united to us; as, first, our head;
   secondly, our elder brother; thirdly, our sponsor or surety; fourthly,
   our husband; fifthly, our God, or Redeemer, &c.

   [52] No change in all these, but what necessarily follows the change of
   the persons sustaining.

   [53] The death that Christ underwent was eternal in its own nature and
   tendence, -- not so to him, because of his holiness, power, and the
   unity of his person.

   [54] He suffered not as God, but he suffered who was God.

   [55] We are freed from the anger of God, by a perfect rendering to the
   full value of what he required, -- from the power of Satan, by absolute
   conquest on our behalf.

   [56] The new covenant is Christ's legacy, in his last will unto his
   people, -- the eternal inheritance of glory being conveyed thereby.

   [57] The death of Christ was satisfactory in respect of the strict
   justice of God, -- meritorious in respect of the covenant between him
   and his Father.

   [58] All these holy truths are directly denied by the blasphemous
   Socinians; and by the Papists, with their merits, masses, penance, and
   purgatory, by consequent, overthrown.

   [59] To make saints our intercessors, is to renounce Jesus Christ from
   being a sufficient Saviour.

Chap. XIII. -- Of Christ's Prophetical Office.

   Q. 1. Wherein doth the prophetical office of Christ consist?

   A. In his embassage [60] from God to man, revealing from the bosom of
   his Father the whole mystery of godliness, the way and truth whereby we
   must come unto God.
   Matt. v.; John i. 18, iii. 32, x. 9, 14, xiv. 5, 6, xvii. 8, xviii. 37.

   Q. 2. How doth he exercise this office towards us?

   A. By making known [61] the whole doctrine of truth unto us in a saving
   and spiritual manner.
   Deut. xviii. 18; Isa. xlii. 6; Heb. iii. 1.

   Q. 3. By what means doth he perform all this?

   A. Divers; as, first, ^ainternally and effectually, by his Spirit
   writing his law in our hearts; secondly, ^boutwardly and
   instrumentally, by the Word preached.
   ^aJer. xxxi. 31-34; 2 Cor. iii. 3; 1 Thess. iv. 9; Heb. viii. 10.
   ^bJohn xx. 31; 1 Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 8-13; 2 Pet. i. 21.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] Christ differed from all other prophets; first, in his sending,
   which was immediately from the bosom of his Father; secondly, his
   assistance, which was the fulness of the Spirit; thirdly, his manner of
   teaching, -- with authority.

   [61] To accuse his Word of imperfection, in doctrine or discipline, is
   to deny him a perfect prophet, or to have borne witness unto all truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XIV. -- Of the Two-fold Estate of Christ.

   Q. 1. In what estate or condition doth Christ exercise these offices?

   A. In a two-fold estate; first, of humiliation [62] [63] [64] or
   abasement; secondly, of exaltation or glory.
   Phil. ii. 8-10.

   Q. 2. Wherein consisteth the state of Christ's humiliation?

   A. In three things; first, ^ain his incarnation, or being born of
   woman; secondly, ^bhis obedience, or fulfilling the whole law, moral
   and ceremonial; thirdly, in his ^cpassion, or enduring all sorts of
   miseries, even death itself.
   ^aLuke i. 35; John i. 14; Rom. i. 3; Gal. iv. 4; Heb. ii. 9, 14.
   ^bMatt. iii. 15, v. 17; Luke ii. 21; John viii. 46; 2 Cor. v. 21; 1
   Pet. i. 19; 1 John iii. 5. ^cIsa. liii. 4-6; Heb. ii. 9; 1 Pet. ii. 21.

   Q. 3. Wherein consists his exaltation?

   A. In, first, his resurrection; secondly, ascension; thirdly, sitting
   at the right hand of God; -- by all which he was declared to be the Son
   of God with power.
   Matt. xxviii. 18; Rom. i. 4, vi. 4; Eph. iv. 9; Phil. ii. 9, 10; 1 Tim.
   iii. 16.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] The humiliation of Christ shows us what we must here do and
   suffer, -- his exaltation, what we may hope for.

   [63] The first of these holds forth his mighty love to us; the other
   his mighty power in himself.

   [64] The only way to heaven is by the cross.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XV. -- Of the Persons to whom the Benefits of Christ's Offices do belong.

   Q. 1. Unto whom do the saving benefits of what Christ performeth, in
   the execution of his offices, belong?

   A. Only to his elect. [65] [66] [67]
   John xvii. 9; Isa. lxiii. 9; Heb. iii. 6, x. 21.

   Q. 2. Died he for no other?

   A. None, in respect of his Father's eternal purpose, and his own
   intention of removing wrath from them, and procuring grace and glory
   for them.
   Acts xx. 28; Matt. xx. 28, xxvi. 28; Heb. ix. 28; John xi. 51, 52; Isa.
   liii. 12; John iii. 16, x. 11-13, 15; Eph. v. 25; Rom. viii. 32, 34;
   Gal. iii. 13; John vi. 37, 39; Rom. iv. 25; 2 Cor. v. 19, 20.

   Q. 3. What shall become of them for whom Christ died not?

   A. Everlasting torments for their sins; their portion in their own
   place.
   Mark xvi. 16; John iii. 36; Matt. xxv. 41; Acts i. 25.

   Q. 4. For whom doth he make intercession?

   A. Only for those who from eternity were given him by his Father.
   John xvii.; Heb. vii. 24, 25.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] Christ giveth life to all that world for whom he gave his life.

   [66] None that he died for shall ever die.

   [67] To say that Christ died for every man universally, is to affirm
   that he did no more for the elect than the reprobates, -- for them that
   are saved than for them that are damned; which is the Arminian
   blasphemy.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XVI. -- Of the Church.

   Q. 1. How are the elect called, in respect of their obedience unto
   Christ, and union with him?

   A. His church.
   Acts xx. 28; Eph. v. 32.

   Q. 2. What is the church of Christ?

   A. The whole company of God's [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] elect, ^acalled
   ^bof God, ^cby the Word and Spirit, ^dout of their natural condition,
   to the dignity of his children, and ^eunited unto Christ their head, by
   faith, in the bond of the Spirit.
   ^aActs ii. 47; 1 Tim. v. 21; Heb. xii. 22-24. ^bRom. i. 5, 6, ix. 11,
   24; 1 Cor. iv. 15; 2 Tim. i. 9. ^cActs xvi. 14; John iii. 8; 1 Cor. iv.
   15; 1 Pet. i. 23; Heb. viii. 10. ^dEph. ii. 11-13; Col. i. 13; Heb. ii.
   14, 15; 1 Pet. ii. 9. ^eJohn xvii. 21; Eph. ii. 18-22.

   Q. 3. Is this whole church always in the same state?

   A. No; one part of it is militant, the other triumphant.

   Q. 4. What is the church militant?

   A. That portion of God's elect which, in their generation, cleaveth
   unto Christ by faith, and fighteth against the world, flesh, and devil.
   Eph. vi. 11, 12; Heb. xi. 13, 14, xii. 1, 4.

   Q. 5. What is the church triumphant?

   A. That portion of God's people who, having fought their fight and kept
   the faith, are now in heaven, resting from their labours.
   Eph. v. 27; Rev. iii. 21, xiv. 13.

   Q. 6. Are not the church of the Jews before the birth of Christ, and
   the church of the Christians since, two churches?

   A. No; essentially they are but one, [73] differing only in some
   outward administrations.
   Eph. ii. 11-16; 1 Cor. x. 3; Gal. iv. 26, 27; Heb. xi. 16, 26, 40.

   Q. 7. Can this church be wholly overthrown on the earth?

   A. No; unless the decree of God may be changed, and the promise of
   Christ fail.
   Matt. xvi. 18, xxviii. 20; John xiv. 16; John xvii.; 1 Tim. iii. 15; 2
   Tim. ii. 19.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] The elect angels belong to this church.

   [69] No distance of time or place breaks the unity of this church:
   heaven and earth, from the beginning of the world unto the end, are
   comprised in it.

   [70] No mention in Scripture of any church in purgatory.

   [71] This is the catholic church; -- though that term be not to be
   found in the Word in this sense, the thing itself is obvious.

   [72] The pope, challenging unto himself the title of the head of the
   catholic church, is blasphemously rebellious against Jesus Christ.

   [73] This is that ark out of which whosoever is shall surely perish.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XVII. -- Of Faith.

   Q. 1. By what means do we become actual members of this church of God?

   A. By a lively justifying faith, [74] whereby we are united unto
   Christ, the head thereof.
   Acts ii. 47, xiii. 48; Heb. xi. 6, xii. 22, 23, iv. 2; Rom. v. 1, 2;
   Eph. ii. 13, 14.

   Q. 2. What is a justifying faith?

   A. A ^agracious resting upon [75] the free promises of God in Jesus
   Christ for mercy, ^bwith a firm persuasion of heart that God is a
   reconciled Father unto us in the Son of his love.
   ^a1 Tim. i. 16; Job xiii. 15, xix. 25; Rom. iv. 5. ^bHeb. iv. 16; Rom.
   viii. 38, 39; Gal. ii. 20; 2 Cor. v. 20, 21.

   Q. 3. Have all this faith?

   A. None but the elect of God.
   Tit. i. 1; John x. 26; Matt. xiii. 11; Acts xiii. 48; Rom. viii. 30.

   Q. 4. Do not, then, others believe that make profession?

   A. Yes; with, first, historical faith, or a persuasion that the things
   written in the Word are true, James ii. 19; secondly, temporary faith,
   which hath some joy of the affections, upon unspiritual grounds, in the
   things believed.
   Matt. xiii. 20; Mark vi. 20; John ii. 23, 24; Acts viii. 13.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [74] Of this faith the Holy Spirit is the efficient cause, the Word,
   the instrumental; -- the Law indirectly, by discovering our misery; the
   Gospel immediately, by holding forth a Saviour.

   [75] Faith is in the understanding, in respect of its being and
   subsistence, -- in the will and heart, in respect of its effectual
   working.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XVIII. -- Of our Vocation, or God's Calling us.

   Q. 1. How come we to have this saving faith?

   A. It is freely bestowed upon us and wrought in us by the Spirit of
   God, in our vocation or calling.
   John vi. 29, 44; Eph. ii. 8, 9; Phil. i. 29; 2 Thess. i. 11.

   Q. 2. What is our vocation, or this calling of God?

   A. The free, gracious [76] [77] act of Almighty God, whereby in Jesus
   Christ he calleth and translateth us from the state of nature, sin,
   wrath, and corruption, into the state of grace and union with Christ,
   by the mighty, effectual working of his Spirit in the preaching of the
   Word.
   Col. i. 12, 13; 2 Tim. i. 9; Deut. xxx. 6; Ezek. xxxvi. 26; Matt. xi.
   25, 26; John i. 13, iii. 3, 8; Eph. i. 19; Col. ii. 12; 1 Cor. iv. 7;
   James i. 18; 2 Pet. ii. 20; Acts xvi. 14.

   Q. 3. What do we ourselves perform in this change, or work of our
   conversion?

   A. Nothing at all, being merely [78] wrought upon by the free grace and
   Spirit of God, when in ourselves we have no ability to any thing that
   is spiritually good.
   Matt. vii. 18, x. 20; John i. 13, xv. 5; 1 Cor. xii. 3, ii. 5; 2 Cor.
   iii. 5; Eph ii. 1, 8; Rom. viii. 26; Phil. i. 6.

   Q. 4. Doth God thus call all and every one?

   A. All within the pale of the church are outwardly called by the Word,
   none effectually but the elect.
   Matt. xxii. 14; Rom. viii. 30.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [76] Our effectual calling is the first effect of our everlasting
   election.

   [77] We have no actual interest in nor right unto Christ, until we are
   thus called.

   [78] They who so boast of the strength of free-will in the work of our
   conversion are themselves an example what it is being given up to so
   vile an error, -- destitute of the grace of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XIX. -- Of Justification.

   Q. 1. Are we accounted righteous and saved for our faith, when we are
   thus freely called?

   A. No, but merely by the imputation of the righteousness of Christ,
   apprehended and applied by faith; for which alone the Lord accepts us
   as holy and righteous.
   Isa. xliii. 25; Rom. iii. 23-26, iv. 5.

   Q. 2. What, then, is our justification or righteousness before God?

   A. The gracious, free act [79] of God, imputing the righteousness of
   Christ to a believing sinner, and for that speaking peace unto his
   conscience, in the pardon of his sin, -- pronouncing him to be just and
   accepted before him.
   Gen. xv. 6; Acts xiii. 38, 39; Luke xviii. 14; Rom. iii. 24, 26, 28,
   iv. 4-8; Gal. ii. 16.

   Q. 3. Are we not, then, righteous before God by our own works?

   A. No; for of themselves they can neither satisfy his justice, fulfil
   his law, nor endure his trial.
   Ps. cxxx. 3, 4, cxliii. 2; Isa. lxiv. 6; Luke xvii. 10.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [79] Legal and evangelical justification differ; first, on the part of
   the persons to be justified, -- the one requiring a person legally and
   perfectly righteous, -- the other a believing sinner; secondly, on the
   part of God, who in the one is a severe, righteous judge, -- in the
   other, a merciful, reconciled Father; thirdly, in the sentence, which
   in the one acquitteth, as having done nothing amiss, -- in the other,
   as having all amiss pardoned.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XX. -- Of Sanctification.

   Q. 1. Is there nothing, then, required of us but faith only?

   A. Yes; ^arepentance, and ^bholiness or new obedience.
   ^aActs xx. 21; Matt. iii. 2; Luke xiii. 3. ^b2 Tim. ii. 19; 1 Thess.
   iv. 7; Heb. xii. 14.

   Q. 2. What is repentance?

   A. Godly ^asorrow for every known [80] [81] sin committed against God,
   ^bwith a firm purpose of heart to cleave unto him for the future, ^cin
   the killing of sin, the quickening of all graces, to walk before him in
   newness of life.
   ^a2 Cor. vii. 9-11; Acts ii. 37; Ps. li. 17. ^bPs. xxxiv. 14; Isa. i.
   16, 17; Ezek. xviii. 27, 28; Acts xiv. 15. ^cEph. iv. 21-24; Rom. vi.
   12, 13, 18, 19, viii. 1; 2 Cor. v. 17; Gal. vi. 15.

   Q. 3. Can we do this of ourselves?

   A. No; it is a special gift and grace of God, which he bestoweth on
   whom he pleaseth.
   Lev. xx. 8; Deut. xxx. 6; Ezek. xi. 19, 20; 2 Tim. ii. 25; Acts xi. 18.

   Q. 4. Wherein doth the being of true repentance consist, without which
   it is not acceptable?

   A. In its [82] performance according to the Gospel rule, with faith and
   assured hope of divine mercy.
   Ps. li.; 1 John ii. 1, 2; 2 Cor. vii. 10, 11; Acts ii. 38; Matt. xxvi.
   75.

   Q. 5. What is that holiness which is required of us?

   A. That ^auniversal, [83] [84] sincere obedience to the whole will of
   God, ^bin our hearts, minds, wills, and actions, ^cwhereby we are in
   some measure made conformable to Christ, our head.
   ^aPs. cxix. 9; 1 Sam. xv. 22; John xiv. 15; Rom. vi. 19; Heb. xii. 14;
   Tit. ii. 12; 2 Pet. i. 5-7; Isa. i. 16, 17. ^b1 Chron. xxviii. 9; Deut.
   vi. 5; Matt. xxii. 37. ^cRom. viii. 29; 1 Cor. xi. 1; Eph. ii. 21; Col.
   iii. 1-3; 2 Tim. ii. 11, 12.

   Q. 6. Is this holiness or obedience in us perfect?

   A. Yes, ^ain respect [85] of all the parts of it, but ^bnot in respect
   of the degrees wherein God requires it.
   ^a2 Kings xx. 3; Job i. 1; Matt. v. 48; Luke i. 6; 2 Cor. vii. 1; Eph.
   iv. 24; Tit. ii. 12. ^bIsa lxiv. 6; Ps. cxxx. 3; Exod. xxviii. 38;
   Phil. iii. 12.

   Q. 7. Will God accept of that obedience which falls so short of what he
   requireth?

   A. Yes, from them [86] whose persons he accepteth and justifieth freely
   in Jesus Christ.
   Rom. xii. 1; Phil. iv. 18; Heb. xiii. 16; 1 John iii. 22; Eph. i. 6.

   Q. 8. What are the parts of this holiness?

   A. ^aInternal, in the quickening of all graces, purging all sins; ^band
   external, in fervent and frequent prayers, alms, and all manner of
   righteousness. Particular precepts are innumerable.
   ^aHeb. ix. 14; Eph. iii. 16, 17; Rom. ii. 29, vi. 12. ^bMatt. v. 20;
   Rom. viii. 1, 2; Eph iv. 22, 23; Tit. ii. 12.

   Q. 9. May not others perform these duties acceptably, as well as those
   that believe?

   A. No; [87] all their performances in this kind are but abominable sins
   before the Lord.
   Prov. xv. 8; John ix. 31; Tit. i. 15; Heb. xi. 6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [80] Repentance includeth, first, alteration of the mind into a hatred
   of sin, before loved; secondly, sorrow of the affections for sin
   committed; thirdly, change of the actions arising from both.

   [81] Repentance is either legal, servile, and terrifying, from the
   spirit of bondage; or evangelical, filial, and comforting, from the
   spirit of free grace and liberty, which only is available.

   [82] Every part of Popish repentance -- viz., contrition, confession,
   and satisfaction -- was performed by Judas.

   [83] All faith and profession, without this holiness, is vain and of no
   effect.

   [84] True faith can no more be without true holiness than true fire
   without heat.

   [85] Merit of works in unprofitable servants, no way able to do their
   duty, is a Popish miracle.

   [86] In Christ are our persons accepted freely, and for him our
   obedience.

   [87] The best duties of unbelievers are but white sins.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XXI. -- Of the Privileges of Believers.

   Q. 1. What are the privileges of those that thus believe and repent?

   A. First, union with Christ; secondly, adoption of children; thirdly,
   Christian liberty; fourthly, a spiritual, holy right to the seals of
   the new covenant; fifthly, communion with all saints; sixthly,
   resurrection of the body unto life eternal.

   Q. 2. What is our union with Christ?

   A. An ^aholy, spiritual [88] [89] conjunction unto him, as our ^bhead,
   ^chusband, and ^dfoundation, ^ewhereby we are made partakers of the
   same Spirit with him, ^fand derive all good things from him.
   ^a1 Cor. xii. 12; John xv. 1, 2, 5-7, xvii. 23. ^bEph. iv. 15, v. 23;

   Phil. i. 19. ^fJohn i. 12, 16; Eph. i. 3.

   Q. 3. What is our adoption?

   A. Our gracious reception into the family of God, as his children, and
   co-heirs with Christ.
   John i. 12; Rom. viii. 15, 17; Gal. iv. 5; Eph. i. 5.

   Q. 4. How come we to know this?

   A. By the especial working of the Holy [90] Spirit in our hearts,
   sealing unto us the promises of God, and raising up our souls to an
   assured expectation of the promised inheritance.
   Rom. viii. 15, 17; Eph. iv. 30; 1 John iii. 1; Rom. viii. 19, 23; Tit.
   ii. 13.

   Q. 5. What is our Christian liberty?

   A. An [91] holy and spiritual ^afreedom from the ^bslavery of sin, the
   ^cbondage of death and hell, the ^dcurse of the law, ^eJewish
   ceremonies, and ^fthraldom of conscience, purchased for us by Jesus
   Christ, and ^grevealed to us by the Holy Spirit.

   Q. 6. Are we, then, wholly freed from the moral law?

   A. Yes, as ^aa covenant, [92] or as it hath any thing in it bringing
   into bondage, -- as the curse, power, dominion, and rigid exaction of
   obedience; ^bbut not as it is a rule of life and holiness.
   ^aJer. xxxi. 31-33; Rom. vii. 1-3, vi. 14; Gal. iii. 19, 24; Rom. viii.
   2; Gal. v. 18. ^bMatt. v. 17; Rom. iii. 31, vii. 13, 22, 25.

   Q. 7. Are we not freed by Christ from the magistrate's power and human
   authority?

   A. No; being ordained of [93] God, and commanding for him, we owe them
   all lawful obedience.
   Rom. xiii. 1-4; 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2; 1 Pet. ii. 13-15.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [88] By virtue of this union, Christ suffereth in our afflictions; and
   we fill up in our bodies what remaineth as his.

   [89] From Christ, as head of the church, we have spiritual life, sense,
   and motion, or growth in grace; secondly, as the husband of the church,
   love and redemption; thirdly, as the foundation thereof, stability and
   perseverance.

   [90] This is that great honour and dignity of believers, which exalts
   them to a despising all earthly thrones.

   [91] Our liberty is our inheritance here below, which we ought to
   contend for, against all opposers.

   [92] Nothing makes men condemn the law as a rule, but hatred of that
   universal holiness which it doth require.

   [93] Rule and authority are as necessary for human society as fire and
   water for our lives.

Chap. XXII. -- Of the Sacraments of the New Covenant in particular, -- a holy
right whereunto is the Fourth Privilege of Believers.

   Q. 1. What are the seals of the New Testament?

   A. Sacraments instituted of Christ to be visible seals and pledges,
   whereby God in him confirmeth the promises of the covenant to all
   believers, re-stipulating of them growth in faith and obedience.
   Mark xvi. 16; John iii. 5; Acts ii. 38, xxii. 16; Rom. iv. 11; 1 Cor.
   x. 2-4, xi. 26-29.

   Q. 2. How doth God by these sacraments bestow grace upon us?

   A. Not by any [94] real essential conveying of spiritual grace by
   corporeal means, but by the way of promise, obsignation, and covenant,
   confirming the grace wrought in us by the Word and Spirit.
   Heb. iv. 2; 1 Cor. x.; Rom. iv. 11, i. 17; Mark xvi. 16; Eph. v. 26.

   Q. 3. How do our sacraments differ from the sacraments of the Jews?

   A. Accidentally only, in things concerning the outward matter and form,
   as their number, quality, clearness of signification, and the like, not
   essentially, in the things signified, or grace confirmed.
   1 Cor. x. 1, 2, 3, &c.; John vi. 35; 1 Cor. v. 7; Phil. iii. 3; Col.
   ii. 11.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [94] This is one of the greatest mysteries of the Roman magic and
   juggling that corporeal elements should have a power to forgive sins,
   and confer spiritual grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XXIII. -- Of Baptism.

   Q. 1. Which are these sacraments?

   A. Baptism and the Lord's supper.

   Q. 2. What is baptism?

   A. An ^aholy action, appointed [95] [96] of Christ, whereby being the
   sprinkled with water in name of the whole Trinity, by a lawful minister
   of the church, ^bwe are admitted into the family of God, ^cand have the
   benefits of the blood of Christ confirmed unto us.
   ^aMatt. xxviii. 19; Mark xvi. 15, 16. ^bActs ii. 41, viii. 37. ^cActs
   ii. 38, 39; John iii. 5; Rom. vi. 3-5; 1 Cor. xii. 13.

   Q. 3. To whom doth this sacrament belong?

   A. Unto all to whom the promise of the covenant is made; that is, to
   believers, and to their seed.
   Acts ii. 39; Gen. xvii. 11, 12; Acts xvi. 15; Rom. iv. 10, 11; 1 Cor.
   vii. 14.

   Q. 4. How can baptism seal the pardon of all sins to us, all our
   personal sins following it?

   A. Inasmuch as it is a seal of that promise which gives pardon of all
   to believers.
   Acts ii. 39; Rom. iv. 11, 12.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [95] Not the want, but the contempt of this sacrament, is damnable.

   [96] It is hard to say whether the error of the Papists, requiring
   baptism of absolute, indispensable necessity to the salvation of every
   infant, or that of the Anabaptists, debarring them from it altogether,
   be the most uncharitable.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chap. XXIV. -- Of the Lord's Supper.

   Q. 1. What is the Lord's supper?

   A. An ^aholy action instituted and [97] appointed by Christ, ^bto set
   forth his death, ^cand communicate unto us spiritually his body and
   blood by faith, being ^drepresented by bread and wine, ^eblessed by his
   word, and prayer, ^fbroken, [98] poured out, and received of believers.
   ^aMatt. xxvi. 26-28; Luke xxii. 14-20; 1 Cor. xi. 23-25. ^bLuke xxii.
   19; 1 Cor. xi. 25, 26. ^cMark xiv. 22-24; 1 Cor. xi. 24, 25; John vi.
   63. ^d1 Cor. xi. 23, 25. ^e1 Cor. xi. 24; Matt. xxvi. 26. ^fMatt. xxvi.
   26; Mark xiv. 22; Luke xxii. 19.

   Q. 2. When did Christ appoint this sacraments?

   A. On the night wherein he was betrayed to suffer.
   1 Cor. xi. 23.

   Q. 3. Whence is the right use of it to be learned?

   A. From the word, [99] practice, and actions of our Saviour, at its
   institution.

   Q. 4. What were the actions of our Saviour to be imitated by us?

   A. First, blessing the elements by prayer; secondly, breaking the
   bread, and pouring out the wine; thirdly, distributing them to the
   receivers, sitting in a table-gesture.
   Matt. xxvi. 26; Mark xiv. 22; Luke xxii. 19,20; 1 Cor. xi. 23, 24.

   Q. 5. What were the words of Christ?

   A. First, of command, -- "Take, eat;" secondly, of promise, -- "This is
   my body;" thirdly, of institution for perpetual use, -- "This do," &c.
   1 Cor. xi. 24-26.

   Q. 6. Who are to be [100] [101] receivers of this sacrament?

   A. Those only have a true right to the signs who by faith have an holy
   interest in Christ, the thing signified.
   1 Cor. xi. 27-29; John vi. 63.

   Q. 7. Do the elements remain bread and wine still, after the blessing
   of them?

   A. Yes; all the spiritual change is wrought by the faith of the
   receiver, not the words of the giver: to them that believe, they are
   the body and blood of Christ.
   John vi. 63; 1 Cor. x. 4, xi. 29.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [97] Baptism is the sacrament of our new birth, this of our farther
   growth in Christ.

   [98] No part of Christian religion was ever so vilely contaminated and
   abused by profane wretches, as this pure, holy, plain action and
   institution of our Saviour: witness the Popish horrid monster of
   transubstantiation, and their idolatrous mass.

   [99] Whatever is more than these, is of our own.

   [100] Faith in God's promises, which it doth confirm, -- union with
   Christ, whereof it is a seal, -- and obedience to the right use of the
   ordinance itself, -- are required of all receivers.

   [101] There is not any one action pertaining to the spiritual nature of
   this sacrament, not any end put upon it by Christ, -- as, first, the
   partaking of his body and blood; secondly, setting forth his death for
   us; thirdly, declaring of our union with him and his, -- but requires
   faith, grace, and holiness, in the receivers.

Chap. XXV. -- Of the Communion of Saints, -- the Fifth Privilege of Believers.

   Q. 1. What is the communion of saints?

   A. An holy conjunction [102] between all God's people, wrought by their
   participation of the same Spirit, whereby we are all made members of
   that one body whereof Christ is the head.
   Cant. vi. 9; Jer. xxxii. 39; John xvii. 22; 1 Cor. xii. 12; Eph iv.
   3-6, 13; 1 John i. 3, 6, 7.

   Q. 2. Of what sort is this union?

   A. First, ^aspiritual and internal, in the enjoyment of the same spirit
   and graces, -- which is the union of the church catholic; secondly,
   ^bexternal and ecclesiastical, in the same outward ordinances, -- which
   is the union of particular congregations.
   ^a1 Cor. xii. 12, 13; Eph ii. 16, 19-22; 1 Cor. x. 17; John xvii. 11,
   21, 22; John x. 16; Heb. ii. 11. ^b1 Cor. i. 10, 11; Rom. xii. 5; 1
   Cor. xii. 27, 28; Eph iv. 11-13; Phil. ii. 2; Col. iii. 15; 1 Pet. iii.
   8.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [102] By virtue of this, we partake in all the good and evil of the
   people of God throughout the world.

Chap. XXVI. -- Of Particular Churches.

   Q. 1. What are particular churches?

   A. Peculiar ^aassemblies [103] [104] of professors in one place,

   God, ^dand leading lives beseeming their holy calling.
   ^aActs xi. 26; 1 Cor. iv. 17, xi. 22; 2 Cor. i. 1. ^bActs xx. 17, 28,
   xiv. 23; 2 Cor. viii. 23; Heb. xiii. 17. ^c1 Cor. iii. 5; Rev. ii. 1-3.
   ^d2 Thess. iii. 5, 6, 11; Gal. vi. 16; Phil. iii. 17; 1 Thess. ii. 12.

   Q. 2. What are the ordinary officers of such churches?

   A. First, ^apastors or doctors, [105] to teach and exhort; secondly,
   ^belders, to assist in rule and government; thirdly, ^cdeacons, to
   provide for the poor.
   ^aRom. xii. 7, 8; Eph. iv. 11; 1 Cor. xii. 28. ^bRom. xii. 8; 1 Tim. v.
   17. ^cActs vi. 2, 3.

   Q. 3. What is required of these officers, especially the chiefest, or
   ministers?

   A. ^aThat they be faithful in the ministry committed unto them;
   ^bsedulous in dispensing the Word; ^cwatching for the good of the souls
   committed to them; ^dgoing before them in an example of all godliness

   16.

   Q. 4. What is required in the people unto them?

   A. Obedience ^ato their message and ministry; ^bhonour and love to

   ^a2 Cor. v. 20; Rom. vi. 17; Heb. xiii. 17; 2 Thess. iii. 14; Rom. xvi.
   19; 2 Cor. x. 4-6. ^b1 Cor. iv. 1; Gal. iv. 14; 1 Tim. v. 17, 18.
   ^cLuke x. 7; James v. 4; 1 Tim. v. 17, 18; 1 Cor. ix. 9-13.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [103] Every corruption doth not presently unchurch a people.

   [104] Unholiness of fellow-worshippers defileth not God's ordinances.

   [105] Ministers are the bishops of the Lord; lord-bishops came from
   Rome.

Chap. XXVII. -- Of the Last Privilege of Believers, -- being the Door of
Entrance into Glory.

   Q. 1. What is the resurrection of the flesh?

   A. An act of the [106] mighty power of God's Holy Spirit, applying unto
   us the virtue of Christ's resurrection, &c; whereby, at the last day,
   he will raise our whole bodies from the dust, to be united again unto
   our souls in everlasting happiness.
   Job xix. 25-27; Ps. xvi. 9-11; Isa. xxvi. 19; Ezek. xxxvii. 2, 3; Dan.
