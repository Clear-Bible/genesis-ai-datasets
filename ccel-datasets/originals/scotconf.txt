Publisher's Introduction

   In 1559, John Knox returned to his homeland, marking a new effort in
   the battle to reform Scotland. Throughout the nation, Protestants
   joined together in a solemn covenant, pledging their lives and fortunes
   for the cause of Christ.

   The Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, was a hardened Papist, and she opposed
   all endeavours to reform Scotland. The Queen Regent died in 1560, and
   the Scottish Parliament convened in Edinburgh in August, to address
   many issues confronting the restless nation.

   In the History of the Reformation in Scotland, Knox gives a record of
   the drama which unfolded. A supplication was laid before the Parliament
   by the Protestant nobility, decrying the corruptions of Roman
   Catholicism, and seeking the abolition of Popery. The petition of the
   Protestants exclaimed, "We offer ourselves to prove, that in all the
   [rabble of the clergy] there is not one lawful minister, if God's word,
   the practice of the apostles, and their own ancient laws shall judge of
   lawful election. We further offer ourselves to prove them all thieves
   and murderers: yea, rebels and traitors to the lawful authority of
   empires, kings, and princes; and therefore unworthy to be suffered in
   any reformed commonwealth." [1]

   In response, the Parliament directed the Protestant noblemen and
   ministers to draw up "in plain and several heads, the sum of that
   doctrine which they would maintain, and would desire that present
   Parliament to establish as wholesome, true, and only necessary to be
   believed and received within that realm." [2]

   Over the next four days, the Scottish Confession was drafted by six
   ministers: John Winram, John Spottiswoode, John Willock, John Douglas,
   John Row, and John Knox. On 17 August 1560, the document was read
   twice, article by article, before the Parliament; and the Protestant
   ministers stood ready to defend the cause of truth, in the event that
   any article of belief was assailed.

   When the vote was taken, the Confession was ratified, with only a few
   dissenting voices, who "yet for their dissenting could produce no
   better reason but, 'We will believe as our fathers believed.' The
   bishops (papistical, we mean), spake nothing." [3]

   The Scottish Confession of 1560 is a lively testimony to the truth. The
   Church of Scotland approved the Westminster Standards over 80 years
   later; but the ratification of the Westminster Standards was in no way
   a repudiation of the previous testimony of the Church. Rather, the
   combined documents present a united testimony respecting the doctrinal
   landmarks of the Protes tant Reformation. And since the latter
   standards are among the offspring of the former Confession, all persons
   of the Reformed faith should find it profitable to study the Scottish
   Confession of 1560.

                        The Scottish Confession of Faith

   And these glad tidings of the kingdom shall be preached through the
   whole world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end
   come.

   Matthew 24:14

The Preface

   The Estates of Scotland, with the inhabitants of the same, professing
   Christ Jesus' holy evangel: to their natural countrymen, and unto all
   other realms and nations, professing the same Lord Jesus with them,
   wish grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, with the spirit of righteous judgment, for salutation, etc.

   Long have we thirsted, dear brethren, to have notified unto the world
   the sum of that doctrine which we profess, and for the which we have
   sustained infamy and danger. But such has been the rage of Satan
   against us, and against Christ Jesus' eternal verity lately born
   amongst us, that to this day no time has been granted unto us to clear
   our consciences, as most gladly we would have done. For how we have
   been tossed a whole year past, the most part of Europe (as we suppose)
   does understand. But seeing that of the infinite goodness of our God
   (who never suffers his afflicted utterly to be confounded), above
   expectation, we have obtained some rest and liberty, we could not but
   set forth this brief and plain confession of such doctrine as is
   proponed unto us, and as we believe and profess; partly for
   satisfaction of our brethren, whose hearts, we doubt not, have been and
   yet are wounded by the despiteful railing of such as yet have not
   learned to speak well; and partly for stopping of the mouths of
   impudent blasphemers, who boldly damn that which they have neither
   heard, nor yet understand.

   Not that we judge that the cankered malice of such is able to be cured
   by this our simple confession. No, we know that the sweet savour of the
   evangel is, and shall be, death unto the sons of perdition. But we have
   chief respect to our weak and infirm brethren, to whom we would
   communicate the bottom of our hearts, lest that they be troubled or
   carried away by diversity of rumors, which Satan spreads contrary
   [against] us, to the defeating of this our most godly enterprise;
   protesting that, if any man will note in this our confession any
   article or sentence repugning to God's holy word, that it would please
   him of his gentleness, and for Christian charity's sake, to admonish us
   of the same in writing; and we, of our honour and fidelity, do promise
   unto him satisfaction from the mouth of God (that is, from his holy
   scriptures), or else reformation of that which he shall prove to be
   amiss. For God we take to record in our consciences, that from our
   hearts we abhor all sects of heresy, and all teachers of erroneous
   doctrine; and that, with all humility, we embrace the purity of
   Christ's evangel, which is the only food of our souls; and therefore so
   precious unto us, that we are determined to suffer the extremity of
   worldly danger, rather than that we will suffer ourselves to be
   defrauded of the same. For hereof we are most certainly persuaded, that
   whosoever denies Christ Jesus, or is ashamed of him in presence of men,
   shall be denied before the Father, and before his holy angels. And
   therefore, by the assistance of the mighty Spirit of the same our Lord
   Jesus, we firmly purpose to abide to the end, in the confession of this
   our faith, as by articles follows.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 1. Of God

   We confess and acknowledge one only God, to whom only we must cleave,
   whom only we must serve, whom only we must worship, and in whom only we
   must put our trust: [4] who is eternal, infinite, immeasurable,
   incomprehensible, omnipotent, invisible; [5] one in substance, and yet
   distinct in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; [6]
   by whom we confess and believe all things in heaven and in earth, as
   well visible as invisible, to have been created, to be retained in
   their being, and to be ruled and guided by his inscrutable Providence,
   to such end as his eternal wisdom, goodness, and justice has appointed
   them, to the manifestation of his own glory. [7]

Chapter 2. Of the Creation of Man

   We confess and acknowledge this our God to have created man (to wit,
   our first father Adam) to his own image and similitude, to whom he gave
   wisdom, lordship, justice, free will, and clear knowledge of himself;
   so that in the whole nature of man there could be noted no
   imperfection: [8] from which honour and perfection man and woman did
   both fall; the woman being deceived by the serpent, and man obeying the
   voice of the woman: both conspiring against the Sovereign Majesty of
   God, who in expressed words had before threatened death, if they
   presumed to eat of the forbidden tree. [9]

Chapter 3. Of Original Sin

   By which transgression, commonly called Original Sin, was the image of
   God utterly defaced in man; and he and his posterity of nature became
   enemies to God, slaves to Satan, and servants to sin; [10] insomuch
   that death everlasting has had, and shall have, power and dominion over
   all that have not been, are not, or shall not be regenerated from
   above: which regeneration is wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost,
   working in the hearts of the elect of God an assured faith in the
   promise of God, revealed to us in his word; by which faith we apprehend
   Christ Jesus, with the graces and benefits promised in him. [11]

Chapter 4. Of the Revelation of the Promise

   For this we constantly believe: that God, after the fearful and
   horrible defection of man from his obedience, did seek Adam again, call
   upon him, [12] rebuke his sin, convict him of the same, and in the end
   made unto him a most joyful promise: to wit, that the seed of the woman
   should break down the serpent's head [13]  that is, he should destroy
   the works of the Devil. Which promise, as it was repeated and made more
   clear from time to time, so was it embraced with joy, and most
   constantly received of all the faithful, from Adam to Noah, from Noah
   to Abraham, from Abraham to David, and so forth to the incarnation of
   Christ Jesus: all (we mean the faithful fathers) under the law did see
   the joyful days of Christ Jesus, and did rejoice. [14]

Chapter 5. The Continuance, Increase, and Preservation of the Kirk

   We most constantly believe that God preserved, instructed, multiplied,
   honoured, decored, and from death called to life his kirk in all ages,
   from Adam, till the coming of Christ Jesus in the flesh. [15] For
   Abraham he called from his father's country; him he instructed; his
   seed he multiplied; [16] the same he marvelously preserved, and more
   marvelously delivered from the bondage and tyranny of Pharaoh; [17] to
   them he gave his laws, constitutions, and ceremonies; [18] them he
   possessed in the land of Canaan; [19] to them, after Judges and after
   Saul, he gave David to be king, to whom he made promise, that of the
   fruit of his loins should one sit for ever upon his regal seat. [20] To
   this same people, from time to time, he sent prophets to reduce them to
   the right way of their God, [21] from the which often times they
   declined by idolatry. And albeit for their stubborn contempt of
   justice, he was compelled to give them in the hands of their enemies,
   [22] as before was threatened by the mouth of Moses, [23] insomuch that
   the holy city was destroyed, the temple burnt with fire, [24] and the
   whole land left desolate the space of seventy years; [25] yet of mercy
   did he reduce them again to Jerusalem, where the city and temple were
   reedified, and they, against all temptations and assaults of Satan, did
   abide till the Messiah came, according to the promise. [26]

Chapter 6. Of the Incarnation of Christ Jesus

   When the fulness of time came, God sent his Son [27]  his Eternal
   Wisdom, the substance of his own glory, in this world  who took the
   nature of manhood of the substance of woman: to wit, of a virgin, and
   that by operation of the Holy Ghost. [28] And so was born the just seed
   of David, the angel of the great counsel of God; the very Messiah
   promised, whom we confess and acknowledge Immanuel; very God and very
   man, two perfect natures united and joined in one person. [29] By which
   our confession we damn the damnable and pestilent heresies of Arius,
   Marcion, Eutyches, Nestorius, and such others as either deny the
   eternity of his Godhead, or the verity of his human nature, either
   confound them, either yet divide them.

Chapter 7. Why It Behoved the Mediator to be Very God and Very Man

   We acknowledge and confess that this most wondrous conjunction betwixt
   the Godhead and the manhood in Christ Jesus did proceed from the
   eternal and immutable decree of God, whence also our salvation springs
   and depends. [30]

Chapter 8. Election

   For that same Eternal God and Father, who of mere grace elected us in
   Christ Jesus his Son, before the foundation of the world was laid, [31]
   appointed him to be our Head, [32] our Brother, [33] our Pastor, and
   great Bishop of our souls. [34] But because that the enmity betwixt the
   justice of God and our sins was such that no flesh by itself could or
   might have attained unto God, [35] it behoved that the Son of God
   should descend unto us, and take himself a body of our body, flesh of
   our flesh, and bone of our bones, and so become the perfect Mediator
   betwixt God and man; [36] giving power to so many as believe in him to
   be the sons of God, [37] as himself does witness: I pass up to my
   Father and unto your Father, to my God, and unto your God. [38] By
   which most holy fraternity, whatsoever we have lost in Adam is restored
   to us again. [39] And for this cause are we not afraid to call God our
   Father, [40] not so much that [because] he has created us (which we
   have common with the reprobate), [41] as for that he has given to us
   his only Son to be our brother, [42] and given unto us grace to
   acknowledge and embrace him for our only Mediator, as before is said.

   It behoved further the Messiah and Redeemer to be very God and very
   Man, because he was to underlie the punishment due for our
   transgressions, and to present himself in the presence of his Father's
   judgments, as in our person, to suffer for our transgression and
   disobedience, [43] by death, to overcome him that was author of death.
   But because the only Godhead could not suffer death, [44] neither yet
   could the only manhead overcome the same, he joined both together in
   one person, that the imbecility [weakness] of the one should suffer,
   and be subject to death (which we had deserved), and the infinite and
   invincible power of the other (to wit, of the Godhead) should triumph
   and purchase to us life, liberty, and perpetual victory. [45] And so we
   confess, and most undoubtedly believe.

Chapter 9. Christ's Death, Passion, Burial, etc.

   [We confess] That our Lord Jesus Christ offered himself a voluntary
   sacrifice unto his Father for us; [46] that he suffered contradiction
   of sinners; that he was wounded and plagued for our transgressions;
   [47] that he, being the clean and innocent Lamb of God, [48] was damned
   in the presence of an earthly judge, [49] that we should be absolved
   before the tribunal seat of our God; [50] that he suffered not only the
   cruel death of the cross (which was accursed by the sentence of God),
   [51] but also that he suffered for a season the wrath of his Father,
   [52] which sinners had deserved. But yet we avow, that he remained the
   only and well-beloved and blessed Son of his Father, even in the midst
   of his anguish and torment, which he suffered in body and soul, to make
   the full satisfaction for the sins of the people. [53] After the which,
   we confess and avow, that there remains no other sacrifice for sin:
   [54] which if any affirm, we nothing doubt to avow that they are
   blasphemers against Christ's death, and the everlasting purgation and
   satisfaction purchased to us by the same.

Chapter 10. Resurrection

   We undoubtedly believe that, insomuch as it was impossible that the
   dolours of death should retain in bondage the Author of life; [55] that
   our Lord Jesus Christ crucified, dead, and buried, who descended into
   hell, did rise again for our justification, [56] and destroying him who
   was the author of death, brought life again to us that were subject to
   death and to the bondage of the same. [57] We know that his
   resurrection was confirmed by the testimony of his very enemies; [58]
   by the resurrection of the dead, whose sepulchres did open, and they
   did arise and appear to many within the city of Jerusalem. [59] It was
   also confirmed by the testimony of angels, [60] and by the senses and
   judgments of his apostles, and of others, who had conversation, and did
   eat and drink with him after his resurrection. [61]

Chapter 11. Ascension

   We nothing doubt but that the selfsame body, which was born of the
   virgin, was crucified, dead, and buried, and which did rise again, did
   ascend into the heavens, for the accomplishment of all things; [62]
   where, in our names, and for our comfort he has received all power in
   heaven and in earth, [63] where he sits at the right hand of the Father
   inaugurated in his kingdom, Advocate and only Mediator for us: [64]
   which glory, honour, and prerogative he alone amongst the brethren
   shall possess, till that all his enemies be made his footstool, [65] as
   that we undoubtedly believe they shall be in the final judgment; to the
   execution whereof we certainly believe that the same our Lord Jesus
   shall visibly return, as that he was seen to ascend. [66] And then we
   firmly believe, that the time of refreshing and restitution of all
   things shall come, [67] insomuch that those that from the beginning
   have suffered violence, injury, and wrong for righteousness' sake,
   shall inherit that blessed immortality promised from the beginning.
   [68]

   But contrariwise, the stubborn, disobedient, cruel oppressors, filthy
   persons, idolaters, and all sorts of unfaithful shall be cast in the
   dungeon of utter darkness, where their worm shall not die, neither yet
   their fire shall be extinguished. [69] The remembrance of which day,
   and of the judgment to be executed in the same, is not only to us a
   bridle, whereby our carnal lusts are refrained; but also such
   inestimable comfort, that neither may the threatening of worldly
   princes, neither yet the fear of temporal death and present danger,
   move us to renounce and forsake that blessed society, which we, the
   members, have with our Head and only Mediator Christ Jesus: [70] whom
   we confess and avow to be the Messiah promised, the only Head of his
   kirk, our just Lawgiver, our only High Priest, Advocate, and Mediator.
   [71] In which honours and offices, if man or angel presume to intrude
   themselves, we utterly detest and abhor them, as blasphemous to our
   Sovereign and Supreme Governor, Christ Jesus.

Chapter 12. Faith in the Holy Ghost

   This our faith, and the assurance of the same, proceeds not from flesh
   and blood, that is to say, from no natural powers within us, but is the
   inspiration of the Holy Ghost: [72] whom we confess God, equal with the
   Father and with the Son; [73] who sanctifies us, and brings us in all
   verity by his own operation; without whom we should remain for ever
   enemies to God, and ignorant of his Son, Christ Jesus. For of nature we
   are so dead, so blind and so perverse, that neither can we feel when we
   are pricked, see the light when it shines, nor assent to the will of
   God when it is revealed, unless the Spirit of the Lord Jesus quicken
   that which is dead, remove the darkness from our minds, and bow our
   stubborn hearts to the obedience of his blessed will. [74] And so, as
   we confess that God the Father created us when we were not; [75] as his
   Son, our Lord Jesus redeemed us when we were enemies to him; [76] so
   also do we confess that the Holy Ghost does sanctify and regenerate us,
   without all respect of any merit proceeding from us, be it before or be
   it after our regeneration. [77] To speak this one thing yet in more
   plain words: as we willingly spoil ourselves of all honour and glory of
   our own creation and redemption, [78] so do we also of our regeneration
   and sanctification; for of ourselves we are not sufficient to think one
   good thought; but he who has begun the good work in us, is only he that
   continues us in the same, [79] to the praise and glory of his
   undeserved grace. [80]

Chapter 13. The Cause of Good Works

   So that the cause of good works we confess to be, not our free will,
   but the Spirit of the Lord Jesus who, dwelling in our hearts by true
   faith, brings forth such good works as God has prepared for us to walk
   into. For this we most boldly affirm, that blasphemy it is to say that
   Christ Jesus abides in the hearts of such as in whom there is no spirit
   of sanctification. [81] And therefore we fear not to affirm that
   murderers, oppressors, cruel persecutors, adulterers, whoremongers,
   filthy persons, idolaters, drunkards, thieves, and all workers of
   iniquity, have neither true faith, neither any portion of the spirit of
   sanctification, which proceeds from the Lord Jesus, so long as
   obstinately they continue in their wickedness.

   For how soon that ever the Spirit of the Lord Jesus (which God's elect
   children receive by true faith) takes possession in the heart of any
   man, so soon does he regenerate and renew the same man; so that he
   begins to hate that which before he loved, and begins to love that
   which before he hated. And from thence comes that continual battle
   which is betwixt the flesh and the spirit in God's children; while the
   flesh and natural man (according to their own corruption) lust for
   things pleasing and delectable unto the self, grudge in adversity, are
   lifted up in prosperity, and at every moment are prone and ready to
   offend the Majesty of God. [82] But the Spirit of God, which gives
   witnessing to our spirit, that we are the sons of God, [83] makes us to
   resist filthy pleasures, and to groan in God's presence for deliverance
   from this bondage of corruption; [84] and finally, to triumph over sin
   that it reign not in our mortal bodies. [85]

   This battle have not the carnal men, being destitute of God's Spirit;
   but [they] do follow and obey sin with greediness, and without
   repentance, even as the devil and their corrupt lusts do prick them.
   But the sons of God (as before is said) do fight against sin, do sob
   and mourn, when they perceive themselves tempted to iniquity; and if
   they fall, they rise again with earnest and unfeigned repentance. [86]
   And these things they do not by their own power, but the power of the
   Lord Jesus, without whom they were able to do nothing. [87]

Chapter 14. What Works are Reputed Good before God

   We confess and acknowledge that God has given to man his holy law, in
   which not only are forbidden all such works as displease and offend his
   godly Majesty, but also are commanded all such as please him, and as he
   has promised to reward. [88] And these works are of two sorts: the one
   are done to the honour of God, the other to the profit of our
   neighbours; and both have the revealed will of God for their assurance.

   To have one God; to worship and honour him; to call upon him in all our
   troubles; to reverence his holy name; to hear his word; to believe the
   same; to communicate with his holy sacraments, are the works of the
   first table. [89] To honour father, mother, princes, rulers, and
   superior powers; to love them, to support them, yea, to obey their
   charges (not repugning to the commandment of God); to save the lives of
   innocents; to repress tyranny; to defend the oppressed; to keep our
   bodies clean and holy; to live in sobriety and temperance; to deal
   justly with all men, both in word and in deed; and, finally, to repress
   all appetite of our neighbour's hurt, [90] are the good works of the
   second table, which are most pleasing and acceptable unto God, as those
   works that are commanded by himself.

   The contrary whereof is sin most odious, which always displeases him,
   and provokes him to anger: as, not to call upon him alone, when we have
   need; not to hear his word with reverence; to contemn and despise it;
   to have or to worship idols; to maintain and defend idolatry; lightly
   to esteem the reverent name of God; to profane, abuse, or contemn the
   sacraments of Christ Jesus; to disobey or resist any that God has
   placed in authority (while they pass not over the bounds of their
   office); [91] to murder, or to consent thereto; to bear hatred, or to
   suffer innocent blood to be shed if we may gainstand it; [92] and,
   finally, the transgressing of any other commandment in the first or
   second table, we confess and affirm to be sin, [93] by the which God's
   anger and displeasure are kindled against the proud and unthankful
   world. So that good works we affirm to be these only that are done in
   faith, [94] at God's commandment, [95] who in his law has expressed
   what be the things that please him. And evil works, we affirm not only
   those that expressedly are done against God's commandment, [96] but
   those also that, in matters of religion and worshipping of God, have no
   other assurance but the invention and opinion of man: which God from
   the beginning has ever rejected, as by the prophet Isaiah, [97] and by
   our master Christ Jesus, we are taught in these words: In vain do they
   worship me, teaching the doctrines and precepts of men. [98]

Chapter 15. The Perfection of the Law and Imperfection of Man

   The law of God we confess and acknowledge most just, most equal, most
   holy, and most perfect: commanding those things which, being wrought in
   perfection, were able to give life, and able to bring man to eternal
   felicity. [99] But our nature is so corrupt, so weak, and so imperfect,
   that we are never able to fulfill the works of the law in perfection.
   [100] Yea, If we say we have no sin (even after we are regenerate), we
   deceive ourselves, and the verity of God is not into us. [101] And
   therefore it behoved us to apprehend Christ Jesus, with his justice and
   satisfaction, who is the end and accomplishment of the law, by whom we
   are set at this liberty, that the curse and malediction of the law fall
   not upon us, albeit we fulfill not the same in all points. [102] For
   God the Father, beholding us in the body of his Son Christ Jesus,
   accepts our imperfect obedience, as it were perfect, [103] and covers
   our works, which are defiled with many spots, [104] with the justice of
   his Son.

   We do not mean that we are set so at liberty, that we owe no obedience
   to the law (for that before we have plainly confessed). But this we
   affirm, that no man in earth (Christ Jesus only excepted) has given,
   gives, or shall give in work, that obedience to the law which the law
   requires. But when we have done all things, we must fall down and
   unfeignedly confess, that we are unprofitable servants. [105] And
   therefore whosoever boast themselves of the merits of their own works,
   or put their trust in the works of supererogation, boast themselves of
   that which is not, and put their trust in damnable idolatry.

Chapter 16. Of the Kirk

   As we believe in one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; so do we most
   constantly believe that from the beginning there has been, now is, and
   to the end of the world shall be, a kirk: that is to say, a company and
   multitude of men chosen of God, who rightly worship and embrace him, by
   true faith in Christ Jesus, [106] who is the only Head of the same
   kirk, which also is the body and spouse of Christ Jesus; which kirk is
   Catholic  that is, universal  because it contains the elect of all
   ages, all realms, nations, and tongues, be they of the Jews, or be they
   of the Gentiles; who have communion and society with God the Father,
   and with his Son Christ Jesus, through the sanctification of his Holy
   Spirit; [107] and therefore it is called the communion, not of profane
   persons, but of saints, who, as citizens of the heavenly Jerusalem,
   [108] have the fruition of the most inestimable benefits: to wit, of
   one God, one Lord Jesus, one faith, and of one baptism; [109] out of
   the which kirk there is neither life, nor eternal felicity. And
   therefore we utterly abhor the blasphemy of them that affirm that men
   which live according to equity and justice shall be saved, what
   religion that ever they have professed. For as without Christ Jesus
   there is neither life nor salvation, [110] so shall there none be
   participant thereof, but such as the Father has given unto his Son
   Christ Jesus, and those [that] in time come unto him, [111] avow his
   doctrine, and believe into him (we comprehend the children with the
   faithful parents). [112] This kirk is invisible, known only to God, who
   alone knows whom he has chosen, [113] and comprehends as well (as said
   is) the elect that are departed (commonly called the kirk triumphant),
   as those that yet live and fight against sin and Satan as shall live
   hereafter. [114]

Chapter 17. The Immortality of the Souls

   The elect departed are in peace and rest from their labours: [115] not
   that they sleep and come to a certain oblivion (as some fantastics do
   affirm), but that they are delivered from all fear, all torment, and
   all temptation, to which we and all God's elect are subject in this
   life, [116] and therefore do bear the name of the kirk militant: as
   contrariwise, the reprobate and unfaithful departed, have anguish,
   torment, and pain, that cannot be expressed. [117] So that neither are
   the one nor the other in such sleep that they feel not joy or torment,
   as the parable of Christ Jesus in the sixteenth [chapter] of Luke,
   [118] his words to the thief, [119] and these words of the souls crying
   under the altar, [120] O Lord, thou that art righteous and just, how
   long shalt thou not revenge our blood upon them that dwell upon the
   earth! doth plainly testify.

Chapter 18. Of the Notes by Which the True Kirk
is Discerned from the False
and Who Shall be Judge of the Doctrine

   Because that Satan from the beginning has laboured to deck his
   pestilent synagogue with the title of the kirk of God, and has inflamed
   the hearts of cruel murderers to persecute, trouble, and molest the
   true kirk and members thereof  as Cain did Abel; [121] Ishmael, Isaac;
   [122] Esau, Jacob; [123] and the whole priesthood of the Jews, Christ
   Jesus himself, and his apostles after him; [124] it is a thing most
   requisite that the true kirk be discerned from the filthy synagogue, by
   clear and perfect notes, lest we, being deceived, receive and embrace
   to our own condemnation the one for the other. The notes, signs, and
   assured tokens whereby the immaculate spouse of Christ Jesus is known
   from that horrible harlot, the kirk malignant; we affirm are neither
   antiquity, title usurped, lineal descent, place appointed, nor
   multitude of men approving an error  for Cain in age and title was
   preferred to Abel and Seth; [125] Jerusalem had prerogative above all
   places of the earth, [126] where also were the priests lineally
   descended from Aaron; and greater multitude followed the scribes,
   Pharisees, and priests, than unfeignedly believed and approved Christ
   Jesus and his doctrine; [127] and yet, as we suppose, no man (of whole
   judgment) will grant that any of the forenamed were the kirk of God.

   The notes, therefore, of the true kirk of God we believe, confess, and
   avow to be: first, the true preaching of the word of God, into the
   which God has revealed himself to us, as the writings of the prophets
   and apostles do declare; secondly, the right administration of the
   sacraments of Christ Jesus, which must be annexed unto the word and
   promise of God, to seal and confirm the same in our hearts; [128] last,
   ecclesiastical discipline uprightly ministered, as God's word
   prescribes, whereby vice is repressed, and virtue nourished. [129]
   Wheresoever then these former notes are seen, and of any time continue
   (be the number [of persons] never so few, about two or three) there,
   without all doubt, is the true kirk of Christ: who, according to his
   promise is in the midst of them: [130] not that universal [kirk] (of
   which we have before spoken) but particular; such as were in Corinth,
   [131] Galatia, [132] Ephesus, [133] and other places in which the
   ministry was planted by Paul, and were of himself named the kirks of
   God.

   And such kirks we, the inhabitants of the realm of Scotland, professors
   of Christ Jesus, confess ourselves to have in our cities, towns, and
   places reformed; for the doctrine taught in our kirks is contained in
   the written word of God: to wit, in the books of the New and Old
   Testaments: in those books, we mean, which of the ancient have been
   reputed canonical, in the which we affirm that all things necessary to
   be believed for the salvation of mankind are sufficiently expressed.
   [134] The interpretation whereof, we confess, neither appertains to
   private nor public person, neither yet to any kirk for any preeminence
   or prerogative, personal or local, which one has above another; but
   appertains to the Spirit of God, by the which also the scripture was
   written. [135]

   When controversy then happens, for the right understanding of any place
   or sentence of scripture, or for the reformation of any abuse within
   the kirk of God, we ought not so much to look what men before us have
   said or done, as unto that which the Holy Ghost uniformly speaks within
   the body of the scriptures, and unto that which Christ Jesus himself
   did, and commanded to be done. [136] For this is a thing universally
   granted, that the Spirit of God (which is the Spirit of unity) is in
   nothing contrary unto himself. [137] If then the interpretation,
   determination, or sentence of any doctor, kirk, or council, repugn to
   the plain word of God written in any other place of scripture, it is a
   thing most certain, that there is not the true understanding and
   meaning of the Holy Ghost, supposing that councils, realms, and nations
   have approved and received the same. For we dare not receive and admit
   any interpretation which directly repugns to any principal point of our
   faith, or to any other plain text of scripture, or yet unto the rule of
   charity.

Chapter 19. The Authority of the Scriptures

   As we believe and confess the scriptures of God sufficient to instruct
   and make the man of God perfect, so do we affirm and avow the authority
   of the same to be of God, and neither to depend on men nor angels.
   [138] We affirm, therefore, that such as allege the scripture to have
   no authority, but that which is received from the kirk, to be
   blasphemous against God, and injurious to the true kirk, which always
   hears and obeys the voice of her own Spouse and Pastor, but takes not
   upon her to be mistress over the same. [139]

Chapter 20. Of General Councils, of Their Power, Authority,
and Causes of Their Convention

   As we do not rashly damn that which godly men, assembled together in
   general councils, lawfully gathered, have proponed unto us; so without
   just examination dare we not receive whatsoever is obtruded unto men
   under the name of general councils. For plain it is, as they were men,
   so have some of them manifestly erred, and that in matters of great
   weight and importance. [140] So far then as the council proves the
   determination and commandment that it gives by the plain word of God,
   so far do we reverence and embrace the same. But if men, under the name
   of a council, pretend to forge unto us new articles of our faith, or to
   make constitutions repugning to the word of God, then utterly we must
   refuse the same as the doctrine of devils, which draws our souls from
   the voice of our only God to follow the doctrines and constitutions of
   men. [141]

   The cause, then, why general councils convened, was neither to make any
   perpetual law (which God before had not made), nor yet to forge new
   articles of our belief, neither to give the word of God authority  much
   less to make that to be his word, or yet the true interpretation of the
   same, which was not before by his holy will expressed in his word.
   [142] But the cause of councils (we mean of such as merit the name of
   councils), was partly for confutation of heresies, and for giving
   public confession of their faith to the posterity following: which both
   they did by the authority of God's written word, and not by any opinion
   or prerogative that they could not err, by reason of their general
   assembly. And this we judge to have been the chief cause of general
   councils. The other was for good policy and order to be constituted and
   observed in the kirk, in which (as in the house of God) [143] it
   becomes all things to be done decently and into order. [144] Not that
   we think that any policy, and one order in ceremonies can be appointed
   for all ages, times, and places: for as ceremonies (such as men have
   devised) are but temporal, so may and ought they to be changed, when
   they rather foster superstition than that they edify the kirk using the
   same.

Chapter 21. Of the Sacraments

   As the fathers under the law (besides the verity of the sacrifices) had
   two chief sacraments  to wit, circumcision and the Passover, the
   despisers and contemners whereof were not reputed for God's people
   [145]  so do we acknowledge and confess that we now, in the time of the
   evangel, have two sacraments only, instituted by the Lord Jesus, and
   commanded to be used of all those that will be reputed members of his
   body: to wit, baptism and the supper, or table of the Lord Jesus,
   called the communion of his body and blood. [146] And these sacraments
   (as well of the Old as of the New Testament) were instituted of God,
   not only to make a visible difference betwixt his people, and those
   that were without his league; but also to exercise the faith of his
   children and, by participation of the same sacraments, to seal in their
   hearts the assurance of his promise, and of that most blessed
   conjunction, union, and society, which the elect have with their head,
   Christ Jesus.

   And thus we utterly damn the vanity of those that affirm sacraments to
   be nothing else but naked and bare signs. No, we assuredly believe that
   by baptism we are engrafted in Christ Jesus, to be made partakers of
   his justice, by the which our sins are covered and remitted; and also,
   that in the supper, rightly used, Christ Jesus is so joined with us,
   that he becomes the very nourishment and food of our souls. [147] Not
   that we imagine any transubstantiation of bread into Christ's natural
   body, and of wine in his natural blood (as the Papists have
   perniciously taught and damnably believed); but this union and
   conjunction which we have with the body and blood of Christ Jesus, in
   the right use of the sacraments, is wrought by operation of the Holy
   Ghost, who by true faith carries us above all things that are visible,
   carnal, and earthly, and makes us to feed upon the body and blood of
   Christ Jesus, which was once broken and shed for us, which now is in
   heaven, and appears in the presence of his Father for us. [148] And
   yet, notwithstanding the far distance of place which is betwixt his
   body now glorified in the heaven, and us now mortal in this earth, yet
   we most assuredly believe that the bread that we break is the communion
   of Christ's body, and the cup which we bless is the communion of his
   blood. [149] So that we confess, and undoubtedly believe, that the
   faithful, in the right use of the Lord's table, do so eat the body and
   drink the blood of the Lord Jesus, that he remains in them and they in
   him: yea, that they are so made flesh of his flesh, and bone of his
   bones, [150] that as the Eternal Godhead has given to the flesh of
   Christ Jesus (which of its own condition and nature was mortal and
   corruptible) [151] life and immortality, so does Christ Jesus' flesh
   and blood eaten and drunken by us, give to us the same prerogatives.
   Which, albeit we confess are neither given unto us at that only time,
   neither yet by the proper power and virtue of the sacrament only; yet
   we affirm that the faithful, in the right use of the Lord's table, have
   such conjunction with Christ Jesus, [152] as the natural man cannot
   apprehend.

   Yea, and further we affirm, that albeit the faithful, oppressed by
   negligence, and manly infirmity, do not profit so much as they would in
   the very instant action of the supper, yet shall it after bring fruit
   forth, as lively seed sown in good ground. For the Holy Spirit (which
   can never be divided from the right institution of the Lord Jesus) will
   not frustrate the faithful of the fruit of that mystical action; but
   all this, we say, comes by true faith, which apprehends Christ Jesus,
   who only makes this sacrament effectual unto us. And, therefore,
   whosoever slanders us, as that we affirm or believe sacraments to be
   only naked and bare signs, do injury unto us, and speak against the
   manifest truth.

   But this liberally and frankly we must confess, that we make a
   distinction betwixt Christ Jesus, in his natural substance, and betwixt
   the elements in the sacramental signs; so that we will neither worship
   the signs in place of that which is signified by them; neither yet do
   we despise and interpret them as unprofitable and vain; but do use them
   with all reverence, examining ourselves diligently before that so we
   do, because we are assured by the mouth of the apostle, That such as
   eat of that bread, and drink of that cup, unworthily, are guilty of the
   body and of the blood of the Lord Jesus. [153]

Chapter 22. Of the Right Administration Of the Sacraments

   That sacraments be rightly ministered, we judge two things requisite:
   the one, that they be ministered by lawful ministers, whom we affirm to
   be only they that are appointed to the preaching of the word, or into
   whose mouths God has put some sermon of exhortation, they being men
   lawfully chosen thereto by some kirk. The other, that they be
   ministered in such elements, and in such sort, as God has appointed;
   else, we affirm that they cease to be right sacraments of Christ Jesus.

   And therefore it is that we flee the society of the Papistical kirk, in
   participation of their sacraments: first, because their ministers are
   no ministers of Christ Jesus; yea (which is more horrible) they suffer
   women, whom the Holy Ghost will not suffer to teach in the
   congregation, to baptize. And, secondly, because they have so
   adulterated both the one sacrament and the other with their own
   inventions, that no part of Christ's action abides in the original
   purity: for oil, salt, spittle, and suchlike in baptism, are but men's
   inventions. Adoration, veneration, bearing through streets and towns,
   and keeping of bread in boxes or buists [chests], are profanation of
   Christ's sacraments, and no use of the same. For Christ Jesus said,
   Take, eat, etc. Do ye this in remembrance of me. [154] By which words
   and charge he sanctified bread and wine, to be the sacrament of his
   body and blood, to the end that the one should be eaten, and that all
   should drink of the other; and not that they should be kept to be
   worshipped, and honoured as God, as the blind Papists have done
   heretofore, who also committed sacrilege, stealing from the people the
   one part of the sacrament: to wit, the blessed cup.

   Moreover, that the sacraments be rightly used, it is required that the
   end and cause why the sacraments were instituted be understood and
   observed, as well of the minister, as the receivers. For if the opinion
   be changed in the receiver, the right use ceases: which is most evident
   by the rejection of the sacrifices; as also if the teacher plainly
   teaches false doctrine, which were odious and abominable before God
   (albeit they were his own ordinances), because that wicked men use them
   to another end than God has ordained. The same affirm we of the
   sacraments in the Papistical kirk, in which we affirm the whole action
   of the Lord Jesus to be adulterated, as well in the external form, as
   in the end and opinion. What Christ Jesus did, and commanded to be
   done, is evident by the evangelists, and by Saint Paul. What the priest
   does at his altar we need not rehearse. The end and cause of Christ's
   institution, and why the selfsame should be used, is expressed in these
   words: Do this in remembrance of me. As oft as ye shall eat of this
   bread and drink of this cup, ye shall show forth, that is, extol,
   preach, magnify, and praise, the Lord's death till he come. [155] But
   to what end, and in what opinion, the priests say their Mass, let the
   words of the same, their own doctors and writings witness: to wit, that
   they, as mediators betwixt Christ and his kirk, do offer unto God the
   Father a sacrifice propitiatory for the sins of the quick and the dead.
   Which doctrine, as blasphemous to Christ Jesus, and making derogation
   to the sufficiency of his only sacrifice, once offered for purgation of
   all those that shall be sanctified, [156] we utterly abhor, detest, and
   renounce.

Chapter 23. To Whom the Sacraments Appertain

   We confess and acknowledge that baptism appertains as well to the
   infants of the faithful, as unto those that be of age and discretion.
   And so we damn the error of the Anabaptists, who deny baptism to
   appertain to children before that they have faith and understanding.
   [157] But the supper of the Lord we confess to appertain to such only
   as be of the household of faith, and can try and examine themselves, as
   well in their faith, as in their duty towards their neighbors. Such as
   eat and drink at that holy table without faith, or being at dissension
   and division with their brethren, do eat unworthily: [158] and
   therefore it is, that in our kirks our ministers take public and
   particular examination of the knowledge and conversation of such as are
   to be admitted to the table of the Lord Jesus.

Chapter 24. Of the Civil Magistrate

   We confess and acknowledge empires, kingdoms, dominions, and cities to
   be distinguished and ordained by God: the powers and authorities in the
   same (be it of emperors in their empires, of kings in their realms,
   dukes and princes in their dominions, or of other magistrates in free
   cities) to be God's holy ordinance, ordained for manifestation of his
   own glory, and for the singular profit and commodity of mankind. [159]
   So that whosoever goes about to take away or to confound the whole
   state of civil policies, now long established; we affirm the same men
   not only to be enemies to mankind, but also wickedly to fight against
   God's expressed will. [160]

   We further confess and acknowledge, that such persons as are placed in
   authority are to be loved, honoured, feared, and held in most reverent
   estimation [161] because they are the lieutenants of God, in whose
   sessions God himself does sit and judge [162] (yea even the judges and
   princes themselves), to whom by God is given the sword, to the praise
   and defense of good men, and to revenge and punish all open
   malefactors. [163] Moreover, to kings, princes, rulers, and
   magistrates, we affirm that chiefly and most principally the
   conservation and purgation of the religion appertains; so that not only
   they are appointed for civil policy, but also for maintenance of the
   true religion, and for suppressing of idolatry and superstition
   whatsoever: as in David, [164] Jehoshaphat, [165] Hezekiah, [166]
   Josiah, [167] and others, highly commended for their zeal in that case,
   may be espied.

   And therefore we confess and avow, that such as resist the supreme
   power (doing that thing which appertains to his charge), do resist
   God's ordinance, and therefore cannot be guiltless. And further, we
   affirm that whosoever denies unto them their aid, counsel and comfort,
   while the princes and rulers vigilantly travail in the execution of
   their office, that the same men deny their help, support and counsel to
   God, who, by the presence of his lieutenant, craves it of them.

Chapter 25. The Gifts Freely Given to the Kirk

   Albeit that the word of God truly preached, and the sacraments rightly
   ministered, and discipline executed according to the word of God, be
   the certain and infallible signs of the true kirk; yet do we not so
   mean that every particular person joined with such a company be an
   elect member of Christ Jesus. [168] For we acknowledge and confess,
   that darnel, cockle, and chaff may be sown, grow, and in great
   abundance lie in the midst of the wheat: that is, the reprobate may be
   joined in the society of the elect, and may externally use with them
   the benefits of the word and sacraments; but such being but temporal
   professors in mouth, but not in heart, do fall back and continue not to
   the end; [169] and therefore have they no fruit of Christ's death,
   resurrection, nor ascension.

   But such as with heart unfeignedly believe, and with mouth boldly
   confess the Lord Jesus (as before we have said) shall most assuredly
   receive these gifts: [170] first, in this life, remission of sins, and
   that by only faith in Christ's blood, insomuch that, albeit sin remains
   and continually abides in these our mortal bodies, yet is it not
   imputed unto us, but is remitted and covered with Christ's justice.
   [171] Secondly, in the general judgment there shall be given to every
   man and woman resurrection of the flesh; [172] for the sea shall give
   her dead, the earth those that therein be enclosed; yea, the Eternal,
   our God, shall stretch out his hand upon the dust, and the dead shall
   arise incorruptible, [173] and that in the substance of the selfsame
   flesh that every man now bears, [174] to receive according to their
   works, glory or punishment. [175] For such as now delight in vanity,
   cruelty, filthiness, superstition, or idolatry, shall be adjudged to
   the fire unquenchable, in which they shall be tormented for ever, as
   well in their own bodies, as in their souls, which now they give to
   serve the devil in all abomination. But such as continue in well doing
   to the end, boldly professing the Lord Jesus, we constantly believe
   that they shall receive glory, honour, and immortality, to reign for
   ever in life everlasting with Christ Jesus, [176] to whose glorified
   body all his elect shall be made like, [177] when he shall appear again
   to judgment, and shall render up the kingdom to God his Father, who
   then shall be, and ever shall remain all in all things, God blessed for
   ever: [178] to whom, with the Son, and with the Holy Ghost, be all
   honour and glory, now and ever. Amen.

   Arise, O Lord, and let thy enemies be confounded: Let them flee from
   thy presence that hate thy godly name: Give thy servants strength to
   speak thy word in boldness; and let all nations cleave to thy true
   knowledge. [179]

   So be it.
