SERMON I. [1]

   1 John iv. 20.

   If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
   liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath
   seen; how can he love God whom
   he hath not seen.

   MY purpose at present is not to speak from these words either of love
   to God, or our brother, absolutely and singly: but comparatively only,
   according to that connexion which they have one with another; and the
   difference of the one from the other respecting their objects, as the
   object of the one is somewhat visible, and of the other somewhat
   invisible. There is one thing necessary to be premised to this intended
   discourse concerning the acceptation of love here, and it is this; that
   the apostle in this little tractate of love, as this epistle may for
   the most part be called, doth not design to treat of love as a
   philosopher, that is, to give us a precise formal notion of it; but to
   speak of it with a latitude of sense; not so indeed as to exclude the
   formal notion of love as it is seated in the inner man, but so as to
   comprehend in it such apt expressions and actings of it, as according
   to the common sense of men were most agreeable and natural to it. And
   therefore speaking of love to God in 2 chapter, ver. 5. he tells us,
   that "Whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
   perfected:" that is, the very perfection of the love of God stands in
   this, in keeping his word. So in chapter 5, ver. 3. "This (saith he) is
   the love of God, that we keep his commandments." And speaking of the
   other branch of this love in chapter iii. ver. 17. he saith, "Whoso
   hath this world's goods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth
   up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in
   him?" The apostle calls this the love of God also; it being one and the
   same divine principle of love implanted by God himself, which spreads
   itself to several objects all under one and the same communication, as
   having more or less of the divine beauty and loveliness appearing in
   them.

   So that if any one should go about here to play the sophister, and say,
   "Love is a thing, which hath its whole nature, and residence in the
   inner man. Define it never so accurately, you will find it to be
   wholly, and entirely seated there. Now therefore, since nothing can be
   denied of itself, let it be confined and shut up there never so
   closely, admit that no expression be made of it one way or another, yet
   I need not be solicitous on this account: for let me walk and do as I
   list, the love of God may be in me for all that; since love is such a
   thing, wherever it is, as must have its whole nature within one." To
   this the apostle would reply, No, I do not speak of love in so strict a
   sense. Love, as I intend it, is not to be taken so: or if it were, it
   must however be supposed to have that strength and vigour with it, as
   to enable it to be the governing principle of a man's life; to affect
   and influence his own soul; and so to run through the whole course of
   his daily practice. I speak of love according to what it virtually
   comprehends in it; namely, conformity to the will of God, and obedience
   to his laws whereby that will is made known. And thus love is elsewhere
   taken in Scripture also. Our Saviour you know gathers up our duty into
   love. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with
   all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself; upon
   these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Matt. xxii.
   37, 40.The apostle also tells us, that "love is the fulfilling of the
   law." Rom. xiii. 10. Therefore love to God and our brother, in this
   place, must be taken for the summary or abridgement of our whole duty;
   an epitome of the two tables; a virtual comprehension of all we owe
   either to God or man, that is, universal holiness, and an entire
   obedience to the divine will. But still in this system or collection of
   duties, love, strictly and formally taken, is to be considered as the
   primary and principal thing; as seated and enthroned in the heart and
   soul; and as the original principle, upon which all other duties do
   depend, and from whence they must proceed. The acceptation of love
   being thus settled, there are three things that I chiefly intend to
   shew from this scripture.

   FIRST. That there is a greater difficulty of living in the exercise of
   love to God than towards man, upon this account, that he is nor the
   object of sight, as man is; and consequently, that the duties of the
   second table are, according to this our present state of dependence on
   external sense, more easy and familiar to us than the duties of the
   first. Hence proceeds that general propensity, which it greatly
   concerns us to be aware of; to acquiesce and take up our rest in a
   fair, civil deportment among men, without ever being concerned to have
   our souls possessed with holy, lively, and powerful affections towards
   God.

   SECONDLY. I shall shew, that this impossibility of seeing God, doth not
   however excuse us from exercising love to him in this our present
   state. It is indeed one reason why he is actually so little loved in
   the world, but it is no sufficient excuse. For the impossibility of
   seeing God doth not render it impossible to love him, and to live in
   his love, while we are here in this world, dwelling in the flesh. And
   this also is plainly grounded in the text; for this vehement
   expostulation of the apostle, "If any man do not love his brother whom
   he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?" plainly
   supposes it to be an intolerable thing not to love God. And therefore
   hence he takes the advantage of enforcing the duty of loving our
   brother, because otherwise we should be convicted, and proved to be no
   lovers of God; taking it for granted, that this would be esteemed a
   most horrid thing, even at the very first sight. Otherwise his
   exhortation would have no force, nor pungency in it; but would be flat,
   and insignificant. Therefore he plainly supposes here, that though
   God's not being the object of sight doth render the exercise of love to
   him, upon that account, more difficult; yet it doth not render it
   impossible, or the neglect of it at all excusable; but considers it as
   a thing to which men are most indispensably obliged. This therefore
   will be my second head to discourse upon from this scripture. And then
   in the

   THIRD place, my design is to shew you the absurdity of their profession
   of love to God, who do not love their brother also; and how false and
   fulsome a thing it is for men to pretend to any thing of sanctity and
   religion, while they neglect the du ties of the second table. Of these
   we shall speak in order, and begin now with the

   FIRST observation, that the impossibility of seeing God renders the
   exercise of our love to him more difficult, than the exercise of it
   towards man whom we do see. In this doctrine there are two branches,
   which are to be distinctly considered.

   I. That it is more difficult to love God than our brother.

   II. That one great reason of it is, that we cannot see God, as we do
   our brother.

   I. As to the former of these, that there is a greater difficulty in the
   exercise of love to God than to men, we may collect from the common
   observation of the world. For it is very plain and evident, that the
   common course and practice of men shews what is more easy to them, and
   what less; it plainly discovers which way they are most inclined. This
   is the thing, which I understand here by difficulty; and it answers the
   intent and force of the apostle's expression, "How can he that loveth
   not his brother whom he hath seen, love God whom he hath not seen?"
   This plainly must be understood in a relative sense, and have respect
   to some agent, and here must have reference to ourselves. It is less
   easy to us, that is, it is a thing which our nature in our present
   state doth less incline us to, actually to live in the exercise of love
   towards God, than towards men. And, I say, what men are more or less
   inclined to, is to be seen in their common course; and from the common
   observation of the state and posture of the world we may gather, that
   men in general are less inclined to love God, than one another. And
   though it be very true, there is too little of love, kindness, and
   mutual affection among men, and a great neglect of justice, common
   honesty, and the other duties of the second table, which love must be
   understood to comprehend; yet certainly the instances are not so rare
   of persons that are kind, courteous, affectionate, and well-humoured
   one to another, as of persons well-affected towards God. This is a
   thing which commands our assent even at the very first sight. Nay
   further, though it is also no less true, that men are too much lovers
   of themselves, to the exclusion not only of God, but of men too; yet
   certainly there is more of love to men, than to God, prevailing in the
   world. And to make this out let us go to the usual evidences and
   expressions of love; such as mindfulness of others, trust in them, a
   readiness to be concerned for their interest, a studious care to please
   them, loving to converse with them, or seeking and being pleased with
   it, and the like. If we descend, I say, to the consideration of such
   evidences of love as these are, we shall find that man is generally
   better beloved, than God is. And that this may gain the greater
   possession of our souls, let us a little consider these particular
   evidences of love; and then see whether men are not generally more
   beloved by one another, than God is by them; hereby we shall plainly
   see, what is most agreeable to their temper, and what not. And,

   1. Mindfulness, or a kind remembrance of others, is a most natural
   evidence of love. But what! are men who transact affairs one with
   another, so apt to forget each other, as they are to forget God? It is
   given us as a common distinctive character of a wicked man, that he is
   one that hath not God in all his thoughts. For thus saith the Psalmist,
   "The wicked in the pride of his countenance," that is, his heart
   expressing itself in the haughtiness of his countenance, and his
   supercilious looks, "will not seek after God; God is not in all his
   thoughts." Ps. x. 4. And by the same divine penman a wicked man, and a
   forgetter of God, are used as exegetical expressions. Ps. ix. 17 But
   there is many a wicked man that will kindly remember his friends, his
   relations, even his very companions in. wickedness. And if we demand an
   account of ourselves, do we not find it more easy and familiar to us to
   entertain thoughts concerning our friends, and relations, from day to
   day, than we do to think of God? Are we not also more inclined to love
   them than God? What we love we are not apt to forget. "The desire of
   our soul is to thee, and to the remembrance of thy name." Isa. xxvi. 8.
   Our love to thee, which naturally works by desire, will not let us
   forget thee; it is too deeply impressed and rooted in us ever to lose
   the remembrance of the object of our love. This is one thing that
   sheweth, that God is a great deal less loved by men, than they are by
   one another. Again,

   2. To be apt to trust in one another, is a very natural evidence and
   expression of love. Whom we hate, we cannot trust; whom we love
   entirely, we know not how to distrust. One of the characters of love is
   this, "It hopeth all things, it believeth all things:" (1 Cor. xiii. 7)
   it abhors to entertain a jealous surmise of the person, who is the
   object of it. Now let the matter be tried by this also, and how much
   more ready are men to trust to one another, than they are to trust to
   God? What is there so vain, so uncertain, so unstable, which they are
   not more forward to repose their trust in, than in him? Therefore,
   saith the apostle to Timothy, "Charge them that are rich in this world,
   that they be not high-minded; nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the
   living God." 1 Tim. vi. 17. Which charge implies the propensity of
   men's minds, rather to trust in the most fugitive, uncertain, vanishing
   shadows, than in God himself. This is an argument, that he hath but
   little love among men; that he cannot be trusted; and that few will
   give him credit. But how safely and quietly do men repose a trust and
   confidence in one another? And indeed if faith and trust were not
   natural to men, there would be no such thing as commerce, which is the
   bond of human society. The world must dissolve and break up; all must
   live apart in dens, and caves, and wildernesses, and have nothing to do
   one with another, if they could not trust one another. Without mutual
   confidence, there would be an end of all traffic. But to this, human
   society shews there is a disposition; and you can easily find out
   persons, in whom you would as safely repose your trust and confidence,
   as in your own hearts. You can say, "I would put my life in such a
   man's hands, or what ever is most dear to me." And if that person
   should but promise to undertake an affair, saying, "I will do such a
   thing for you, trust me with it, leave it upon me;" you would be as
   quiet, as if you saw the business done and already effected. But how
   unapt are the hearts of men to trust in God! and this it is, that holds
   off the world from him. He hath sent the gospel of peace and
   reconciliation to mankind, and therein declares the good tidings, how
   willing he is that the controversies should be taken up between men and
   himself; yet none will believe it, none think him in earnest, till he
   is pleased himself to draw them. "Who hath believed," saith the
   prophet, "our report? or, to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?"
   Isaiah liii. 1. Plainly intimating, that the arm of God must go forth
   to make a man believe him, and take his word. A strong argument, that
   he hath but little love among men, when he cannot be trusted; or, at
   least, when so few will give him credit!

   3. A readiness to be concerned for one another's interest and
   reputation, is also a natural evidence of love. And we know how easily
   men are drawn in for one another, and take part with a neighbour, or a
   friend, when they are traduced, and evil spoken of; and especially when
   they see indignities and affronts put upon them. There is usually a
   great siding among persons upon such occasions. "Such a one has spoken
   ill of my friend, I must stand up for him to the uttermost. Another has
   injured him, purloined from him that which was his, and the like; I
   must right him." Should we not reckon him a base fellow, who should
   behold an act of stealing committed upon the estate of another, and not
   make a discovery of it, or endeavour to have him righted? But how
   little generally are men concerned for God, and his affairs! What
   robberies are every where committed against him, and yet how few do lay
   it to heart! How evil is he spoken of many times, and his truth, and
   his ways! But how few can say, "The reproaches wherewith they have
   reproached thee, have fallen upon me?" Ps. lxix. 9. It is true, this is
   the sense of David, when he cries out, "As with a sword in my bones
   mine enemies reproach me, while they say unto me daily, Where is thy
   God?" Ps. xlii. 10. It is to me as if one was forcing a sword into my
   bones, even into my marrow; a most intolerable torment to be upbraided
   in respect to my God: that he is either impotent, and cannot help me;
   or that he is false to me, and answereth not the trust I have reposed
   in him. But how few are there of David's mind, in this case? How many
   oaths and blasphemies can, they hear, wherein the sacred name of God is
   rent and torn, and yet their hearts are not pierced at all! Further,

   4. An earnest study to please men is a natural expression of love. Now
   let the matter be estimated by this, how much less God is loved in the
   world than men. It is an ordinary thing with them to study to please
   one another, to humour one another. "Such and such things I do, and
   such I omit, lest I should displease a relation, a friend, or one that
   I have frequent occasion to converse with." But how few are the
   persons, who can say, "This I do purposely to please my God?" or with
   Joseph, "How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God!" Gen.
   xxxix. 9. A man will oftentime cross his own will, to comply with that
   of another; and reckon it a great piece of civility to recede from his
   own inclination in order to gratify another person, when he can do it
   without any great inconvenience. But how rare a thing is this with
   respect to God! To besuitablee to say, "In such a thing [ displease
   myself, that I may please God; I cross my own will, to comply with
   his." Among men there is especially one sort, that we are more
   concerned and obliged to please, so far as we can; and that is, such as
   rule over us. We are bound to please our superiors; and to obey them,
   that we may do so. And there is no obedience either to God or man, that
   is right in its own kind, but what proceeds from love, and is an
   evidence as well as an effect of it. "If ye love me," saith Christ,
   "keep my commandments." John xiv. 15. "And this is the love of God,"
   saith St. John, "that we keep his word." 1 John v. 3. More over the
   duties of the second table, which we owe to men, particularly that of
   obedience to superiors, are summed up all in love. The apostle having,
   in the 13 chapter of his epistle to the Romans, pressed subjection to
   the higher powers, in that they are of God, adds in the 10th verse,
   that "to love one another is the fulfilling of the law." "Render,"
   saith he, in the same discourse, "to all their dues: tribute, to whom
   tribute is due; custom, to whom custom; fear, to whom fear; honour, to
   whom honour." Rom. xiii. 7, 8. Yet observe, all is wrapt up in love;
   for the command is immediately after, "to owe no man any thing, but to
   love one another:" and in short there is nothing which love doth riot
   comprehend, or to which it doth not incline us.

   But however, though such obedience be due to our human superiors as
   proceedeth from love; yet how apparent is the case, that herein is
   greater love shewn to men, than to God, though too little to both?
   There is indeed too little regard to laws both human and divine, in the
   most important matters; yet surely a great deal less to the latter,
   than to the former. The thing speaks itself as to common observation:
   and we daily see how much more human laws do influence men's practice,
   than those which are divine; and persons that are a great deal more
   prone to be precisely observant of them about matters, which they
   themselves do otherwise count indifferent, than of the laws of God,
   which are about the most necessary matters, and which also are
   acknowledged as such. Thus it hath long apparently been in the
   Christian world. A greater account hath been made of this and that
   arbitrary circumstance, than of the substance of religion itself. More
   stress hath been put upon the cream, the salt, and the oil, and such
   additional of human invention, than on the great obligations of the
   baptismal covenant. And if it were not so, it could never have been
   desired by any, that we should rather be all infidels, than not be
   Christians after their fashion, and in their way. For that it hath been
   evidently so, may be seen in this; that this whole nation itself hath
   at once suffered under the interdict of excommunication in former days.
   All the doors of our churches and chapels have been shut up, only for
   some non-compliance, with this or that human addition; thus they chose
   we should rather be no Christians at all, than not have Christianity
   with those additions. This shews a greater disposition in the minds of
   men to obey human laws, in circumstantial matters; than divine laws, in
   those points which are most necessary and important.

   What then is more apparent, than that God is less loved in the world
   than men are; since persons are more forward to shew respect to them,
   than to him? Not but that we arc bound to shew respect to them too,
   especially to those who represent him, and as his vicegerents rule over
   us. But surely it was never intended, that when we are to obey men for
   God's sake, we should regard him less; we should rather do it so much
   the more on this very account.

   In a word, love ought to be an ingredient in every act of obedience;
   even to human government, as I have said before, as well as to that
   which is divine. What love is expressed in that great canon of our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ! "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to
   you, do ye even so to them;" (Matt. vii. 12.) that is, you ought to
   judge the case thus; "What would I wish to be done to me in such a
   man's circumstances? Would not I expect to be obeyed and reverenced, if
   I were a magistrate? My love to myself would incline me to expect it.
   Therefore my own love to myself, being the measure of that love which I
   owe to another, should oblige me to shew the same respect to him in his
   circumstances, that I would wish to be shewn to me in the like
   circumstances." But here is the iniquity of the case: those whom we
   should honour and love in the Lord for his sake, men are apt to put the
   supreme respect upon; which is to dethrone the supreme Lord of all, and
   to set up his creature in his place. And as to other persons, who are
   not invested with power and authority over us; how many are there of
   those, who will not wrong men, or do them any injustice! How many that
   are most highly civil, and candid in their converse with them, and
   strictly careful not to disoblige them by their behaviour! But who
   sticks at disobliging God, or makes a difficulty of disobeying him?
   Again,

   5. Towards men there is a disposition deeply to regret any offence we
   unwarily have given them. When we, though undesignedly, have done
   another an injury; if, for instance, we but casually tread on his foot,
   or some such like matter, we presently say, "I am afraid I have hurt
   you, I am sorry for it." Common civility would oblige one to express
   such a regret. And if we by any rash word or weak action have
   trespassed upon another, we are reckoned almost unfit for society, if
   we do not shew a sense of our having offended such a person. Men that
   are not very ill-natured indeed, are apt to make apologies, and desire
   to be forgiven in cases where they have offended through inadvertency.
   But how much is it otherwise with men towards God, who trespass upon
   him every day, and never cry to him for mercy! who wear away their
   lives, from one month, year, and day, to another, in continual
   deviations from him, and rebellions against him, without its ever
   coming into their thoughts to say, "Lord forgive me, that I have lived
   so long in the world, as it were, without thee! that I have carried it
   to thee as if I owed thee no duty nor service! Lord, I have offended, I
   desire to put an end to this course, and to do so no more." Finally,

   6. A love of converse or delight in each other's company, is another
   expression of that regard which men have for one another. Man is
   naturally a sociable creature; and how few do you know, or ever have
   known, who do not affect company? Some few instances there are of
   persons, that are of a gloomy retired temper; but generally men seek to
   converse with one another, and take pleasure in it. But alas, how
   little do they care to converse with God! They had rather be any where,
   than in his presence. Many, otherwise ingenious persons, men of good
   dispositions and of facetious tempers, who, as they delight in converse
   themselves, so their conversation proves delightful to others; yet care
   not at what distance they keep themselves from God. How many, I say, of
   such ingenious persons do we know; who yet neglect to pray to God; take
   no pleasure in having any thing to do with him; take his holy name in
   vain; and set themselves at a distance from him, by their own evil
   practices? It may be they will come to the solemnities of public
   worship for the sake of order, and to express their respect to others;
   so that even in those things which are peculiarly appropriated to him,
   they shew more respect to men, than God. And how sociable soever their
   temper is, one with another; yet with the Almighty they care not to
   converse at all, but say to him, "Depart from us, for we desire not the
   knowledge of thy ways." Job xxi. 14. From whence we may conclude, that
   to man in his present state, it is even natural to wish the great God
   out of being. "The fool hath said in his heart there is no God." Ps.
   xiv. 1. "I would there were no God, my vote shall go for it, that there
   were none; I could wish him out of the universe." [2] But you never
   heard of such a monster among men, as to wish there was no man beside
   himself. You never heard of such a hater of mankind, as to wish the
   whole human race into nothing.

   Now all these things concur to evidence or prove to us, that God is
   much less beloved in the world, than men are by one another. And it
   must be allowed that the common practice of men sheweth their
   inclination. This is discovered by constant experience and observation,
   and the very aspect of men's deportment doth represent this as the true
   state of things. And, as I observed before, men may find something of
   it by the experience they have of themselves; even those who have
   applied themselves to the business of religion, seriously and in good
   earnest. They find they can presently set their love on work towards
   this or that creature; but how long an exercise of the thoughts doth it
   require, and how great is the difficulty and toil, before the heart can
   be wrought up into a frame actually loving God!

   So that the former branch of this truth, that men are more inclinable
   to love one another, than they are to love God, is abundantly clear.
   The latter is, that it proceeds in a great measure from this cause,
   that God is not seen by us, as we are by one another; but this must be
   reserved for another discourse.

   [2] For it is in the Hebrew text, 'mr nvl vlvv 'yn 'lhym that is, The
   fool hath said in his heart, no God. And so it may as well be
   understood to signify the fool's wish, as his judgment. And this is the
   more likely to be the meaning; inasmuch as it is manifest, that this is
   not the speech of some particular persons, or of some rare instances of
   most monstrous horrid wickedness; but it is spoken of apostate man in
   general, concerning whom it is said in ver. 3. They are all gone aside,
   they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no

SERMON II. [3]

   IN my Former Discourse I told you, that my design from this scripture
   was not to handle singly and apart either the love of God, or of our
   brother: but to speak of them comparatively, with respect to the
   greater or less facility attending the exercise of the one or the
   other, according to their different objects; the object of the one
   being visible, and of the other, invisible.

   The First Observation raised from the words, after settling the
   acceptation of love, was this: That it is more difficult to live in the
   exercise of love to God, than towards men; because he is not the object
   of sight as we are one to another. In which doctrine, as we observed,
   there are two things to be considered.

   I. That it is more difficult to love God, than our brother. This has
   been proved from experience, and the common observation of the world,
   in several particulars. The,

   II. Branch contained in this proposition, which we are now to speak to
   is this; that one great reason of this difficulty is, that men cannot
   see God, whereas they do see one another. In the prosecuting of this
   part of my subject it will be more necessary to insist on the
   explication, than on the proof of it; and still more upon the
   application than on either of the former. Something I shall endeavour
   to say to all, as the time shall allow.

   1. For the explication of this matter: namely, How we are to
   understand, that the not seeing God as we do men, is a cause of its
   being more difficult to love him than it is to love them, take these
   few propositions, As,

   (1.) That it is not an impossible thing in itself to love the unseen
   God: for if the not seeing him, did make it impossible to love him, he
   could never be loved by any one; because he is seen by none with the
   bodily eye, as we see one another. But it is plainly implied in our
   text, that there are some that love God, notwithstanding his
   invisibility. And the apostle therefore endeavours only to evince the
   absurdity and guilt of not loving our brother, because from thence a
   man may be convicted of being no lover of God, which he accounts as a
   most intolerable thing. The not seeing him therefore doth not make it
   impossible to love God, but only renders it less easy. That is, it is
   not simply impossible, and therefore he who can do all possible things,
   can make the nature of man to love him; he, I say, can form the nature
   of man to the love of himself.

   (2.) The not seeing of God cannot be understood to be a necessary cause
   of this sad thing. It is not such a cause as doth necessitate this
   evil, and horrid effect. For that would be to reflect upon God, as if
   he had made a reasonable and intelligent creature, that was by the
   necessity of his nature prevented from loving him. This would be to
   suppose, that the seeing of God with the bodily eye, were necessary to
   the loving of him; which would make it altogether impossible that he
   should be loved by any of us at all, since he is visible to none. Nay,
   we might say further, he was never to be loved by any being, no not by
   himself, on the same grounds. The cause therefore of this difficulty is
   such as doth not necessitate the thing caused: for that indeed would
   imply that the nature of man is such as would never admit of his loving
   God, and so there would be a contradiction in men's very nature; to
   wit, that they should be capable of being blessed in him only, whom at
   the same time they are not capable of loving. For experience sheweth,
   that there is nothing else in which we can be blessed; nothing below,
   or besides God. Therefore this would infer, that man must be a creature
   made on purpose for misery; for it is evident he can be happy in no
   creature; neither in God could he be happy, if it were simply
   impossible he should ever love him, which is to cast the whole matter
   upon God himself. For if this were the case, then a man might say, "God
   hath given me such a nature as renders it impossible for me even to
   exercise love towards him." But far be it from us that we should
   entertain such a thought of God! that he should make man, a creature
   indued with an intellectual mind, and yet not capable of loving him,
   who is the Author and Original of his life and being! This it were even
   horrid to think of. And again,

   (3.) Nor hath this always been the cause of such an effect; for there
   are some that are actually brought to love God, though they never saw
   him in the sense we speak of, to wit, with the bodily eye. It was not
   so with man from the beginning, that because he could not see God,
   therefore he loved him not, or was for that reason the less inclined to
   love him. He was formed at first for the lore of his Maker, so as to
   take the highest complacency in him, and to make him his supreme
   delight. Man, I say, was made thus upright; but he hath since been
   trying inventions, to see if he could be happy any other way, or upon
   other terms. And therefore since this is not the necessary, nor the
   constant cause of such an effect as this, we must add,

   (4.) That it cannot be a cause of itself alone, but must needs be a
   cause in conjunction with some other cause; by the intervention of some
   other thing, by the concurrence of which this sad effect is brought
   about. For if it be true, that there have been men who have loved God,
   though they never saw him with the bodily eye, there must be some other
   cause of the want of love to God in those persons who love him not,
   besides his invisibility. Because otherwise, since God was always
   invisible, and never seen with the bodily eye, it would necessarily
   follow that he could never have been loved at all. And hence again we
   may observe,

   (5.) That the other cause therefore, which is considerable in this
   case, must needs be the degeneracy of man's nature. It is not to be
   imagined, that man in a state of integrity should be incapable of
   loving God further than he could see him: or that the sight of his eye
   should be the conductor of his affections, and of the motions of his
   soul, which is a reasonable intelligent spirit. But the nature of man
   is not now, what it was. Certainly the case was better with him
   formerly, than it is now in this lapsed state, in which we must confess
   him to be; since there is so great an alteration in his very nature.
   This even the heathens themselves have seen, confessed, and lamented. I
   remember Plato brings in Socrates, somewhere speaking to this sense,
   upon a supposition of the pre-existence of his soul: "There was a time,
   says he, when I could have seen, and did see the first beauty, the
   highest and most perfect comeliness, and loveliness; but now being
   subject to the body, all that impression is vanished and gone." And
   divers ethers have complained of that great darkness and ignorance,
   which was in them; and of the bonds and chains that held their souls
   fast, so that they could not tell how to exercise the powers of them
   towards invisible things. It cannot be then, but the matter must be
   resolved into this; that if our not seeing God is the reason why he is
   so little loved, it is because our nature is grown so corrupt and
   degenerate, that what we see, takes with us most. And again,

   (6.) We may add hereupon, that this degeneracy of the nature of man
   must needs stand very much in the depression of the mind, or
   intellectual powers, and the exaltation of sense. For the mind and. the
   understanding, by the light which God had placed there, were to guide
   and govern the man; instead of which, sense usurped the throne and took
   the government of him into its own hands. During the distraction and
   interruption of that order, which God had originally set between the
   superior and inferior powers of man's soul, sense, I say, usurped the
   throne, and took the government into its own hands, and man has ever
   since basely yielded, and subjected himself to its dominion, so that
   nothing moves him now but what is sensible. In this therefore the
   degeneracy of man very much consists, that sense dictates, and is
   become the governing principle of his life. And,

   (7.) We add further, for of this more will be said when we come to the
   use or application, that the not seeing God can be only a temporary
   cause of our not loving him; inasmuch as it is only a cause, with the
   intervention or concurrence of another cause, I mean, the disturbance
   of that primitive order, which God had settled between one faculty and
   another, belonging to the nature of man. Our not seeing God could never
   have prevented us from loving him, if things had not been so deplorably
   out of course with us, or if this confusion of order had never been
   brought in among us. Therefore this cause is only temporary, that is,
   so long as this great depravation of our nature doth prevail. But there
   are those, with whom it either doth not, or shall not prevail always.
   There are some, blessed be God, in whom this distemper and disorder of
   the soul of man is cured. For God hath sent his Son, the Redeemer, into
   the world on purpose to undertake this cure, and to rectify and set
   things right in men's spirits. And "Christ gave himself for us that he
   might redeem us from all iniquity." [4] and therefore surely from this
   monstrous kind of iniquity, the most horrid of all the rest, to wit,
   that most unrighteous unequal thing, that man should not love his own
   Original, and the Author of his life and being. Therefore it was the
   resolution of the Redeemer, "I will die, but I will remedy this matter.
   I will give myself, I will sacrifice all that I have, but I will bring
   this matter to rights again." I say then it is only a temporary cause,
   which has been assigned of men's not loving God, subsisting only so
   long as man's nature continues depraved: which is not only curable, but
   in part is actually cured, when the work of regeneration is set on
   foot, and the Spirit of the Redeemer has begun to obtain in the soul;
   and it is completely cured, when the new creature becomes mature, and
   is risen up to its full growth and perfection. But in the mean time, so
   long as this distemper in the nature of man continues, our not seeing
   God is one great reason why we love him not. For that way of
   apprehending God, which should be the same with respect to invisible
   objects, that sight is with respect to those which are visible, is
   wanting. And this apprehension will still be wanting, that must supply
   the room of sight, so long as this degeneracy remains in us. While it
   is thus with us, that we are subject to the power of sense which has
   usurped the throne, the soul is destitute of those clear conceptions,
   those lively and vivid apprehensions, that issue in love to God. And so
   the great neglects of God, and the intolerable disrespect and affronts
   that are put upon him in the world, are, in a great measure, according
   to the present degenerate state of man to be resolved into this cause,
   namely, that he is not seen. Hence it is, that so many persons neither
   love, nor regard him at all.

   2. Having thus explained the point we are upon, I now proceed to evince
   this truth, that one great reason, why men are not so apt to love God
   as they are one another, is because he is not the object of sight as we
   are. And this I shall do from the following considerations,
   namely,--that the object is such as would certainly command our love,
   if it could be apprehended aright; and--if it be not so, it must
   proceed from some defect in ourselves.

   (1.) That the object is such as would certainly command our love, if it
   were rightly apprehended. For he is most amiable in himself; and has
   infinitely more obliged man, than they can, ever oblige one another.

   God, I say, is most amiable In himself, who is chiefly to be loved by
   all, though he is not actually so; as he is confessed to be the Supreme
   Object of our understanding, while in reality he is least known. "God
   is light," [5] says the apostle in one place of his epistle; and "God
   is love," [6] as he affirms in two others; a Being of pure light, and
   glorious love. Would he not be loved therefore, if apprehended aright?
   "Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods!" as we find Moses
   speaking with admiration, "Who is like thee, glorious in holiness,
   fearful in praises, doing wonders?" [7] God is a Being wherein the most
   perfect wisdom, goodness, power, truth and righteousness, make so
   admirable a temperature, that it is not possible he should not be
   loved, if he were but known.

   Besides, he has infinitely more obliged men, than they ever have or can
   oblige one another. Take any man whatsoever, whose soul you may suppose
   to be utterly destitute of the love of God, how low and abject soever
   be his state, yet you may say, "Thou impious wretch! thou hast not the
   love of God in thee; though he hath done more for thee, than all the
   men in the world whatever could do, even though they should all join
   together to oblige thee. For is he not the Author of thy life, and
   being? Could the invention of all the men in the world have formed such
   a creature as thou art out of nothing? Is he not a continual Spring of
   life to thee? Thou livest and movest, and hast thy being in him every
   moment. And it is with this design, that God doth continue to thee thy
   breath and being, that thou mightest feel after him, though thou canst
   not see him, and also labour to find him, though he be not far from
   every one of us. Thou art his offspring as even heathen poets tell us:
   [8] no creature could ever have made thee. No man is always doing thee
   good every moment, and at all times; but thou art continually sustained
   by the divine hand. The great God who made thee, feeds thee with breath
   from moment to moment, and is always exercising towards thee sparing
   and sustaining mercy; for his patience and bounty always concur
   together, in every moment's addition to thy breath." It were altogether
   impossible then but that God should be loved, more than all other
   beings, if he were but known. And then,

   (2.) Since an object so excellent in himself, and beneficent towards
   us, must have been loved by us, if there were not some defect in
   ourselves, therefore it plainly appears that there is a defect; and it
   is owing to this, that sense has got dominion over us, and the ruling
   sway within us. For if he be not loved by any one, it must proceed from
   hence, that those lively apprehensions are wanting, which sense is the
   instrument of with reference to visible objects. This is in itself most
   plain, that such an object as the blessed God is, could not but attract
   our love, if there were not some great defect in ourselves, or if sense
   had not the power and dominion over us. And that it has such power and
   dominion, may be seen by comparing these two things together: to wit,
   that generally the objects of sense do make great impressions upon us;
   but the things that fall not within the reach thereof, or exceed its
   sphere, usually make little or none at all.

   [1.] The things of sense, I say, do usually make a great impression
   upon us, and are the things that have the deepest influence and
   operation upon the minds of men, so long as they are destitute of the
   grace of God. Hence it is, that men, who are yet in an unregenerate
   state, are said to be "in the flesh." [9] And a wicked man is spoken of
   as one, that is lost in the flesh; so that there is nothing comes near
   him, nothing affects the soul, nothing reacheth his heart, but what
   some way or other doth slide in upon him, through the mediation of his
   external senses. It is true, sense is the instrument of conveying to us
   the knowledge of many things that are not the objects thereof. But when
   any are spoken of under this character, of being in the flesh, it
   bespeaks the degeneracy of man while unrenewed to be so great, that he
   is a creature so wrapt up in the flesh, as that nothing can come at
   him, but what is sensible. And therefore of such persons it is said,
   "They savour the things of the flesh." [10] While this is the state and
   case of any man, it is no wonder that things, which are not the objects
   of sight, should move his heart but little. It is evident to all that
   make any observations upon themselves, how mighty a power sensible
   things have upon them. A danger that we see, how do we start at it!
   Without using any intervening thoughts, as soon as we sec it we dread
   it. How apt are we also to be amused, by the variety of sensible
   objects! How apt to be ensnared and enticed by them! There fore such as
   have a due care of themselves, what a watch and guard do they set upon
   their sense! For this purpose holy Job is said to "make a covenant with
   his eyes." [11] And we also read of a heathen philosopher, that would
   outdo Job, by putting out his eyes, that he might be able to
   contemplate the better; acting herein agreeable to this Arabian
   proverb, shut the windows, that the house may be light. Thus it is
   evident how great a power sense has over us, to draw us this way and
   that. And,

   [2.] On the other hand, it is also obvious to experience, how little
   power, in general, those things have usually over us which fall not
   under the senses. Not only the objects of our love, but of our other
   affections signify nothing, make no impression if they be invisible.
   Therefore it is spoken of as a characteristical note of the saints,
   that "they look not at the things which are seen, which are but
   temporal, but at the things which are not seen, and are eternal." [12]
   We read particularly of Noah, who "being warned of God of things not
   seen as yet, moved with fear, and through faith prepared an ark for the
   saving of his house." [13] Do but consider; here was one man, and only
   one in a whole world, that was actually moved by the discovery and
   report of things not seen as yet, who when he was warned by God of such
   and such things coming, though unseen at present, admitted into his
   soul a pious preventing fear. I say there seems to have been but one
   such man in a whole world, and he is thereupon recorded with honour in
   the book of God for it. So rare a thing is it that a man should be
   influenced by things not subject to sight, that if there be but one
   Noah, any one such person in the world, Record him for it (saith God)
   to future ages, for his excellency in this, that he took notice of the
   monition, or warning from God, as to things not seen as yet, so as to
   do what was agreeable to the exigence of the case. Accordingly he
   stands at this day as an eminent example to all succeeding ages. And
   you find, that it is the same faith which distinguished! those who
   belong to God, and is the principal rule of their life; to wit, "the
   substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen."
   [14] Plain therefore and visible it is to us, and so it must be to all
   the world, that most persons are governed by their senses; while things
   not sensible never move, nor signify any thing with us. How plainly
   doth experience every day speak in this case! When we tell men of a
   judgment to come, a dreadful tribunal where they must all appear, and
   an endless state of things, that is before them; we are to them as men
   that mock. They cry out, "Surely, you are but in jest; you mean not as
   you say, when you tell us of such dreadful things; we see nothing like
   it, nothing tending that way." Thus in like manner it is said, that
   when the inhabitants of Sodom were admonished by Lot, that fire and
   brimstone were ready to come down upon their heads to punish the most
   flagitious enormities of that people, "he was to them as one that
   mocked." [15] So we are told this will be the language of scoffers in
   the latter days, "Where is the promise of his coming?" [16] As much as
   to say, "You have told us often of the great and terrible day, when the
   sign of the Son of Man shall be seen in the heavens, and that there
   shall be most terrible concomitants of his appearance; but we see
   nothing like it, no token of its approach, "all things continue as they
   were from the beginning of the creation." Thus the judgment of sinners
   is framed only by what is seen; and what is not seen, is not at all
   minded; not regarded by them. So David says, "Because they have no
   changes, therefore they fear not God." [17] They say, "All things are
   as they were. There is no alteration fallen out so important, as seems
   to portend such dreadful things, as you talk of. The sun runs its
   course as it has been wont, and there is the same succession of day and
   night, summer and winter, as in former times. Who therefore can make us
   believe, that there is such a day coming as that, which is so much
   talked of?"

   Now, since we find, that God is such a one as you have heard; namely,
   most amiable in himself, and beneficent towards us, and consequently
   that he would most certainly be beloved, if there were not some great
   defect in us which hinders so blessed an effect; and since we find,
   that there is such a defect, that we have promoted sense to be the
   ruler in us, and that sensible things make a deep impression on us,
   while things that are not subject to the senses have little, or no
   regard from us; we have all the reason in the world to conclude, that
   the great reason why men love not God is, because they do not see him.
   He is out of sight, and they regard him not.

   I THOUGHT to have insisted on many things by way of use, as I proposed,
   after having explained, and evinced, this second branch of my first
   proposition; but i shall now only hint at some things, which I propose
   to speak more largely to in the next discourse.

   IN the first place, we may infer and gather from hence, that the
   apostacy and degeneracy in which this world has been, and is still
   involved, is very dreadful; in that it hath destroyed man's right
   disposition towards God. If it had wrought only so far as to deface
   men's limbs, and turn them into monstrous shapes, it had not been by
   many degrees so tremendous; but it hath deformed the mind, and spoiled
   the temper of the spirit as it hath reference to God most of all, which
   is a thing never enough to be deplored.

   Again secondly, we may further infer, that there is a necessity for
   something or other to supply the room of our not seeing God, as man did
   in the state of innocence; inasmuch as he is not seen by us now in this
   lapsed state, so as to furnish us with such apprehensions of him as to
   engage us to love him. There must be something analogous to sight, some
   communications of God's grace, that must influence our hearts to love
   him; without which it is impossible.

   Moreover thirdly, I would observe, It is a wonderful mercy that God
   hath not wholly concealed himself from men: that though he cannot be
   seen by the bodily eye, yet he hath vouchsafed to shew us, how we may
   attain to the knowledge of him. No man, saith John the Baptist, hath
   seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of
   the Father, he hath declared him. [18] How then ought divine grace to
   be admired for this!

   We may hereupon, fourthly, see the great necessity of much
   gospel-preaching, and that very lively and serious too. There are a
   great many that are apt to say, "What needs such ado? why must we have
   sermons so often?" Surely the exigence of the state of man is but
   little considered by them that say so. Do not we need to be often put
   in mind of the invisible God, when men love him not, because they see
   him not? If they should hear of him neither, what would become of them?
   Certainly they misunderstand the state of things among us, who think
   every little in this kind is too much.

   Finally: We may see how little reason we have to be in love with this
   state of dependence upon sense, which amuseth our souls, usurpeth the
   power over them, and so disturbs and muddles our minds as to divert
   them from their true objects. How little reason have we to be fond of
   living in, and walking after the flesh; which is to live the life of a
   creature, as it were, buried alive. Surely, I say, we have no reason to
   be fond of such a life.

SERMON III. [19]

   HAVING told you in the introduction to the First Discourse, that love
   to God and man, is the summary of our whole duty, I proposed to insist
   on these three things.

   FIRST, that there is a greater difficulty of living in the exercise of
   love towards God than towards men on this account, that he is not the
   object of sight, as man is: or, in other words, men are much more
   disposed to love one another, rather than God, inasmuch as they can see
   each other.

   SECONDLY, that although this is one great reason why men in reality
   love God so little, yet it is no excuse.

   THIRDLY, I proposed also to shew you the manifest falsehood and
   absurdity of any one's pretending to love God, who does not love his
   brother also. The FIRST of these we have made some progress in, and, in
   the handling of it, told you, that it contained these two parts:

   I. That it is more difficult to love God than our brother.

   II. That one great reason of it is, that we cannot see God as we do one
   another.

   As to the former of these, we have shewn you in several particulars,
   that how much soever mutual love is wanting in the world; yet it is not
   so hard a matter to find out instances of kind, goodnatured men, who
   are friendly and fair in their deportment one to another, as it is to
   find persons who are kindly affected towards God. In the prosecution of
   this matter the usual expressions, or evidences of human love were
   considered. Such as mindfulness, or a kind remembrance of one another;
   mutual trust; a readiness to be concerned for each other's interest,
   and reputation; an earnest study to please, and oblige; and a
   disposition deeply to regret an offence, though given unwarily; and
   finally, a love of converse, or delighting in each other's society, is
   another expression, as we observed, of that regard, which several
   persons have for one another. In all which respects it appears from
   constant observation and experience, that men are more disposed to shew
   love and respect to one another, than to God.

   As to the latter of these propositions, that all this proceeds for the
   most part from this cause, namely, that God is not seen by men as they
   are seen by one another, several propositions were first laid down for
   the explication of this point; and then two considerations for the
   eviction of it, tending to shew, that it must necessarily be from some
   great defect in the nature of man, that the most excellent and most
   amiable objects of all others, should not be generally loved by us.
   After which, two or three hints by way of use were given you, and so we
   concluded the last exercise on this subject.

   3. I now proceed to a larger and more close application of this
   important truth.

   (1.) Hence we infer, that man is in a very low and lapsed, state. The
   present state of man, I say, is a lapsed state. He is fallen, and
   fallen very low indeed, when this is the case with him, that he is less
   apt to love God than man; and only for this reason, because he cannot
   see God. It argues, I say, man to be sunk very low, and greatly fallen.
   And can we hereupon think otherwise? For what! can it ever enter into
   the imagination of any of us, that God did ever create such a thing as
   the reasonable intelligent spirit of man, his own off spring, image,
   and glory, with an original indisposition to the love of himself? Do we
   think that God gave such a nature to man at first, as was capable of
   being employed about spiritual objects, and yet with this strange
   defect or flaw in it, that it should be impossible to this nature of
   man to love the Author of itself, and the Original of its own life and
   being? This can not be. It can never be, that a reasonable spirit, the
   immediate issue of the great Father of spirits, should be so alienated
   from its own Father; and that it should be so dependent upon sense, as
   not to be able to love him from whom it came, or anything which is
   above the sphere of that base principle, which now presumes to give
   laws to the immortal mind. It is not to be supposed, that God ever
   created man so, as that his invisibility, which is the excellency of
   his own being, should be the reason why man should not love him. For he
   is therefore invisible, because he is excellent. And to think that the
   nature of man at first was so formed, that the excellency of things
   should be the reason why they should not be loved, and his own
   excellence a reason for his creature not to love him, is too absurd for
   any rational person to imagine. It is therefore plain, that the present
   state of man is a very lapsed state.

   Some of the heathen, as we observed before, have acknowledged and
   lamented this. We find one of them complaining, that the darkness of
   ignorance clouded his mind, and that this body and flesh was but as a
   living sepulchre to the man. Another complains of certain bonds and
   chains, that tied down tire mind of man to the body, and the things of
   sense. And a third speaking of the excellent state of man at first,
   says, that he then lived in a sort of familiarity and converse with
   God, but that now it was become quite otherwise with him. Such things
   as these we find in the writings of divers of the heathen. And how
   incongruous a thing is it for us who have all the concerns of our
   souls, and what relates to our being, so expressly discovered and made
   known to us; how incongruous a thing is it, I say, that such a malady
   as this should be so little minded as it is by us! Many have very
   slight notions of the degeneracy of man, and make a little matter of
   it, and the most have a much slighter sense thereof in practice. How
   few are there, who carry it as those who apprehend themselves fallen,
   and cast down from great excellencies! fallen short, very far short, of
   the glory of God! we live as if we apprehended no such malady, as if we
   knew not that there was a disease or distemper inwrought into our
   natures. Oh, how little is there of the sense of this to be found in
   the bulk of mankind! And hence I would farther infer,

   (2.) That this depravity or lapsedness of the nature of man consists
   greatly, in the depression and declination of his mind, and
   intellectual powers, as to the particular work and office of guiding
   his passions, his affections, and practical inclinations. This was just
   mentioned before in the last discourse, [20] but shall now be more
   largely considered. I do not say, with some, that this is all that is
   meant by the corrupt state of man; but certainly it stands very much in
   this, that his mind and rational powers are become unfit for their
   proper business; and, that sense hath got the throne, usurped the
   reins, and governs his passions and affections. Herein I say, consists,
   in very great part, the corruption and depravedness of man's present
   state. And do not we find it to be so? Do not we see, as to the objects
   that draw men's affections daily into a certain course that it is not
   the mind, but sense which prescribes? Sense dictates and says, "Love
   here," and they do accordingly: "Love not there," and they obey. "Let
   that be the object of your love, which sense tells you is amiable and
   lovely; and that which sense says no such thing about, you may slight,
   neglect, and take no further notice of." Thus men are dictated to, and
   they do accordingly. It is plain then, that the depravedness of man's
   state stands chiefly in this, that sense takes upon itself to do the
   business of the mind and intellectual powers, and we consent it should
   be so.

   But is not this a dismal thing? more dismal that it is not laid to
   heart! Is it not a dismal thing, I say, that the first rank and order
   of creatures in this sublunary world should be sunk into that low
   bestial life, so as to be governed by no higher a principle than what
   is common to them with brutes; and that the incongruity of this should
   not be reflected upon, and more deeply considered? That men should so
   seldom consider with themselves the unfitness of their course, or
   labour to shake off the usurped dominion over them? This, I say, is
   most sad and doleful to think on, that matters should have gone on thus
   from age to age, and from generation to generation, in so many
   successions to this day, and we have heard of so few in all that time,
   who have regretted to be so imposed upon, and forborne to live the life
   of beasts and brute creatures through so many ages! One would think it
   should some time or other have come into the mind of man, to think thus
   with himself. "What! is it a becoming thing for me, a reasonable and
   intelligent creature, one formed after the image and likeness of God,
   one of those creatures made at first for his immediate service and
   fellowship, that I must now be imposed upon, and dictated to by sense?
   that vile and base principle of sense, so as to love nothing but what
   that counts lovely, and neglect every thing which that takes no
   cognizance or notice of?" It is an amazing thing, that there should not
   be so much apprehensiveness left among men, as to remember, that they
   were men, in their original, once at least that they were men,
   "Remember," saith the prophet in a like case, "and shew yourselves
   men." Isa. xlvi. 8. But alas, how little is there left of a sense of
   this degeneracy among us! how little resentment of the vile indignity
   that is done to the whole kind, and which the whole species of men have
   suffered to come upon them! to be degraded and brought down into an
   inferior rank and order! to do, to act and live, as if they were also
   made to die like the beasts that perish!

   There are indeed many, in the mean time, who proudly arrogate and give
   to man that which belongs not to him in his present condition, and
   which this state does not admit of. They say him to be that which he is
   not, but in the mean time really see not, nor lament that he is neither
   what he was, nor what he should or ought to be. And to how little
   purpose is it to magnify human power, when it is manifest how forlorn
   the present state of man is? He is fallen very low! And what are these
   men intent upon, who make it their business now to magnify the nature
   and power of man in this condition? those parasites of mankind, as I
   may call them, what mean they by it? When he is become a lost perishing
   creature, they adorn him with shadows, and think they make up the
   matter by at tiring him with magnificent titles and attributes. As if
   when a person is condemned to suffer the execution of the sentence of
   death passed upon him, one should clothe him with a majestic robe, and
   bestow great compliments upon him. This is to add scorn to his ruin,
   and is only insulting over the wretchedness and calamity of the man's
   condition. And yet this is the course of them that go about to persuade
   man, that although the case is thus with him, he can recover his own
   excellence that he hath lost; that he can anew create himself, or
   repair the ruins of his decayed and shattered state. This is the way to
   add incurableness to his misery, by tempting him to neglect the only
   means of taking it off, and so make him miserable without remedy. But
   that persons out of a deep concern for the honour and glory of man as
   the top of the creation, should go about to make him believe himself
   now in an honourable state, and that he can even now do great things;
   now unsuitable and insignificant is this, as well as inconsistent with
   truth! And again,

   (3.) We infer hence, that man is most especially prejudiced and
   impaired by his lapse or fall, in respect to his disposition and
   inclinations towards God. The wound is principally in his mind, and
   consists in the depression and enfeebling of its powers; but the mind
   itself is most especially hurt and impaired in respect of those
   inclinations by which it should be guided towards God. For in the state
   in which he is at present he is indisposed to the love of God; and for
   this mean reason, because he cannot see him. And that he is not able to
   love what he cannot see, shews him to be a very mean abject creature,
   and that his powers are mightily impaired. Surely the time was, that he
   could have loved what he could not have seen with his bodily eye; and
   how comes it to pass that be cause he cannot see God, therefore he
   cannot love him? This shews that his mind is impaired, that he is hurt
   chiefly in what respects his Creator; and that his propensity, the bent
   and bias of his spirit towards God is lost.

   This is the sad and dismal thing that is befallen the nature of man,
   because God is far beyond the reach of his sight, and he himself is
   sunk into flesh, lost in earth, and always imposed upon by sense, he
   cannot see him, cannot lift up the dull heavy eye of his mind to his
   God, which is the eye he must be seen with by his creatures. So that,
   as the apostle Paul expresses it, he is become alienated from the life
   of God, and without God in the world. Eph. ii. 12. And how much is this
   to be lamented, that man is so fallen off from God! that his original
   propensity to him is lost and dropped from his nature! If we had heard
   but of one man since the creation of the world with whom this was the
   case, it would deserve to be very much lamented. But that this should
   come upon the whole kind, that it should be thus, as I may speak, with
   the whole race of men; methinks the sense of it should never wear off
   from our hearts. Strange! that it should be the course and fashion of
   this world all over the earth, to live in an oblivion of him that made
   us, and with hearts devoid of his love, and only because he is so
   excellent as not to be seen by us with the bodily eye! It was reckoned
   a sad and terrible day, when a tribe was cut off from Israel; but if we
   consider what man was made for, what were the design and end of his
   creation, we see as it were a whole race of beings lost from the
   creation of God. For what can we think man was made for but to love,
   admire, triumph, and glory in his great Maker? But to all this he is
   lost, and abstracting what is done in order to the recovering him
   again, it had been as well if there had been no men at all, and for
   themselves unspeakably better. How strange then is it, that such a
   matter as this is, should ever escape our thoughts! If we speak of the
   corruption and depravedness of human nature, they are words of course
   that drop from us now and then, and some slight notions of the matter
   hover in our minds; but how few are there to whom it is a familiar
   thing to roll themselves in the dust before the Lord, in the sense of
   that vile and abject state, which man in common now is in? How few
   lament that they are by the fall cut off from God; and spoiled as to
   all their capacities, whereby they were suited to the divine love,
   service and communion! And yet the most tragical calamities that could
   possibly have fallen out in the world, or of which we could form any
   imagination, had been nothing in comparison of this. Nay if all
   mankind, as to shape, or impossibility of external enjoyments, were the
   most monstrous and most miserable creatures living, it were nothing
   when compared to the mischief and misery, which are the fruits of man's
   apostacy from his Maker.

   (4.) We further infer hence, that man upon all these accounts must
   necessarily be at a very great distance from true blessedness. Whoever
   understands, or considers the connexion between blessedness and love,
   will soon perceive the reasonableness of this inference. It is
   impossible to be blessed without love; and it is necessary to every
   one's satisfaction, that it be a full and sufficient good that is the
   object of his love. If either of these be wanting, it is impossible it
   should be satisfying, or a suitable good to me. Or if on the other
   hand, there be a good never so self-sufficient or all-sufficient, yet
   if I can not love it, if my heart be averse to it, this also is a
   sufficient bar to my happiness. The things that are seen, though a man
   love them never so much, can never satisfy, because they are not
   sufficient. The infinite incomprehended good is all-sufficient, and fit
   for every purpose; but this cannot make him happy, because he doth not
   love it. In the creature therefore man cannot be happy, in God he will
   not. He cannot in the creature, because that hath not in itself to
   give; in God he will not, because his heart is disinclined to him, and
   will not be brought to a closure with him by love.

   Consider man according to this state of his case, and you must look
   upon him as one, who by his very constitution and present temper of his
   soul, is formed for misery; I say so long as he continues in his
   present situation. His heart inclines him truly to visible things, and
   to love the objects of sense, which can never make him happy. The good
   that is unseen hath enough in it to make him blessed, but then he will
   not love it. He will not apply himself to love God, merely because he
   is out of sight. You must needs think then that it is a great thing
   that must work the cure of man, who is thus involved in so great an
   abyss of depravedness and misery. And therefore I must add,

   (5.) That there is a very great necessity of much gospel-preaching in
   order to persuade men to the love of God. For what is the design of the
   gospel, but to render God amiable to men? What is it but a method of
   rendering God lovely, and of restoring men's love to God? And since his
   loveliness is not the object of sight, there needs such a supplemental
   representation of himself, to supply the want of vision. And since the
   things that court our senses are obvious, and occur to us every day,
   yea every hour of the day, it is needful that we should be frequently
   put in mind of God; and that those discoveries of him which tend to
   beget the love of him in our hearts, should be very much urged and
   inculcated upon us. For otherwise what should countervail sense, or
   what shall we set against the sight of our own eyes? "No man hath seen
   God, at any time." What is it then that must supply that defect, and be
   in the stead of the sight of God to us? Why, "the only begotten Son of
   God, he hath declared him." John i. 18. So that we have now a
   revelation of God himself. And our Lord Jesus Christ, who lay in his
   bosom, and came from thence to declare the Father to the world, has
   ordained that this revelation, of which he is the prime Author, shall
   be held out before us from time to time, by the use of inferior and
   subservient instruments.

   I have often considered the strange prevarication, and sophistry, which
   some men use in stating things that are necessary to salvation; and the
   use they make of that state. That is, because they can make a shift to
   gather up the main principles of religion into a little compass, as
   they may very easily, they say, "Here is all that is necessary to
   salvation. And therefore since in that way, or in that church all
   things necessary to salvation are taught, what need is there of any
   more? why should not we come over thither? or why should we separate
   from it?" Methinks it were an obvious easy thing to most people to
   detect the fallacy. They state what is objectively necessary to
   salvation, without considering the condition of the subject, and what
   is necessary for that subject. That is, they state what is necessary to
   be known and believed in order to our being saved, but consider not
   what is necessary to bring men to this knowledge and belief of these
   necessary things, so as to make a due impression of them upon their
   hearts. If, for instance, you were to prescribe to a sick languishing
   person a remedy for the taking off his distemper; would you only tell
   him of such and such good substantial food that you would have him eat?
   and would you then think you had done the business? Alas! the poor man
   is sick; he desires nothing, can take nothing, can digest nothing, and
   casts up all you give him. Why then do you talk to him of such things
   as will make wholesome and substantial food, when he can neither
   receive nor retain it! So in like manner in the present case and
   exigence of man, considered as a fallen creature, if the bare proposal
   of the sundry heads of religion, necessary to be known and believed
   were sufficient; then to have a sermon once in a man's life time might
   do the business; or a mere system of the principal parts of the
   Christian religion would do what it is urged for, and answer the
   exigence of the case. This, I say, were a thing easily to be granted,
   if it were really so with men, that a doctrine would be understood as
   soon as proposed, and received when understood, and so beget its due
   and proper impression, upon the hearts of men. But truly the case is
   manifestly otherwise, since man is fallen into so depraved a state. And
   to talk thus, is to speak of a scheme of divinity suitable only to
   innocent men in paradise; when no more was needful to be done than
   barely to propound things with respect to the clearness of the
   understanding, the rectitude of the will, the agreeableness of the
   powers one to another, together with the truth and goodness of their
   objects. But to say that this is all that is requisite, that there is
   enough held forth or laid before men, the knowledge and belief of which
   is sufficient to save them, is just as if one should say, that such and
   such things proposed to a sick man would do him good if lie were not
   sick. So in like manner this way of propounding the gospel would serve
   the turn for men, if they were such as when they were at first created.
   Indeed it were no gospel, if it were only enough to save men from sin,
   who as yet were no sinners. The very notion implies a contradiction.
   For doth not the same sin which makes them stand in need of a gospel
   for the reconciling them to God, disaffect at the same time their
   hearts unto God, and make them unwilling to close with him? Therefore
   they need to have precept upon precept, and line upon line; here a
   little, and there a little. And they that preach the gospel to men, are
   urged "to be instant in season and out of season, to admonish, exhort,
   reprove:" (2 Tim. iv. 2.) and all little enough, indeed all too little.

   Surely then there is somewhat else to be considered in the matter. When
   we consider what is objectively necessary, it is also to be considered
   what will bring men to believe these necessary things. And in order to
   that there is need of their being frequently inculcated, inasmuch as
   things that are seen are more the objects of our love, than the things
   which are not seen; and what we ought to set our hearts most upon, are
   out of sight. God himself is the great Object men are to be directed
   to, and to whom they must be united, or they are lost. He is invisible,
   and they are apt, as you have heard again and again, to mind nothing
   but what is seen. There fore it is a strange unapprehensiveness of the
   real state and condition of mankind, which those are guilty of, who
   decry preaching as a needless thing. Surely they that do so, have
   little studied the nature of man! There are several other things that
   remain to be spoken to, which I cannot insist upon at this time.

SERMON IV. [21]

   WE have gone through the first part of my design from these words,
   which was to shew, that men are less apt or disposed to the exercise of
   love to God than to one another. And we have made some progress in the
   application, by way of inference; and therein have endeavoured to
   shew,--that the in disposition of man to the love of God is a proof of
   his being in a lapsed and very degenerate condition--that this
   degeneracy must consist principally in the depression of the mind and
   its intellectual powers--that more especially man is prejudiced by the
   lapse or fall with respect to his inclinations towards God--that in
   consequence of this, he must needs be at a great distance from true
   blessedness, which is inseparably connected with the love of God--and
   in the next place, it was further inferred, that there is great
   occasion for frequent gospel-preaching, which is the method instituted
   by Christ for restoring and reviving love to God in the souls of men.
   But though this is necessary, yet we are also to know that it is net
   sufficient; for all the preaching in the world cannot alone make the
   sensual heart of men to love God. And therefore we proceed to infer
   further,

   (6.) That since men are so very unapt to love God, and for this reason,
   because they see him not; there is great need of the communication and
   influence of that glorious and mighty Spirit of life to relieve him in
   this sad extremity and distress. For surely it is a very distressed
   case, that man cannot love his own Maker, the Author of his life and
   being, him in whom. is his eternal hope, and all because he cannot see
   him. It is a case that calls. for a very great and powerful hand to
   redress; and no other hand is proportionable to the exigence thereof.
   Though he works by means, and even by that of the gospel-revelation,
   yet it doth not follow that the means will do the business alone; but
   the contrary follows, that because they are means, therefore there must
   be an agent, and an efficient, to use them, and one proportionable to
   the work of forming and disposing the spirits of men towards God, that
   they may be capable of his love, and admit it into their hearts so as
   to rule and govern there. And what can do this but the Spirit of God?
   What else is it that can awaken and rouse the dull, sluggish, drowsy
   spirits of men? What else, I say, can quicken, purify, and refine
   spirits lost in pleasure and sense? The way of bringing any soul to
   love God, is to give it the spirit of love. There is no other way of
   doing it. Now the apostle says, that "God hath given to us not the
   spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind." [22]
   One and the same Spirit is all these at once. And till that Spirit is
   given us, there is nothing but enmity and disaffection towards God;
   there is nothing but feebleness and impotence, as to any thing that is
   good; there is nothing but distemperature and diseasedness in man,
   which have pierced him to the very heart. This Spirit therefore, in
   reference to these several exigencies, is a Spirit of love, of power,
   and of a sound mind. That same Spirit that makes the soul capable now
   of doing things that require power; that same Spirit that rectifies the
   mind, and heals it of those distempers under which it was wasting and
   consuming before, is a SPIRIT OF LOVE. It is said to be a Spirit given,
   a Spirit superadded to our own, a Spirit that we had not before. Indeed
   it must be some other spirit than ours, which must render us capable of
   loving God.

   You know, that the apostle recounting the several fruits of the Spirit,
   (as he had done those of the flesh before) sets this of love in the
   front of them. "The fruit of the Spirit is love joy, &c." [23] And
   after telling us, that "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
   entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
   them that love him;" [24] he tells us also of a Spirit different from
   that of the world, the Spirit which is of God, which such as they had
   received. "We have received," says he, "not the spirit of the world,
   but the Spirit which is of God." [25] And in this same chapter, wherein
   is our text, you have the apostle John speaking to this very case, to
   wit, the impossibility of our seeing God: "No man hath seen God at any
   time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is
   perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us,
   because he hath given us of his Spirit." [26] Love to one another as
   Christians or saints, is also a fruit of that same blessed Spirit. And
   if there be such a principle of love within us, it plainly speaks that
   God dwells in us, and we in him, and that he hath planted his own love
   in our souls, which is perfecting there. It is manifest now that he
   hath taken possession of us, and drawn us into union with himself, so
   as to become the great Fountain of that principle of love in us,
   whereby we are capable of loving him, and loving such as are his, for
   his sake.

   And because the act of the heart in loving supposes some foregoing act
   of the mind by which the object is perceived to be lovely, therefore
   this same Spirit is elsewhere called "A Spirit of wisdom, and
   revelation, in the knowledge of him, whom we are to love." [27] The
   apostle is there praying earnestly on be half of the Ephesians, that
   this Spirit might be given them, by which they might be capable of
   knowing, and knowing practically, as the word epignosis signifies, and
   of coming into union with that blessed One that is known. And on this
   union love hath a great influence. St. John says, "We know the Son of
   God is come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know him
   that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus
   Christ. That is the true God and eternal life." [28] The understanding
   here spoken of is said to be given by which we so come to know God in
   Christ, as to be brought into union with him by love: it is, I say, a
   given thing, men have it not of themselves.

   It is very requisite, and therefore I so long insist upon it, that we
   understand how necessary it is, that there be another and a better
   Spirit than our own, to render us capable of loving God, whom we have
   not seen; for otherwise we shall never love beyond the sight of our own
   eye. And it is very strange, that this necessity, since the case speaks
   itself, and the Holy Scriptures so often declare it, should be no more
   understood. If there be no such necessity, what is the reason we are
   taught to "pray for the Spirit," [29] as starving children do for
   bread? That we are bid to "live in the Spirit," [30] "to walk in the
   Spirit," [31] and "by the Spirit to mortify the deeds of the flesh?"
   [32] And are we not told, that we must "be born of the Spirit, or else
   we shall never enter into the kingdom of God?" John iii. 3. All this is
   plain language one would think, and easy enough to be understood by
   those that have a mind to it. But it is very observable, that those
   notions which tend to make as little as possible of the depravity and
   corruption of man's nature, to magnify beyond measure the power of man
   in his fallen state, to depress preaching, and to make light of the
   operations of the Holy Ghost upon the minds of men, are all of a sort,
   ail of a piece. These are notions that hang upon one thread, and when
   we see wherein they issue and terminate, we may easily discern the
   danger of them; and into how great hazard they bring the eternal
   concerns of the souls of those men, who suffer themselves to be tainted
   with them. We again farther infer,

   (7.) That the work of regeneration must needs stand in very great part
   in the implanting and seating in the souls of men such principles, as
   may directly tend to control the dictates of sense, and in opposition
   to it rule and govern in men. The infirmity and distemper of man's
   nature easily shew, wherein this cure and renovation must consist. This
   is at present the great distemper of his soul, it cannot love but where
   it can see. It is the sight of the eye that carries the heart, and
   draweth it this way and that way. A most dreadful distemper this! But
   as we know the distemper, we know wherein the cure must consist.
   Regeneration is that which restores the man to his right mind, and sets
   things to rights again with him. Though his former state is expressed
   by being in the flesh, he is now said to be in the Spirit, from the
   spiritual frame created in him by the great work of regeneration. Thus,
   says the apostle, "Ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be
   that the Spirit of God dwell in you." Rom. viii. 9. And the thing
   produced in the work of regeneration is called spirit. "That which is
   born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is
   spirit." John iii. 6. While man is in flesh he is capable of loving
   nothing but what is seen, nothing but what to his senses appears
   amiable and lovely. Herein therefore stands the work of regeneration,
   to take a poor sensual creature, a mere lump of flesh, and to make him
   spiritual; and then it is he becomes capable of loving God. There must
   be a new creation: and right principles planted in the mind, to
   influence the heart, and to direct and determine souls towards God,
   from whom they were cut off and so dreadfully alienated. Again in the

   (8.) Place, we further infer, that the power by which it comes to pass
   that there are any lovers of God in the world is highly to be adored
   and magnified. You see it is far more difficult to love God, whom we
   see not, than our brother whom we do see. How then can this difficulty
   be overcome, unless divine power implant this principle of love? We
   ought therefore to make the representation of that power, that hath
   wrought this work in us, appear very glorious in our own eyes, that so
   with reference to this matter our hearts may be put in an adoring
   posture. Let us then bless and adore that glorious Being, who hath done
   such a thing as this; who hath made a stupid sensual heart, which could
   never rise beyond the sphere of flesh, ascend and enlarge itself, and
   fix and terminate its love upon the blessed God. "How great is the
   power" (should one say that finds it thus) "which hath done this in me!
   to make a clod of earth, a lump of clay to love God! This is as great a
   thing as out of tones to raise up children unto Abraham." In reality we
   ought not to think little, or meanly of this. And again,

   (9.) We may further infer, that the life of Christians in this world
   cannot but be a conflicting life. The life of a christian as such must
   be influenced throughout by the love of God. He is to act according to
   the direction of St. Jude, "Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking
   for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life." John iii.
   21. Is this the business of a christian, and what must be his very life
   to live in the love of God all along? then he must indeed live a
   conflicting life all his days. That is, there must be a continual
   conflict kept up against imperious sense, and its dictates, which
   always is crying to the heart of man, "Love what is seen, what you
   perceive to be lovely:" there must, I say, be a continual striving in
   the heart of a christian against this; since he must keep up a
   continual love to him whom he cannot see, to him who is far above out
   of sight.

   This sheweth, that they who know not what a continual striving against
   sense, its dictates, and inclinations means, are yet to learn what the
   business of the Christian life is. How can a man love God whom he seeth
   not? When there is a continual difficulty, there must be a continual
   striving and vigorous endeavours always used. Loving God is not
   swimming down with the stream of nature, it is quite another thing. And
   agreeable to this, what a strife is represented all along, through out
   the seventh chapter of the epistle to the Romans, between the "law of
   the flesh," and the "law of the mind;" the inclinations of sensual
   nature, and the spiritual dictates and prescriptions which are by the
   apostle called "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus;" [33]
   which doth as it were repeal, and abrogate the law of sin and death;
   and so far as it obtains, delivers a man from its impositions, and
   imperious commands, which lead to death.

   It is highly needful for us to state our own case to ourselves, and to
   consider what we are like to meet with in our Christian course; and if
   we mean to persevere, we must resolve upon a striving conflicting life
   all our days, for thus it must be. How much then are they beside the
   Christian course, who know not what it is to strive against any
   inclination of their own, nor to oppose the earthly tendencies of their
   own spirits; who can never find occasion to contend with themselves;
   who espy no fault in the temper of their own spirits, but carry the
   matter to themselves as if all were well; who can pass a whole day with
   no rebukes nor checks, when their hearts have run after their eyes
   only! These persons perhaps have never minded, never loved any thing
   better than what came within the reach of their senses, or could be
   seen with the eye; and yet they are innocent creatures in their
   imagination, and think they have no cause to blame themselves. But let
   us not be deceived, who see that the life of a christian must be a
   continual running counter to a man's own eyes, and the dictates of
   sense; since these prescribe to a man to love only what he sees,
   whereas certainly he is no christian who liveth not in the love of God
   whom he doth not see. In the

   (10.) Place, we further infer, that the proneness of men to acquiesce
   in a civil deportment, and to rest in the mere formalities of religion,
   hath one fixed common cause, and that is, the want of the great
   principle of love. In this respect it is fit that we should consider
   what the case of man is. Men are very apt to satisfy themselves with a
   fair and unexceptionable carriage to others, or at most with a little
   formality in the duties of religion, and never look further; which
   certainly must proceed from one and the same cause, namely, the want of
   love to God. This, I say, in the

   [1.] Place, is the reason why persons are so prone to acquiesce in a
   fair and civil deportment towards men. It is necessary for us to know
   this, that so the danger of it may be more care fully avoided and
   deeply dreaded. What is it that is really the principle of duty even
   towards men? Certainly it is love. This is easy, as the text supposes,
   towards men, in comparison of what it is towards God; men therefore are
   apt to take up with what they find most easy.

   The state of the case lieth thus. There are characters of the ancient
   law, which God at the creation impressed upon the spirit of man; Lex
   non scripta sed nata! the law not written, but born with us, as one
   heathen writer expresses it, or the nomos phusikos, natural law, as
   another heathen writer calls it. There are, I say, still some broken
   parts, some scattered fragments, some dispersed characters of this law,
   which was by our Maker put into our very frame, which lie discomposed
   and dispersed here and there in men, whereof some refer to our duty
   towards God, and others to our duty towards men. Those relating to men
   are more legible, are oftener read, and come more frequently under
   view. For how much more prevalent is this sense in the minds of men,
   "My neighbour is not to be wronged or disobliged," than this, "God is
   not to be forgotten, neglected, disobeyed?" Why, the matter being so,
   that the characters representing our duty to men are oftener in view,
   and so more frequently furbished as it were and brightened, than those
   which express our duty to God; being, I say, more frequently reflected
   upon, they are more put into practice. And therefore here men are apt
   to take up, saying, "I do that which is just, honest, and fair before
   men, and there are none that can charge me with the contrary." And so
   they think their case is good.

   Indeed there are several things concurring to make such principles, as
   point out to us the duties we owe to man, more influential upon
   practice. As for instance, men have sensible kindnesses from one
   another, which work upon ingenuity, and so influence to a suitable
   behaviour to them that shew such kindnesses. When they receive a
   kindness from the hand of a man, it is from a visible hand. They see
   who doth them good. Though there is a thousand times more good done
   them by the invisible God, but his invisible hand they take no notice
   of.

   Again, they are sensible continually of their need of men. All persons
   sensibly find they need some other, for they cannot live alone. They
   are not only obliged to a mutual dependence upon one another, but they
   are very sensible of it; and therefore are very apt to carry it so much
   the more fairly to men, as those who stand in need of one another.

   Besides, men find a sensible advantage from the reputation of a fair,
   just, and honest carriage to others. "If I have not the repute of being
   a person kind, goodnatured and well-humoured, I shall have no friend;
   no body will converse with me, but be shy of me. If I have not the
   reputation of being a just man, honest and square in all my dealings, I
   shall have no trade, no one will trust me, every one will be afraid to
   hare to do with me." These considerations dispose us to good behaviour
   towards one another.

   Finally, men are frequently sensible of hurt or some great
   inconveniencies accruing to them, if at any time they misbehave
   themselves to others. They that are morose and churlish do often fall
   upon tempers as cross-grained and perverse as their own, and so meet
   with such measure as they bring. If they be quarrelsome, it falls out
   sometimes that there are those who will quarrel with them, and will not
   take an affront at their hands. And though there are some that scorn
   the tutor age and instruction of fear, which should govern them in the
   conduct of their affairs; yet many others are more prudent, and are not
   apt to follow the hurry of their own pride and inclinations. They
   consider how much it concerns them, not to provoke those who will right
   themselves, nor to injure those who will be sure to meet with them one
   time or other. Yea, those who are more considerate will be very
   cautious how they make any man their enemy, even the meanest; for no
   man is so mean but it may be sometime or other in his power to do him a
   shrewd turn.

   Such inducements there are, I say, as these unto a fair and
   unexceptionable deportment towards men, whom we see and converse with
   every day. And with this men are inclined to take up their rest;
   contenting and satisfying themselves with this, that they carry it to
   others, so as that none have any great reason to find fault with them,
   and thereupon think that God will find none neither.

   [2.] There is also a proneness in mankind, as we observed, to take up
   with formality in the matters of religion. For what besides formality
   can there be in the religion of those who love not God? If I pretend to
   worship him and not love him, though I spend all my days upon my knees
   will it signify any thing as to real religion? But because this is more
   easy, that is, bodily exercise than that of love, or an inclination of
   mind and heart to God, it is natural to take up with it for that
   reason, and to rest there.

   The pharisees among the Jews, one would think should not have been to
   seek where religion really lay; but, alas! where did they place
   their's? In ceremonial sanctity, in washing their hands before they did
   eat bread, in cleansing their cups and platters, and in frequent
   purifications of themselves; all which they made to be as significant
   things, as the instituted rites of worship by God himself. Moreover
   they were very exact in tithing mint, rue, and all manner of herbs,
   while in the mean time they "passed over judgment and the love or God."
   Luke ii. 42. What a strange oversight was this! that the pharisees,
   those devout men, those zealous pretenders to the greatest strictness
   in the observance of the law of God, as well as to the profoundest
   knowledge of it, even beyond all other men, should be guilty of such an
   oversight as to pass over the sum and substance of it, to wit, the love
   of God! And yet our Saviour speaks of it as their common character. If
   then the pharisees, those knowing and strict men, as they would be
   thought to be, were in such an error as this so commonly, we may well
   conclude that the spirits of men are generally prone to acquiesce in
   the mere externals of religion, and to take up with the outside thereof
   without ever going any further. They think their case is well enough
   with God if now and then they bow the knee, compliment him in duty, and
   put on some face and shew of devotion; while in the mean time the love
   of God is an unthought-of thing. So that how many must say, if they
   would speak as their case truly is, "I never thought that the love of
   God must go into my worship." Since then the proneness of mankind to
   acquiesce in a fair and civil deportment, and in the mere formalities
   of religion proceeds from one common, fixed cause, to wit, the want of
   this divine principle of love, it is necessary that we consider the
   matter, lest we ourselves be thus dreadfully imposed upon.

   And now to conclude the First Part of our subject, it appears that
   temptations to atheism must needs find great advantages in the temper
   of men's spirits, while they are so depressed and overborne by sense.
   For its essence, particularly of practical atheism, consists in the
   alienation of the heart from God. And how easy a step is it from hence
   to speculative atheism, when a man has lived so long "without God
   (atheoi, the apostle's phrase is.) in the world!" Eph. ii. 12. For if
   he do not love God whom he hath not seen, for the same reason he will
   not fear him; neither hope nor rejoice in him as his chief good. How
   obvious is it for such a man to entertain such a thought as this? "Is
   it not as good to say, there is no God, or I will own none; as to say
   there is no one that I will love or fear, nor any one with the thoughts
   of whom my heart is at any time affected?"

   Let us therefore hence take occasion to admire the patience and much
   more the bounty of God towards his revolted creatures in this world.
   How wonderful is it that he spares and maintains them also! that he
   should make constant provision for such as put the highest affronts and
   indignities upon him, by loving and preferring his own dust, before him
   who formed it into what it is; by exalting the work of his hands above
   him; and finally, by profusely bestowing their affections on the
   creature, but none upon God the great Creator of all! Do not we think
   this is a thing not to be endured? and do not we wonder that it is
   actually endured and that men are permitted from age to age, to
   continue in this course, and are suffered by vengeance to live, when
   the whole business of their lives is to express how much more they
   value despicable nothings, creatures like themselves, than the great,
   the blessed, and glorious Lord of heaven and earth! Certainly it should
   be often our business to set ourselves to admire the sparing and
   sustaining mercy which God exerciseth towards this world while this is
   the state of things between him and apostate men.

SERMON V. [34]

   WE have hitherto been shewing you from these words, That men are less
   apt to love God than one another, principally for this reason, because
   God is not the object of sight as men are. We are now to go on to the

   SECOND thing observed from them, namely, That we are most indispensably
   obliged to the exercise of this duty though we see him not, and
   therefore notwithstanding this excuse, it is a most intolerable thing
   not to love God.

   This hath its manifest ground in the text, and doth fundamentally
   belong to the apostle's reasoning in this place. For the argument or
   medium which he reasons from is this, that if we do not love our
   brother whom we have seen, then we can not so much as love God whom we
   have not seen. By which he endeavours to represent how grievous a thing
   it would be, if Christians should continue in a mutual neglect of one
   another. Now all this would fall to the ground, and signify nothing, if
   they were disengaged from loving God upon the account of his
   invisibility. But the apostle takes it for granted, that all men must
   esteem it a most horrid thing to be convicted of not loving God;
   otherwise his argument would be altogether to no purpose. For it might
   have been replied to him, "Though we be convicted of this, that we do
   not love God, inasmuch as we do not love one another, yet what is the
   inconvenience of such a neglect? We grant the whole, but what are the
   ill consequences that follow upon it?" Now the apostle doubts not but
   they would see the consequences, and that every man must needs take it
   to be an intolerably hateful thing to pass for one that is no lover of
   God. This therefore is supposed by the apostle as a fundamental
   circumstance in his discourse--that not to love God, though we see him
   not, is a most horrid hateful thing, as well as absolutely inexcusable.

   Now as this is plainly to be collected, so it is very necessary to be
   insisted upon. For as it is apparent, that as men commonly do not love
   God, or at least are less disposed to it, be cause they see him not; so
   they are very apt to excuse and exempt themselves from guilt upon this
   account. "Why should I look upon it, says one, as so abominable a thing
   not to live in the exercise of love to God? He is out of sight, sure he
   expects no such thing from us who cannot see him, and who live at so
   great a distance from him!"--What multitudes are there who can wear out
   the whole time of life, and never charge themselves with any fault all
   their days for not having lived in the love of God? As if the old
   heathenish maxim were their settled notion, Quae supra nos, nihil ad
   nos: we have nothing to do with what is so far above us.

   And besides, this is not only the latent sense of most, or that which
   lies closely wrapt up even in the very inwards of their souls, to wit,
   that they have little to do with God, and need not concern themselves
   about him; but it is also what many have the confidence to speak out,
   and to declare in plain express words. It is very notorious that there
   are sundry persons in the world, not of one denomination or party only
   among the professors of the Christian name, who are not afraid to avow
   this very sense. Those who have made it their concern to look into the
   doctrines that have been handed about in the Christian world, do well
   know whose casuistical divinity this is, "That we are not obliged to
   love God, unless it be once or twice a year." Or as some have presumed
   to say, "If it be only once in a man's life-time it may serve the
   turn," as a worthy person, now removed from us, hath largely shewn; as
   also what the morals and practical divinity of that sort of men are.
   And another [35] of quite a different strain, who hath disciples more
   than a good many in our time, in his discourse of the human nature,
   would slily insinuate, that we are not obliged at all to formal direct
   acts of love to God, from this very passage of Scripture in the next
   chapter of this epistle, This is the love of God, that we keep his
   commandments. [36] As if because the apostle would there include all
   the external effects virtually in the principle, it was therefore fit
   to exclude the principle itself by the external effects. Nor indeed was
   there ever any time or age wherein the heart and life of practical
   religion and godliness were so openly struck at as in our days, by the
   perverse notions of some, and the scorn of others: as if it were
   thought a very feasible thing to jeer religion out of the world; and
   that men ought to be ashamed to profess love to God, because they can
   have the impudence and be so daring as to laugh at this and such like
   things.

   We are therefore so much the more concerned to bestir ourselves, and to
   look more narrowly into the very grounds and bottom of our own practice
   in the ways of religion. We are to consider whether indeed we have a
   reason to oblige us to be godly, yea or no; and especially is it
   incumbent upon us to defend this great principle and summary of all
   godliness, The love of God. For certainly if we must yield to the
   extinction of this principle, if a love to God may be banished from
   among us, we turn all our religion into nothing else, but a mere piece
   of pageantry. How vain and foolish, how absurd and ridiculous things
   were the forms of religion, which we keep up from time to time,
   supposing this great radical principle was to have no place nor
   exercise among us! To come together, and make a shew of devotion to him
   whom we do not love, nor think ourselves obliged to love, is nothing
   but inconsistency and contradiction. And those who come on such terms,
   as oft as they undertake to worship God, must needs offer nothing but
   the sacrifices of fools. But it is our business to defend this
   principle; to vindicate it against every thing that can be alleged
   against it by those who would excuse themselves from the obligation to
   this duty, from their not seeing God. And that we may the more fitly
   prosecute the present design, we shall endeavour to do these two
   things.

   I. To shew the vanity and impertinence of this excuse for not loving
   God, to wit, our not seeing him.

   II. To demonstrate the intolerable heinousness of this sin
   notwithstanding, and to shew its horrid nature though God is not
   visible to us. Because persons are apt upon this ground or reason
   either totally to excuse themselves, as if there were no iniquity at
   all in it; as there are multitudes of people who can pass over their
   days one after another, without any emotion of heart to love towards
   God at all: or else because if they cannot obtain of themselves against
   the clearest light to believe it is no sin; yet they would fain have it
   to be only a peccadillo, or a very little one. "God, say they, cannot
   expect much love from those, who cannot see him! or that such beings to
   whom he is invisible should mind him much, or concern themselves with
   him from day to day!" Therefore, I say, we shall endeavour both to
   shew, how most impertinently this is alleged as an excuse for not
   loving God, or how unreasonable it is to infer from his invisibility,
   that we are under no such obligation, and after that, to represent to
   you the hateful nature of the sin; or to shew, that if we love not God,
   it is not only a sin notwithstanding this pretence, but a most
   prodigious and horrid one too.

   I. That we may evince to you the vanity of this excuse, or the
   impertinency of alleging that we are not obliged to love God, because
   we see him not, there are these two things that we charge this excuse
   with, and shall labour to make out concerning it; to wit, that it is
   both invalid and absurd. It is in valid, because it hath nothing in it
   which a valid excuse ought to have. And it is monstrously absurd, and
   draws most in tolerable ill consequences after it, if such an excuse
   should be admitted in such a case.

   1. I shall shew the insufficiency of this excuse, or that it is vain
   and hath nothing in it which a valid excuse should have. "We do not see
   God, therefore we are not concerned to love him." This will easily be
   made out to you thus. Whenever any thing is charged upon us by a law,
   and the exception lies not against the authority of the lawgiver, but
   only the matter of the law as applied to us, no excuse can be valid in
   that case, but where the matter brought in excuse shall be able to
   prove one of these two things: either that what is enjoined, is in
   itself impossible to us, or at least that it is unfit and unreasonable
   to be expected from us. But our not seeing God can never infer either
   of these. It neither renders our loving him impossible; nor unfit and
   unreasonable, supposing it to be possible.

   (1.) Our not seeing God doth not render our loving him impossible. This
   it is needful for us rightly to understand before we proceed any
   further. The thing that we intend to make out to you is, not that it is
   possible to us to love God by our own natural power. You have heard
   already enough to the contrary. He can never be truly loved by us, till
   the Spirit of love is given us; which is also at the same time a Spirit
   of power, and of a sound mind. Till then, I say, it is impossible that
   any should love God. But when he implants this principle in us, he doth
   not therefore render himself visible to our bodily eye, which is the
   seeing here meant, for we must understand the word in the same sense in
   both parts of the test. All that we have to evince then is, that our
   not seeing God as we do our brother, does not make it impossible for us
   to love him. So that our present inquiry is not concerning the power,
   that gives the principle of love; but only concerning the means that
   should be made use of, in order to the begetting or planting that
   principle. Which being understood, the several considerations following
   will plainly evince to us, that our not seeing God doth not render it
   impossible for us to love him,

   [1.] Consider that the sight of our eye is not the immediate cause, or
   inducement of love to any thing, but only a means to beget an
   apprehension in our minds of the loveliness of the object. And then it
   is, that is, upon the perception of this loveliness, that we are
   brought to love the object itself. For after the sight of the eye there
   must pass in the mind an act of the judgment upon the object, before we
   can be brought to love it; otherwise we should love or hate every thing
   that we see promiscuously, and not distinguish objects of love, from
   objects of hatred. It is only the apprehension of the mind, even in
   reference to objects of sight, that brings us to love them. If there be
   any other means of begetting an apprehension in our mind concerning
   such and such objects, that they are lovely and fit to be loved, it is
   not necessary that we should see them with our eyes. To this we add,

   [2.] There are other sufficient means to possess our minds with an
   apprehension of the loveliness of an object, and more especially those
   objects that are never liable to the sight of our eye. We do not need
   to insist much on so plain a case. It is plain that there are sundry
   ways, by which the apprehension of the loveliness even of an invisible
   object, may come to have place in us; invisible at least so far as to
   be out of the reach of our eye. To be a little particular here:

   There is, for instance, with respect to the unseen God naturally a
   divine impression upon the minds of men, by which, when they are put
   upon reflection, they must needs own that he is not only a lovely, but
   the most lovely and amiable Object, and has the best right to claim
   their love. Whosoever they are that do acknowledge a God, [37] must
   also read such attributes and properties of the being of God engraven
   there, importing that he is the first and supreme Object of our love.
   No one that acknowledgeth a God but presently acknowledgeth too, that
   he is good; that he is true; that he is holy; that he is wise; and the
   like. And then his own heart must tell him, whether he will or no, that
   he ought to be loved above all.

   Again, our own-reasonings from the manifest visible effects and
   characters of divine wisdom, and power, and goodness, that are to be
   seen every where, may also beget an apprehension or judgment in us that
   he should and ought to be loved. Do we live in a world full of the
   divine glory, that arrayeth and clotheth every thing we can cast our
   eyes upon; and do we want ground to perceive, that this is the lovely
   Object that ought to captivate all hearts, and draw into a closure with
   itself the will of every intelligent creature? Moreover,

   The express testimony of the gospel is another means more apt still to
   beget this apprehension within us, that God is one we should love, and
   whose excellencies do every way entitle him, with a most indisputable
   right, to the highest degree and supremacy of our love. "No man hath
   seen God at any time." What then? Is it therefore impossible that he
   should be loved? Hath not "his only begotten Son, who was in the bosom
   of the Father, declared or revealed him?" John i. 18. Surely he hath
   made such a declaration of him, given such a prospect and view of him
   to the world, as that every one who will believe a God, and receive his
   report, must confess him to be the most amiable and excellent Being.
   Here all hearts ought to meet and unite; and this ought to be the
   universal centre of love. "He is in Christ reconciling the world to
   himself;" (2 Cor. v. 19.) giving mankind a lovely prospect of himself.
   And in him, who is the Emmanuel, God with us, he is ready to
   communicate himself, and to draw souls into union with him, and to a
   participation of his own likeness and felicity. Who then is there but
   must acknowledge, that upon this representation he lays a just claim to
   our highest love? Finally,

   There is also the inward revelation of the Holy Ghost, by which the
   want of seeing God is abundantly supplied. It is true, this Spirit of
   wisdom and revelation, by which we come to the practical knowledge of
   God so as to love him, is but the portion of a few. But it is in the
   mean time the great fault and wickedness of every one who seeks it not,
   values it not, and makes it not his business, with an earnest and
   restless importunity to sue for it till it is obtained. God hath given
   no man any cause to despair; but if he seek that Spirit, by which he
   may be so known as to be certainly loved, he hath given him ground to
   hope that he shall have that knowledge of him, which shall be
   efficacious of that love. God has given no ground to any to despair, or
   fear that they shall seek in vain; but as our Saviour says in this very
   case, If they seek, they shall find, for he is more ready to give the
   Holy Spirit, than parents are to give bread rather than a stone to
   their children, Matt. vii. 7-11. And now that there are so many ways
   for conveying the apprehension into the mind, which is to be the
   immediate parent of love, to wit, that this Object is most amiable; it
   is most evident, that the not seeing God, doth not render it impossible
   for him to be loved. And we may further consider to this purpose,

   [3.] That in sundry cases besides, other means than sight, do suffice
   to convey such apprehensions into the mind, as to excite and raise
   proportionable affections in the soul. Then why should it not be so in
   this case? For what can any man say why he ought not to be moved by
   such apprehensions concerning God, as are by other means brought into
   his mind than by sight? What! do you love nothing? do you never find
   your hearts taken with any thing but that which your eyes have seen? Is
   it an impossible thing, or what your ears never heard of, for a person
   to love only upon report, as being informed of such, and such
   excellencies and perfections in the object? Have not many been taken
   with the description of a country they have not seen? Or do we think it
   impossible for a blind man t love his children, his wife, his friend?
   Do we imagine that such persons, because they can see nothing, can
   therefore love nothing? Do you not love your life? You cannot see that,
   but only in the effects; and in the effects also you may see the
   blessed God himself, who is the life of your life. And who can deny,
   that they have notions in their own minds of things that are altogether
   unliable to sight: which, if they will but ask themselves the question,
   they must acknowledge to be lovely, and which many are actually brought
   to love. For instance: the notions of truth; the abstract ideas of
   this, and that, and the other virtue; things that are never
   discoverable by the eye; who that considers, but must acknowledge a
   loveliness in them? And how many in fact are brought into a real and
   hearty love with such fair and orderly contextures of truth, when they
   see things do well cohere and hang together? The ideas of justice,
   fortitude, humility, patience, temperance; how many are there that do
   really love and admire these virtues though they only perceive the
   beauty and usefulness of them by the mind, and in their effects?

   So then it is no impossible thing that there may be that apprehension
   in the mind concerning God, upon which he shall be confessed to be
   lovely, and that be ought to be loved though he is never to be seen.
   The case is the same as to other affections, and there is a parity of
   reason between them. If it were impossible to love any thing but what
   one sees, we are proportionably incapable of fearing, hating, or
   admiring any thing but what we see. But let any one ask himself the
   question, whether he is not many times offended at the mention of
   things lie doth not see: and whether his heart is not really afraid of
   things as yet invisible; or whether he hath not been many times raised
   into an admiration of sundry things, of which he has only heard the
   report. And again, I add in the next place,

   [4.] That many persons have lived in this world in bodies of flesh as
   we do, exercising a holy love to God, notwithstanding they never saw
   him. Therefore it is no impossible thing; for Quod fieri potuit,
   potest, what has been, maybe: according to the old maxim. Do we think
   that there have been no lovers of God in the world, who have lived in
   bodies and depended on sense as we do? God knows there have been but
   few, in any time or age of the world; yet have there not been some who
   have loved him, and have not loved their lives unto the death for his
   sake? What professions of love, what raptures of phrase and expression
   do we find many times in Scripture from those whose hearts were full
   of, and overflowed with love? When the fire burned within, it could not
   be withheld from flaming out. "I will love thee, O Lord my strength,"
   says David; and again, "I love the Lord," that is from my very bowels,
   "because he hath heard my voice and my supplications." [38] How full
   are the psalms of these expressions! and we must suppose the Psalmist
   to be full of an answerable sense. "As the hart panteth for the water
   brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God! My soul fainteth for God,
   for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God? [39] How
   amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts? [40] One thing have I
   desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the
   house of the Lord all the days of my life, to be hold the beauty of the
   Lord, and to enquire in his temple. [41] For whom have I in heaven but
   thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee." [42]

   Such expressions as these verbal ones, and some significantly real
   actions and sufferings on the account of love to God, will not suffer
   us to doubt but that there have been true lovers of God, whatever there
   are in our days. And it is to be hoped, that there is some even now.
   However it is to be feared, that there are persons in the world who are
   heartily grieved, and vexed at the very heart, that there should be
   such expressions as these now mentioned, in those writings which they
   think it convenient to acknowledge as divine. For if they did not think
   thus, how loudly and clamourously would David and those who speak such
   words, have been cried out upon; and perhaps be charged with being
   fanatics and enthusiasts, as much as any in our days!

   And that an unseen God should be loved, and an unseen Christ, who is
   also out of sight, is spoken of in Scripture not only as the true
   character, but the high glory of Christian believers. "Whom having not
   seen," says St. Peter, "ye love; in whom though now ye see him not, yet
   believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory." [43]
   This is not barely affirmed, concerning these primitive Christians, but
   spoken of them as their high praise and encomium; as being a discovery
   of the refinedness, excellency, and greatness of their spirits, who
   could so far lift up themselves above sense and sensible things, as to
   place their highest and most vigorous love upon an unseen Object. That
   was glorious joy, and glorious love, placed upon what was not seen; a
   deserving Object, at least believed to be such, though not seen.

   And so it is we know that the blessed God becomes visible. "By faith
   Moses endured, as seeing him who is invisible." [44] The word of God is
   a representation of himself, and makes report of all the glorious
   excellencies belonging to him. Among the rest this is his peculiar and
   distinguishing attribute, "that he cannot lie." [45] His truth is one
   of those excellencies; therefore it is impossible that he should
   misrepresent himself, or say that he is other than he is. "For," as the
   apostle says, "what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of
   man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the
   Spirit of God." [46] He sure can best tell what an excellent and
   glorious Being he is, and as he has told us he is such a one (which it
   was impossible he should do if he were not really possessed of those
   excellencies) then there is all the reason in the world to acknowledge,
   that he ought to be loved infinitely above all. And this hath been the
   sense of many, whose practice also hath been answerable to it; who have
   been in this world, living in tabernacles of clay and earth as we do.
   Therefore it follows, that it is no impossible thing that God should be
   loved, though he be not seen. And supposing it not impossible, then

   In the next place it is easy to be proved also, that it is not unfit to
   love God, for that reason. Sundry suggestions might be used to enforce
   this, and afterwards the absurdities of this excuse might also be
   brought in view. Indeed I have had it most in my eye, to expose this
   absurd principle, that men have no need to concern themselves with
   things unseen; I would fain, I say, drive it out of the world. And if
   men would but examine it thoroughly, it would appear to them
   monstrously absurd. To do this therefore, and set it before their eyes,
   would be worth our time, and shall accordingly be done hereafter.

SERMON VI. [47]

   UPON the latter part of the text lies the main weight of the discourse
   we have in hand. "How can he love God whom he hath not seen?" In which
   it is plainly implied, that we are still perpetually bound to love God,
   notwithstanding his being invisible. And the vehemence of the apostle's
   expostulation here, implies it to be a most intolerable thing not to do
   so. And therefore we have observed,

   That not to love God is a sin most horrid and heinous, notwithstanding
   the excuse that we see him not. Here we proposed in the

   I. Place to shew the vanity and impertinence of this excuse; and then,

   II. To demonstrate the heinousness of this sin, and its horrid nature.

   In order to evince the impertinence of this excuse, there were two
   things which it was charged with; to wit, that it has nothing which a
   valid excuse should have; and if it could be admitted, it would draw
   the worst consequences after it.

   1. It is insufficient, as we have observed, to allege this as an excuse
   for not loving God, that we see him not; because it Is not for this
   reason impossible, nor unfit, that God should require this by a law.
   [48]

   (1.) It is not impossible. For the sight of our eye is not the
   immediate cause of our loving any thing, but only the medium by which
   the mind discerns the loveliness of the object. For there are other
   means besides this of sight, to possess our minds with the love of
   certain things. And since there are such in the present case, which
   lead us to the love of God, and have actually led others to it, it is
   therefore possible to be done, and is by no means an improper thing to
   be the matter of a law. We now proceed

   (2.) To shew that it is not an unreasonable law; or, that it cannot
   with any colour be pretended, that it was an unfit thing that God
   should lay a law upon men, dwelling in flesh as we do, obliging them to
   love an invisible being. We shall here first examine what can be
   pretended from God's invisibility, to make it unfit to oblige men by a
   law to love him: and then lay down some considerations to evince, that
   it is most reasonable and fit that men should, notwithstanding, be
   under this obligation.

   [1.] Let us examine what may be thought of as a pretence to the
   contrary, or alleged against the obligation of this law. Perhaps some
   may object against it after this manner: "The admitting what hath been
   proved, that it is no impossible thing that God should be loved by men
   who see him not; yet it doth not therefore follow that it is the fit
   matter of a law. Many things are possible, yet very unfit to be
   enjoined, especially those things which are unsuitable to the common
   inclination of a people. The wisdom of law-givers teacheth them to
   study the temper of their subjects, and to suit their laws to them; and
   it would be thought very unfit and improper to make laws, that should
   cross the common genius of the people; and to urge the observance of
   them. But now the dependance that we have upon sense, cannot but infer
   a disinclination to the love of such things as sight cannot reach, nor
   come within the sphere and cognizance of our senses. To apply this to
   the present case. Every man, by consulting himself, may find a
   disinclination in his own heart to the exercise of love to God. "And
   what!" hereupon may the sensualist say, "must I be obliged to a
   perpetual war with myself? to run counter to all my most natural
   inclinations? to neglect the things which my own eyes tell me are
   lovely; and labour to love an invisible being, of whom I have none but
   cloudy thoughts, a very faint and shadowy idea? Who can imagine that I
   should be put into this sensible world, with such senses suitable
   thereunto, as I find about me; and that it must be expected from me
   that I must even renounce my senses, run counter to my very eyes,
   abandon the things which so presently court my love, and tell me so
   feelingly that they are delightful? In short, that I must retire from
   substantial good which I know, to seek after what appears to me as a
   dark shadow? and which whether there be any thing substantial in it, I
   know not?" Thus may the man devoted to sense pretend on such grounds,
   that God is not to be loved by such as we who dwell in bodies of flesh,
   and have so much dependence upon the things of sense. Well! let us
   examine this pretence a little, and see whether there is any thine in
   it to make the duty of loving God unfit to be imposed upon us in this
   our present state. And there are several things here to be considered
   in reference to this matter. As,

   First. If we would have this inclination to signify any thing with
   relation to the fitness or unfitness of a law to be imposed upon us, we
   ought surely to examine whether that inclination be good or bad, and so
   judge. But can there be a worse inclination in any creature than to
   disaffect the Author and Original of its own being? And by how much the
   stronger the inclination is to evil, by so much the greater is the
   wickedness likely to prove. For do not we think every one more wicked
   as he is the more wickedly inclined, especially when he indulges his
   wicked inclinations? Doth not his evil inclination, I say, when
   indulged, add to, and not detract from his wickedness? If one be found
   to have killed another, the great thing inquired into, is the
   inclination indulged, the intention; whether or no it was through
   malice propense. If he did the thing without the design of ill to the
   party, without inclination or propensity to such an action, he is
   looked upon as innocent. An unintended fact is not punishable as a
   crime. Therefore to allege inclination in this case, is but to excuse
   one wickedness by another.

   Secondly. Consider what would become of this world, if men were to be
   ruled only by their own inclination, or if that were to be the only
   rule by which all laws relating to them were to be measured. What a
   dreadful state would you be in, if it were permitted to any man to rob,
   murder, rifle away your goods and destroy your lives, only because he
   is inclined to it? if every one might take from you what he would, and
   do any imaginable mischief to you or yours, merely because he hath a
   mind to it!

   And whereas the disaffection to God is very common, and rooted and
   confirmed in men by their being disused to converse with things above
   the reach of their senses (which might tend to invite their hearts and
   attract their affections) how horrid a thing were it if such a vicious
   custom were to obtain the force of a law! or, if men were to be allowed
   to do so and so wickedly, only because they have been wont so to do! if
   the oftener the swearer, the drunkard, the fornicator and the murderer,
   have indulged their respective vices, the more lawful it should be for
   them to continue such practices! if men, in a word, should be so far a
   law to themselves, as to be permitted to do whatsoever they have been
   used to do! or, as Seneca says, if a reasonable creature should go like
   a sheep, not the way he ought, but that which he has been used to;
   what, I say, can be more unreasonable and unfit than this?

   Thirdly. It must be considered, that though it is the wisdom of a ruler
   to regard the inclinations of a people in making laws, yet sure there
   must be a distinction made between things indifferent and things
   necessary. But is there any thing of higher and more absolute necessity
   than the love of God, though we see him not? Doth not our experience
   tell us, that we stand in need of somewhat that we do not see, in order
   to the continuance of our being? much more in order to our happiness.
   If you had nothing but what you see to maintain life, do you think it
   were possible for you to live another moment? I would appeal to the
   considerate reason of any man, whether he were not to be thought a
   madman that should say, "I will be alive the next hour?" Man! there is
   somewhat in visible and unseen that is the continual Sustainer of thy
   life; "in whom we all live, and move, and have our being." Acts xvii.
   28. Our own experience must convince us of this, that there is an
   invisible Being which hath dominion over our lives, otherwise every man
   could measure his own time. But do not we find men die before they are
   willing, and when they would fain live longer? Why, it is somewhat
   unseen that imposes this necessity upon them, "Here thou must expire!"
   No man hath power over the spirit to retain it, neither hath he power
   in the day of death. Eccles. viii. 8.

   And again, is it at all necessary to us to be happy? Our own experience
   tells us that we are not as yet happy and satisfied. And common
   experience tells all the world, that all the things they can see and
   set their eyes upon, can never make them happy in this world. And if we
   expect to be happy in another, when will our eyes lead us to heaven?
   when will sense, inclination, and following the customs of this world
   bring us to blessedness? It were a dreadful thing, if in a matter of so
   absolute necessity, custom or inclination were to be the measure of the
   law which must govern us. And again,

   Fourthly. I add in the next place, that it is true indeed that rulers
   do consider the tempers and inclinations of a people under their
   legislature. And there is good reason they should do so, and not impose
   unnecessarily upon the people, things of mere indifferency, and so run
   the hazard of urging them into tumults about matters of very little
   consequence. But sure there is no such need or reason that the great
   Author and Lord of all things should so much concern himself what the
   inclinations of those are whom he is to govern. If they dislike his
   laws, and have an inclination to tumultuate or rebel against him let
   their dislike and inclination be as strong as it will, He that sitteth
   in the heavens will laugh, and have them in derision; when they say,
   Let us break his bands asunder, and cast away his cords from us. Psalm
   ii. 3, 4.

   Fifthly. There is a very great difference in the consideration of laws
   already made, and of laws to be made. This law was made for man when he
   was no way disinclined to the love of God. It is a law as ancient as
   his being. He had it as soon as he had the nature of man. It is
   therefore a, part of the law of nature, and one of the most deeply
   fundamental things in that law; for it is made the summary, and wraps
   up all laws whatsoever in itself; for all is fulfilled in love. And
   what! was it reasonable or fit that this law, so suitable at first to
   the nature of man, should be then repealed, when he thought fit to
   break and violate it? That were a strange way of superseding the
   obligation of a law, that as soon as it is transgressed, it should
   oblige no longer! Then may any subject be a sovereign; since there
   would be no need of any thing more to make a law cease to oblige him,
   than for him to disobey it.

   Sixthly. Consider that our not seeing God is so far from having a
   necessary tendency to preclude the love of him, that if things were
   with men as. they should be, and as they have been with some in the
   world, it would very much promote our loving him. For though we cannot
   see him, yet we see many things that are great arguments, and should be
   powerful inducements to us to love him. It is true we do not see God
   with our bodily eyes, but we see the effects of his wisdom, his
   goodness, his mercy and patience every where; and of his mighty power
   over all, especially over those who are for God and lovers of him.

   If we take a view, as we can do with these eyes, of the beautiful and
   glorious works of his creation, we continually be hold in the visible
   things that are made, the invisible power and Godhead, (Rom. i. 20.)
   which we are called upon to adore and love. And in the works of his
   providence and the ways of his dispensations towards men great
   arguments of love do daily occur. And into what raptures of affection
   do we find holy souls transported even by the help of their own eyes!
   the things seen, representing to them the great unseen Object of love.
   In what an extasy do we find David, upon the view of the beauty and
   glory of this creation! "How excellent is thy name in all the earth, O
   Lord our Lord, who hast set thy glory above the heavens!" What put him
   into this rapture? The sight of his own eyes. He beheld "the heavens
   the work of God's hands, the moon and stars which he had ordained;" and
   therefore as he begins, so he ends the psalm in a transport; "How
   excellent is thy name in all the earth!" Psalm viii. And thus our own
   eyes may serve to be our instructors, and prompt us to the love of him
   the great Author and Original of all that glory, which we find every
   where diffused in this world.

   The viewing God also in the ways of his providence, how hath it excited
   the love of holy men sometimes! When Moses and the children of Israel
   had seen that marvellous work of the sea divided, themselves conducted
   and brought safe through it, the waters made a wall on the right hand
   and on the left, and their enemies dead on the sea-shore, how did this
   set love on work in them! how is the blessed God adored and admired
   upon the account of what their eyes had seen of him! "Who, say they, is
   a God like unto thee? Who is like to thee among the gods, glorious in
   holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?" Exod. xv. 11. And after
   the people of God had seen that great salvation wrought that we find
   recorded in the fourth chapter of Judges, what a mighty raisedness of
   heart do we find in the next chapter, all shut up in this. "So let all
   thine enemies perish, O Lord, but let them that love him be as the sun
   when he goeth forth in his might." Judges v. 31. Here was love set on
   work and raised to the height, so as even to pour out blessings upon
   all the lovers of God. What a phrase ofbenediction is that, "Let all
   that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might!" which
   proceeded from the view of his excellent greatness.

   So that this pretence, that God is not seen, doth not make it
   unreasonable or unfit that the duty of love to him should be imposed
   upon men by his law. They are not for this reason necessarily
   disinclined to love him, and therefore this excuse for not loving him
   is neither reasonable nor fit, nor can exempt men from the obligation,
   as the objection supposes. Let us then see,

   [2.] What can be alleged to prove, that the love of God is most fit and
   reasonable to be the matter of a standing and in dispensable law. And
   to this purpose, in order to shew how reasonable this is, we shall only
   note in general, that if any should object against the fitness of
   loving God on this ground, because he is not seen, and affirm that for
   this reason men should not be required to love him; what they have to
   say in this case, if it signifies any thing to the purpose, must be as
   strong an objection in all cases of like consideration, and must at
   last come to this; that it is unreasonable and unfit that men should be
   affected with any thing they cannot see. But the falshood hereof, and
   the reasonableness of this injunction upon men may be gathered from
   this fourfold consideration; to wit, that we may be as sure of the
   objects of the mind, as we can be of the objects of our sight; that
   those of the former sort are generally more excellent; that we are
   concerned in them, as much at least, and in many of them infinitely
   more, than in the others; and finally, that what can only be the object
   of the mind may be more intimately present with us, than those things
   which are the objects of sense. And if we can make out all these, which
   I hope we may, then it must be concluded that God is so much the more
   to be loved, yea infinitely more than any thing our eye can see or make
   a discovery of.

   First. We may be as sure of the real existence of the objects of our
   mind, as we can be of any objects of our sight; or in other words, we
   may be as certain of the existence of in visible beings, as of visible
   ones. We may frame a notion of their existence with as much assurance;
   and form certain conclusions concerning their nature, though they are
   invisible to the bodily eye. We may especially be most sure of the
   existence of God, though we cannot see him; more indeed than we can be
   generally of the existence of visible things.

   Sometimes the objects of our mind and sight meet in one, there is
   somewhat visible and somewhat invisible. As for instance, in actions
   that are capable of moral consideration, there is the action itself,
   and there is also the rectitude or irrectitude of that action. Now here
   is at once an object of my sight and of my mind; and I may be as
   certain of the one, as of the other, in many instances. As, suppose I
   see one strike, wound, or kill an innocent person; or, suppose I see
   one affront a magistrate," injuriously or barbarously; here I have the
   object of my eye and mind at once. That the action was done I am
   certain, for I saw the stroke; and I am no less sure of the affront,
   though that be an object of the mind. As soon as I see such an action
   done, do not I apprehend it to be ill done? Is not the thing which my
   mind apprehends, as real as that which my eyes see? Am I not as sure
   that it was ill done, as that the action was done at all? though the
   one falls under my eye, and the other only under the cognizance of the
   mind.

   Again, if we look no further than ourselves, our own frame and
   composition, we may be as certain of the existence of what we see not,
   as of what we do see. We have a body. We are sure we have a body, for
   we can see it. It is many ways the object of our senses, or the
   external organs that are planted there. But we cannot see our minds,
   yet I hope we are nevertheless sure that we have minds. We are as
   certain that we have somewhat about us that can think, can understand,
   as we are that we may be seen and felt. I go not about to determine now
   what it is that thinks whether material or not, mortal or not; but
   every man that will consider, is as sure that he has a mind which he
   cannot see, as that he has a body which he can see.

   To bring this matter home to our present purpose concerning the supreme
   invisible Being, the blessed God. It is most apparent that we may be as
   certain of his existence as of any thing; and unspeakably more certain
   of his constant existence, than we can be of any being whatsoever.
   There is no man that will use his understanding, but must allow this.
   For, suppose an object of sight before me, I am certain that it doth
   exist; for I see it. Now the following conclusion may be as certain to
   any one that considers, to wit, something is, therefore something hath
   ever been. I will appeal to any understanding man, whether this be not
   as certain as the other. For if we should suppose a time when nothing
   ever was, when nothing existed, any man's understanding must tell him,
   it was impossible that any thing should ever have been, Suppose a
   season when nothing was, and then was it possible any thing of itself
   should arise out of that nothing, when there was nothing at all
   conceivable? that a thing should be before it was, and do something
   when it was nothing? Therefore it is hence most necessarily consequent,
   that there must needs be some original, eternal Being, subsisting of
   itself, that was always and never began to be; and therefore was
   necessarily, and so can never cease to be. [49]

   Let this be but weighed, and let any sober understanding judge, whether
   this conclusion be not as certain as the former. That is, compare these
   two conclusions together, I see something, therefore something is; and
   this also, something is, therefore something hath ever been, some
   original Being that always was of itself, and could not but be. A man,
   I say, feels as great a certainty in his own mind concerning this, as
   concerning the other. He must renounce his understanding as much in one
   case, as his eyes in the other, if he will not grant this to be
   certain, that as some beings now exist, there has been always an
   original, self-existing Being.

   And then supposing the existence of the thing already, I may form as
   certain conclusions concerning the attributes of what I cannot see, as
   of that which I can see. To apply this also to the invisible, eternal
   Being: look to any visible thing, and your eyes can tell what are its
   visible accidents. I look upon the wall, and see it is white. I know it
   is so, because I see it is so. Cannot I as certainly conclude
   concerning this original, eternal Being, that he is wise, holy, just
   and powerful? I know that there is such a thing as wisdom, and justice,
   goodness, and power in the world. I know that these things are not
   nothing, and that they did not come out of nothing; therefore they must
   needs originally belong to the original Being. Is not this as certain,
   and as plain, as any visible accident of any thing is to a man's eye?
   Must not these attributes necessarily first be in God, as in their
   original Seat and proper Subject? yea, a great deal more certainly,
   than any kind of quality we can suppose to be lovely in the creature
   can agree to it: because as for the original Being, that existed of
   itself; and therefore is necessarily and by consequence eternally, and
   invariably whatever it is. Therefore since these perfections are
   originally in God himself, or derivations from him, what should
   rationally keep a man in suspense, when by the intervention of his mind
   he sees such an invisible object, but that he should fall in love with
   that, as well as with any visible object, that commends itself as
   lovely to the sight. And I should next add,

   Secondly, That invisible excellency is infinitely greater than any
   visible excellency can be. As there is a reality in unseen things, and
   especially in this invisible Object, as much as in any thing we see
   with our eyes; so there is generally a higher excellency in invisible
   objects, than in those that are visible, and infinitely more in this
   than in other invisible objects. But this and the other considerations
   I cannot reach to now.

   [48] Here we shewed that if any thing be brought in excuse for not
   obeying the law, and the exception is not against the authority of the
   law-giver, but to the matter of the law, that which is alleged as a
   valid excuse, must he able to evince one of these two things: either
   that the thing enjoined by this law, is impossible to them on whom it
   is enjoined; or that at least though possible, yet it is unfit, and
   therefore unreasonable to be imposed. Neither of which will be
   admitted. It is indeed impossible to men considered under the reigning
   power of sin, and while they remain so. It is so only by a compound
   impossibility; as there is a compound necessity, by which a thing is
   said necessarily to be, while it is. But to love God though we see him
   not, is not a simple impossibility; for then it were impossible, that
   he should he loved by any one at all.

   [49] This argument is urged at large, with great force and strength in
   the Author's admirable Treatise, entitled the Living Temple. Part 1,
   Chap. 2.

SERMON VII. [50]

   THE SECOND head of discourse which we are still upon Is this, That men
   are not released from the obligation to love God though he be
   invisible; and that it is not only an evil, but a most horrid and
   intolerable one too, not to love him, notwithstanding the excuse that
   we cannot see him. And this, as we observed, you have from the plain
   words of the text; inasmuch as all the force of the apostle's reasoning
   depends upon it. For he is endeavouring to evince how unreasonable it
   is we should not love one another, because upon this would ensue that
   infernal thing our not loving God; rather than admit which, it is
   supposed that men would admit any thing. For the prosecution of this
   truth we proposed to evince, in the first place, that this is a very
   vain excuse: [51] and have already shewn from many considerations, that
   it is not impossible to love God in these bodies of flesh, wherein we
   have such a dependence on the senses; neither is it unreasonable, or
   unfit that it should be enjoined as a duty. Against the contrary
   principle we have designed to insist on sundry considerations, and have
   observed already in the

   First place, that we may be as sure of the existence of many invisible
   beings, especially of God, as we are of any that are visible. This we
   have shewn, and also that it is as easy to form conclusions respecting
   the nature of the former, as it is of the latter. Both these we
   laboured to evince from several instances: and concluded with observing
   to this effect, that since all perfections are originally in God, which
   we may discern by the intervention of the understanding, therefore it
   is as reasonable to love him, as any visible object how lovely soever;
   and more so indeed, because he is eternally and invariably the same.
   For, to add something further on this head,

   I see and converse often with such or such a person, who because of
   certain amiable qualities that I discern in him, hath attracted and
   drawn my love: but I am never sure those qualities will remain in him
   always. I know not whether they be of that kind, yea or no, that they
   will remain. But I most certainly know, that he will not always remain
   with me the conversable object of my love. And therefore if sense, if
   the sight of what is lovely in him be the only ground of my love to
   him, I could never have loved him longer than my eye could see him. For
   as soon as he is gone out of my sight, I know not but he is gone out of
   being, out of the world, and so the object of my love may be quite
   lost. But I know that the eternal Being doth exist necessarily, and
   always. It is impossible that God should ever not exist, or ever be
   other than he was: and therefore if loveliness and amiableness were
   found there at any time, it is to be found there at all times; without
   variableness and shadow of change, yesterday, and to-day the same, and
   for ever.

   And now upon all this, since it is very plain and evident, that we may
   be as certain concerning what we see not, as concerning what we do see;
   as sure of the existence of invisible, as of visible being; and more
   especially about the nature and existence, (as far as concerns us) of
   the blessed invisible God; it is plain that there our love ought to
   have its exercise, as much as any where else, supposing such
   excellencies to be found in the invisible things, as may equally
   recommend the object to our love. Therefore we add,

   Secondly: That, invisible things are really of far higher excellency,
   than those which are visible. As the things that we cannot see have as
   certain a reality as those that we can see; so, I say, they are of
   higher excellency: and this blessed invisible Object infinitely more
   excellent, as we must acknowledge, while we acknowledge him to be God.
   If we speak of such things as lie within the compass of our being, how
   plain is the case and how evident the inference! Sure the invisible
   world must needs be of incomparably greater excellency and glory, than
   the visible world. And if you reduce all kinds of being in the whole
   universe to these two ranks and orders, visible and invisible;
   certainly the latter must be unspeakably more excellent.

   We who are for our parts set in the confines of both worlds, visible
   and invisible; we in whose very nature both meet, unite, and touch one
   another, and are as it were comparted together; we who are of a nature
   partly visible, partly invisible, partly flesh and partly spirit, or as
   the language of Plato's school was, Nous chous, mind and dust united
   into one compound; surely we should not be partial in our judgment of
   this case. Who should be impartial if we are not, who are set as a
   middle sort of creatures between the two worlds, and so are capable of
   looking into, and surveying the one and the other?

   And if we contemplate both, even in ourselves, methinks it should be no
   difficult thing with us to determine which is of greater excellency,
   this bulk of flesh, or this spirit which in habits it, and keeps it
   from being a dead lump, an useless, rot ten, putrid carcass. Yea, if we
   should suppose the body of a man to be animated by some inferior vital
   principle to that of a reasonable spirit, yet this would be the more
   excellent part. It is true, we should then have before our eyes a
   certain sort of human brute, of which kind there are but too many in
   our age, at least that live and carry it as such. We should in short,
   to speak plainly, have somewhat before our eyes that wore the mere
   shape of a man, and could hear, and see, and smell, and taste, and move
   to and fro this way or that, and must ere long, after a few turns are
   fetched about, turn to dust, to rottenness, and corruption. But suppose
   we a spirit separately, such as is wont to animate a human body: here
   we have to contemplate something that can think, reason, and
   understand; that can form abstract notions of things, or compare one
   thing with another; something that can reflect upon itself, which our
   eye cannot do; that can control and correct the errors of sense; that
   can run through the vast compass of known things; is capable of solving
   problems and difficult questions; of laying down principles and maxims
   of truth, after having weighed and found them firm, so as that they may
   pass current: for such there are which pass unquestionably every where
   for undoubted principles. In a word, we have here a kind of being to
   contemplate, that is capable of taking up what lies within the compass
   of philosophy, policy, and the whole human orb of learning; of being
   instructed in all the great mysteries of mechanical skill of every
   kind; and in short, that can turn itself every way; and is of a nature
   unperishable and immortal, not liable to, nor capable of corruption,
   but must last for ever and always endure. Who now would make any
   difficulty of owning, that this is a far more excellent thing than the
   other? this spirit, than that shape of a man which merely lives? But
   yet even this more excellent creature which we have been supposing, is
   somewhat diminished, and falls beneath a brighter order of beings, by
   its being proportioned to a human body. And upon this account man is
   said to be a little lower than the angels, [52] at least this is one
   account that may be given of this passage; for it is a diminution of
   the spirit of a man, that it is proportioned to its habitation, the
   body. But then consider those purely intellectual creatures, of whom we
   know not how to form a notion, which shall be more expressive than to
   call them Intelligences; inasmuch as they are, as far as we can
   apprehend them, beings of knowledge and light, and also of goodness and
   love proportioned to that light of theirs; what can match the
   excellency of such creatures as these, among the whole sphere of
   visible beings?

   But let us further consider how vastly numerous that order of creatures
   is, as we may very well suppose, and partly collect from intimations of
   Scripture, where they are said to be innumerable. "The innumerable
   company of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect." [53] How
   much of glory and excellency must then be in the invisible world,
   beyond what we can possibly conceive of in this lower visible region!
   If we do but bethink ourselves and consider what a mere punctilio, a
   little point, this earth is in which we dwell, in comparison of that
   vast expanse that doth surround and encompass it about; how
   unspeakably, how inconceivably more numerous must we suppose the
   inhabitants to be, that replenish those vast superior regions quite out
   of sight, than those which inhabit and replenish this point of earth?
   How vast, I say, must we suppose the invisible world to be, if we
   consider the number of its inhabitants who are parts of God's creation,
   whom we have reason to think do competently replenish all those vast
   regions that are, when our eye has gone as far as it can, far more
   exceeding the reach of our thoughts. What limits can we set to the
   creation of God in our most enlarged thoughts? Finite we must suppose
   it to be, but alas, we are never capable of measuring the bounds! And
   we have reason to believe it is every where replenished with such
   glorious invisible creatures as we speak of, in comparison of whom all
   the inhabitants of the earth, that ever where or shall be, are but an
   inconsiderable handful. Are we not then to think that the invisible
   world is far more excellent than that which is visible?

   But then if we ascend to the great Author of all things, the blessed
   invisible Object that we are concerned to speak about, that vast
   profound abyss of all excellencies, perfection, and glory, how much
   more must we conclude there is of excellency in that sort of being in
   general which is invisible, than in that which is visible! If we
   consider him inhabiting his own eternity, if we consider his immensity
   who was before all time, whom "heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot
   contain," [54] every where existing, and never not existing; in whom
   there is an infinite fulness, a rich fountain of being, life, wisdom,
   power, goodness and holiness, and whatsoever we can conceive under the
   notion of excellency and perfection: to think of such a Being that was
   every where before all time was, and continuing to be the same when
   time shall be no more, where no worlds are, and where never any shall
   be, replenishing all the space that we can imagine, and that we cannot
   imagine, all, every where, and eternally full of being, life and glory!
   what an object have we now to contemplate, and think of in the
   invisible order of beings! And what? would we confine all excellency as
   well as reality to this little, minute, inconsiderable earth! the
   things that sense can reach unto! As if our senses were to be the
   measure of all excellency, perfection and reality, and it was the same
   thing for any thing to be nothing, or at least worth nothing, as to be
   out of our sight.

   How unreasonable were such an imagination as this! And indeed well
   might we be ashamed, and count it a reflection upon our profession of
   the Christian name, that we may so of ten read Pagans discoursing in
   transports of the Intellectual Pulchritude, of the beauty and
   excellency of mental and invisible things; while our hearts, in the
   mean time, are taken with nothing but what our eyes can reach to see,
   or our senses judge of. With what raptures do some of them speak of the
   first pulchritude, and the self-pulchritude, or that which is lovely of
   itself. Plato in particular calls him, "The Being that is with itself,
   always agreeing to itself always existing uniformly, never varying from
   itself, and lasting always." Thus he speaks of the first ORIGINAL
   BEAUTY, meaning the great Object that we now speak of, to wit, the
   invisible God. But what a degeneracy is it to measure the objects of
   our love by the sight of the eye! whereas there is nothing fair or
   good, as philosophers speak, but what hath its derivation from the
   first pulchritude; or as it hath a kind of precarious beauty and
   comeliness derived to it from him, who is the first and original
   Beauty. If then we seriously bethink ourselves of this, we cannot but
   acknowledge that the prime Object of our lovelies among the invisible
   things. If we will but use our thoughts, we must say thus: this, I say,
   must be the conclusion, if we will not profess brutality, and renounce
   our humanity; that is, deny that we are human and reasonable creatures.

   But because here it may possibly be said, "That admitting there be so
   great excellency and glory in the invisible sort of beings, yet we are
   to love where we are concerned; we are to place our love among things
   with which we have to do, and upon which we have dependence; but how
   little can we have to do with things invisible, and out of our sight?"
   Therefore I add,

   Thirdly: We are a great deal more concerned about invisible, than
   visible things. They are of much more importance to us, as well as of
   greater excellency considered in themselves. It will certainly be found
   one day, that faith, holiness, humility, meekness, mortifiedness to
   this world, a mastery over insolent and brutish passions, tranquillity,
   peace, and composure of spirit, those great ornaments of the hidden man
   of the heart, are of unspeakably more concernment, than all the things
   of the visible world besides. These are of greater importance to our
   present comfort, and to our future and eternal well-being, than
   whatsoever our senses can bring to our notice. But the invisible God is
   so most of all, who is infinitely beyond and above all.

   And what! will any pretend, that they have no concern with God, because
   they cannot see him? no concern with him, "in whom we live, and move,
   and have our being, and in whose hand our breath is," without whom we
   cannot move a hand or lift a foot, or think a thought, or live a
   moment? Have we no concern with him? none in this present state? Or are
   we the less concerned with God, because we see him not? May we not be
   convinced, if we will allow ourselves to think, that it is some what
   invisible, which our life and being depend upon? For we know ourselves
   to be depending beings. We do know and feel, yea our own thoughts and
   hearts must instruct us in this, that we are not self-subsistent. We
   have not in our own hands the measure of our time, nor the command of
   our own concernments. We find ourselves controled and over-ruled in
   many things every day. There are many thousands of things that we would
   have otherwise, if we could tell how. There is something invisible to
   which we owe our breath, and that hath dominion over us, whether we
   mind it or not. And have we no concern with that Being, which hath such
   immediate power over our lives, and all our comforts, in this present
   state and world? But what talk we of measuring our concernments by this
   present state? Have not our own souls a secret consciousness in them,
   that they are made for eternity? for a world where they are to be
   perpetual inhabitants, after a little short time is over? And have we
   not therefore now in this life, most to do with invisible things,
   especially with the great invisible Lord, both of the visible and
   invisible creation?

   We should soon know ourselves to be most concerned with what is
   invisible, and most of all with God, if we would but understand the
   state of our case. We know ourselves to be creatures. We did not come
   into this world of our own choice, or by our own contrivance. We made
   not ourselves, neither was it the object of our choice, whether we
   would be of this or that rank or order of creatures; but were put into
   that rank of beings wherein we are, by a superior and higher hand. Yea
   considering what sort of being it is we have, and what a nature the
   great Author and Parent of all nature hath furnished us with, it is
   easy for us by a little reflection to come to this knowledge, that we
   are not what he made us; that we are fallen creatures as well as
   reasonable ones; that we have incurred the displeasure of him that made
   us; that we are absolutely at his mercy; that there is such a darkness
   and blindness upon our minds and understandings, and such a stupidity
   and death possessing our very souls, that can never be supposed to have
   been in the first formation of such a creature by the hands of God.
   Lastly, we may find, that we are become impure and corrupt; that there
   are per verse sinful inclinations and affections, which we ourselves
   can-? not but disapprove of, and disallow upon reflection: and that
   hereby we are under a very egregious guilt, and so subject to wrath and
   eternal punishment. If we would but allow ourselves to consider this as
   our state, we should soon know that we have more to do with the
   invisible God, than with all the world of visible things. Yea further,
   how amiable would he appear in our eyes, if we did but understand
   ourselves! if we would but take notice what dark, blind creatures we
   are, how would it recommend him to us, who is represented as the light
   of our eyes, and the life of our hearts! In a word, if we would but
   consider what deformed creatures we are, how impure, and alluding to
   the expression in Job, [55] so plunged in the ditch, that our own
   clothes might abhor us, Oh how delectable would the thoughts of him be!
   how lovely would he be in our eyes that brings such overtures of
   purification to us! I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall
   be clean from all your filthiness; and from all your idols will I
   cleanse you. [56] And he that offers this, will certainly effect it in
   all those, who are designed for a blessed commerce with him for ever,
   in order to make them perfect in his own comeliness.

   Then again, if we consider how liable we are to his wrath, how fast
   bound with the cords of our own guilt, how amiable would that notion
   and name of God be to us, which was proclaimed to Moses, "The Lord, the
   Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in
   goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity,
   transgression, and sin." [57] But we measure things by the sight of our
   own eye, because we will not allow ourselves to take any cognizance of
   the true state of our own case. Whereas if we did but consider the
   matter, and give ourselves leave to think and inquire, we should know
   there are things which concern us unspeakably more, that are out of
   sight, than what come under our view day by day; and that especially we
   are most concerned with him who is least in our sight, and most remote
   from the view of our external eye. And then add to all this,

   Fourthly: That invisible things are a great deal more capable of being
   intimate to us, or we may be infinitely more conversant with them, than
   it is possible for us to be with things that are seen. We love a friend
   whom we have often seen; and it may be, the oftener we have seen him
   the more we love him. But we cannot be with this friend always. The
   dearest friends must part. We cannot have him perpetually in our bosom
   to converse with in a friendly manner. A great many things must concur
   to the entertainment of our friends with delight, and to converse with
   them with pleasure. For instance, they must be in a pleasant humour,
   and at leisure for converse. We many times wait for visits, and they
   are not given; or we design them, but are disappointed. Messengers may
   be sent to this or that place, one after another; and yet two friends,
   that would converse, cannot be brought together. Besides, when we are
   conversing with such lower objects of our love, we must make use of
   speech, and are fain to employ words, those necessary but imperfect
   instruments, or media of conversation. But we cannot convey by words
   our full and clear apprehensions to others, so as to let them know all
   that we would have them know. And most of the controversies in the
   world, about matters of opinion in religion, do arise from hence, that
   men cannot be brought to understand one another. I cannot tell how to
   make another master of my thoughts, but one way or other the notion
   will be misrepresented, and so not lie so distinctly clear in another's
   mind, as it doth in his that would propagate it. But if we could this
   way infuse into them a full and clear knowledge of what we ourselves do
   intend, yet we cannot thereby infuse a living sense, nor convey the
   affections that are in our own bosoms to another by words.

   But how intimately conversant may we be with the invisible God, and
   that blessed Spirit that understands not only our words, but our sighs
   and groans, and the living sense thereof that is unutterable. God can
   also be conversant with us whithersoever we go, wheresoever we are, so
   that as soon as we are minded to retire, we find him with us. As soon
   as we retire into ourselves with a design to converse inwardly with the
   living God, he is immediately present with us, and it is as easy to
   converse with him as with our own thoughts. As soon as we think, so
   soon are we with God, and as soon is he with us. In the twinkling of an
   eye we find him. We look unto him and are lightened. Thus with a cast
   of the eye the soul is filled; it finds itself replenished with a
   divine and vital light, that diffuseth the sweetest and most pleasant
   influences and savours through the soul.

   Surely then, what is invisible, and most of all the blessed God, is
   most fit for our converse: an omnipresent God, who is every where
   present with us in the very first instant: so that there are no bodies,
   or other circumscribing circumstances to withhold and divert that
   commerce between him and us; but he is with us in our walking in the
   way, in our sitting down in our houses, in our lying down in our beds,
   in any wilderness, in any den or desert. Certainly it can be no way
   unfit, that he should be chosen for our converse, and for the great
   Object of our love, though we cannot see him. Our not being able to see
   him detracts nothing from the reasonableness of placing our love there,
   upon all these accounts. Therefore the pretence for our not loving God
   because he is invisible, is altogether in sufficient, and carries
   nothing in it that a valid excuse should have to make it so. I should
   now proceed to shew the intolerable absurdities of not loving God
   because he is invisible; but the time doth not give me leave to speak
   to them.

SERMON VIII. [58]

   HAVING in the three last discourses shewn the invalidity of the excuse
   for not loving God, drawn from his invisibility, we now proceed in the

   2. Place, to evince more fully the obligation we are under to this
   duty, and to shew the intolerable absurdity of this excuse, that is, of
   pleading that we do not love God, only because we cannot see him. [59]
   For

   (1.) It would infer, that we are to be affected or moved with no
   invisible thing whatsoever; or that nothing but what can strike our
   senses, ought to touch our hearts. For if this be a good reason in the
   present case, we do not love God because we cannot see him, wheresoever
   the case is alike, the reason will be so too; and so we are to be moved
   by nothing at all, but what is to be seen. No threatening danger then
   is to be feared or provided against, and no distant good to be cared
   for; and so our greatest concernments that should urge us more than all
   others, must be quite thrown aside. Our business for eternity and
   another world, the apprehensions of which, men cannot quite abolish out
   of their minds, must all stand still; and we live at such a rate that
   no man will be able to give a tolerable account what he liveth for, or
   what his business in this world is. For it is altogether inconceivable
   for what purpose such a creature as man is, should be here in this
   world, furnished with so much higher and nobler faculties than the
   brute beasts, and yet to do no other business but what they might do as
   well as we.

   (2.) It would hence be consequent, that the blessed God would be
   everlastingly excluded our love, or that he could never be loved by his
   reasonable intelligent creature, for an eternal reason; because he can
   never be seen, as we see our brother with eyes of flesh. None of us in
   this sense can ever behold God; and if this reason be conclusive, to
   all eternity he must be excluded our love. And so it may be affirmed
   even of his reasonable creatures, "None do love him, nor ever shall."
   And again,

   (3.) According to this way of reasoning, God would lose his interest in
   our love by the excellency of his nature. And how monstrously absurd is
   it, that by how much the more excellent an object is, so much the less
   it should be loved! For it is owing to the excellency of his nature and
   being, that God cannot be seen. And is it not a horrid consequence,
   that be cause he is so excellent as he is, therefore he is not to be
   loved? Nothing is more manifest, than that by how much the more
   excellent any thing is, so much the more it is remote from our sight.
   And shall this be admitted as a principle, that by how much the more
   excellent any thing is, the less it shall be loved? Shall God lose his
   interest in our love, merely because he is so excellent and perfect as
   he is? or shall he for this reason be less loved than visible objects
   are? Again,

   (4.) All commerce would hereupon cease, or rather never be, between the
   blessed God and his intelligent creature, at least all intellectual
   commerce suitable to such a creature. For if this were a good reason,
   He is not to be seen, therefore he is not to be loved, it would also
   follow, that he is not to be trusted, feared or obeyed. All which would
   infer, that God hath made an intelligent being with whom he can
   converse no way suitable to its nature, than which nothing can be
   thought more absurd. Further,

   (5.) All differences of moral good and evil, in such a case, would be
   quite taken away, or all apprehensions of them, from among men. For the
   rectitude or irrectitude of actions is not to be judged of, nor
   discerned by the sight of our eye. We cannot by this means alone, tell
   whether this or that thing be right or wrong. And this by consequence
   would necessarily render mankind incapable of being governed by laws;
   because the reason why a law should oblige, doth not fall under any
   man's sight. The decency and fitness of a thing the eye does not reach;
   for to discern this is the business of the mind. And so it would be
   left altogether impossible for any one to assign a reason, why it
   should be more congruous to equity and justice for one to embrace his
   friend, than to murder him; why a man should relieve the poor who
   cannot help themselves, rather than oppress them; or why a man should
   not as well, and with as great reason and equity, affront a ruler, as
   obey him and be subject to his authority? So that in short you take
   away the foundation of converse with man, at the same time you take
   away the foundation of religious converse with God and invisible
   things. By this kind of argument you not only overturn the practice of
   godliness and piety, which is a great part of that love to God we ought
   to be exercised in, but you do as effectually by the same means destroy
   all civil commerce between man and man, howsoever related; and leave no
   foundation for human society, considering the members of it in relation
   to governors or rulers, and to one another. And

   (6.) It would hence follow, that the original constitution of man's
   nature was made up of inconsistencies; nothing else but a piece of
   self-contradiction. That is, it would be necessary to do a thing, and
   yet at the same time impossible. It is necessary by the constitution of
   the human nature that man do love a known good, and therefore most of
   all the Supreme Good, which may be certainly known to be what it is,
   the absolutely best, the highest and most excellent Good, as hath been
   already shewn; and yet by this argument it would be impossible to do
   this. So absurd is this maxim or pretence, that we are not to be
   affected with invisible things, and are under no obligation to love
   God, because we see him not! In the last place,

   (7.) It would also be consequent from hence, that man must be a
   creature from the very first, made only to be miserable. For it is
   impossible that sense should ever afford him relief against internal
   evils, or ever supply him with suitable and satisfying good. How then
   can he be otherwise than miserable?

   Sense cannot afford him relief against internal evils, and no man can
   exempt himself from them, nor give himself any security that he shall
   never be invaded by such. Let there be never so great a calm, and
   according to his present apprehension let all things be never so well
   now; yet no man can assure himself, that he shall never meet with any
   inward pangs; that he shall never have cause to complain of the terrors
   of the Almighty besetting and overwhelming his soul, even ready to cut
   him off. These things have invaded as fortified breasts as any our age
   can afford; and no man knows when he is secure from them. And suppose
   they do invade a man, and conscience molested by known and often
   repeated wickedness does at length awake, and grow furious; pray where
   shall relief be had? Will the things of sense afford it? Will they ease
   such pangs, or work off agonies of this nature? In such a state of
   mind, for a man to feast himself with the objects of sense, or with
   that which pleases the eye, would be as impertinent as music to a
   broken leg, or fine clothes for the cure of a fever or an ulcerous
   body.

   Nor can sense be the inlet to a man of any suitable or satisfying good.
   Let experience witness. To those who have all sensible enjoyments to
   the full, I would say, "Are you happy? Can you pretend to want any
   thing that sense can possibly supply you with to give pleasure to your
   spirits? Have you not what you would have? and yet can you say, All is
   full and well? "Undoubtedly what was the wise man's experience, would
   be every man's that were at leisure to consider the case; The eye is
   not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. Eccles. i.
   8. Sense, let it be gratified never so much, will still live
   unsatisfied, will be always craving and never contented. And therefore
   by this supposition it must needs be consequent, that man could be
   created for no other state, than a state of misery. But how absurd were
   it to suppose, that the God of all goodness had made a creature, whom
   it should be impossible, even to himself, to make happy! (for it is
   impossible to his nature ever to make himself visible to an eye of
   flesh) and that it should be only possible to terrify and torment his
   creature, but not to satisfy it and do it good! All these things do
   plainly evince that this excuse, to wit, we cannot love God, because we
   see him not, is not only insufficient, but also most absurd. Then, say
   we, it ought not to be admitted as an excuse at all, and men are still
   under an indispensable obligation to the love of God notwithstanding.

   But here it may possibly be suggested to the thoughts of some, "Admit
   it to be a duty to love God, although we cannot see him. We acknowledge
   that his invisibility renders it not impossible nor unreasonable to
   love him; and therefore we see the excuse is insufficient, and that
   many inconveniencies and absurdities would ensue upon making it. But
   though it will be no entire excuse, yet it will sure be a great
   alleviation. And methinks the love of God in this world should not be
   so strictly urged; or though we should not live in the exercise of this
   duty, it should not be represented as so very great a crime." Therefore
   in answer to this we are to evince to you according to what was
   proposed: [60]

   II. The greatness and heinousness of the sin of not loving God,
   notwithstanding this excuse that we do not see him: that it not only
   leaves it a sin still, but a most horrid one. And this will appear if
   we consider sundry things that I have to mention to you, which will
   shew it to be injurious to ourselves and others, but chiefly to the
   blessed God himself, the great Author of our being.

   1. It cannot but be a most horrid thing, inasmuch as it is a most
   injurious distortion of our natural faculties. And therein it is
   injurious even to ourselves, to our own nature, and to God the great
   Author and Parent of all nature, at once. For what do we think he has
   given us such faculties for, as we find the nature of man to be
   enriched with? Why hath he given us a mind, originally capable of
   knowing him, and that could once retain God in his knowledge; or a will
   that could then embrace him by love? It must needs be "very injurious
   perversion of our own faculties, to withhold and divert them from the
   prime, the best and highest use, whereof they were originally capable.
   And it is a very unaccountable thing that it should be thus, that man
   should have a power given him, originally ordained by the very
   designation of the God of nature to such and such purposes, and that it
   should never be applied there unto. Not to love God is to set those
   faculties one against the other, and both of them against him.

   2. It is a most vile debasing of ourselves, and a sordid depression of
   our own souls. By love we most strictly join ourselves to that which is
   the object of our love, and enter into the closest and most inward
   union with it. And what is it that we love, while we love not God? Are
   not the things which our love terminates upon, such as we should even
   be ashamed to think of separately and apart from him? What is there
   that is not base, when severed from God, or if we do not eye and
   consider him in it? We cannot conceive of any creature whatsoever, not
   even of the best and most noble, but as of a most horrid idol, if made
   the terminative object of our love, taken apart from God, and not
   considered or regarded in subordination to him who is supreme. And as
   to the mind and spirit of a man, there is nothing that so defiles it,
   that renders it so impure as spiritual idolatry does. A vile and filthy
   thing, that the spirit of a man should be alienated from God, and
   prostituted to an idol! For we make any thing so, that we make the
   supreme object of our love. And so in effect we join ourselves to
   vanity, as idols are wont to be called; to that which is not only vain,
   but by this means made odious and loathsome.

   And how deep a resentment should this be to us, that so excellent a
   thing as the spirit of man, God's own offspring, should suffer so vile
   a dejection! that it should he depressed and debased unto such meanness
   as to join itself to vanity and dirt, when it might be united with the
   God of glory, with the fulness and excellency of the Deity; yea, and
   when it is apparent, that by the original designation of that nature he
   hath given us, we were at first made capable thereof! For how came we
   by that love which we find in our nature? We plainly see we can love
   somewhere? While we love not God there is something or other that we do
   love; yea and it is altogether impossible to our nature, not to love
   something or other. And hath he "planted a vineyard and shall he not
   eat of the fruit thereof?" 1 Cor. ix. 7. He hath planted that love in
   our natures which we have made vile, by alienating it from him, and
   which may yet be made a sacred thing by being sanctified and turned
   upon God again. For it is the object and a suitableness thereunto,
   wherein consists the sanctification of the affections. And again,

   3. Not to love "God is a most merciless self-destruction. It is a
   divulsion of ourselves from him who is our life. It is to rend our
   souls from the Supreme Good, and so abandon ourselves by our own choice
   unto misery. How infamous among men is the name of a felo de se, one
   that hath done violence to his own life, and perisheth by his own
   hands! Though the nature of the thing doth exempt him from personal
   punishment in this world; yet you know that human laws do very severely
   animadvert upon, and punish the crime as far as the matter can admit.
   Juries are impanelled, a strict inquiry is made into the nature of the
   case. "What did he do it voluntarily? was he compos sui? did he
   understand himself when he did it?" And if this be found to be the
   case; his goods are confiscated, and his memory branded with all the
   infamy that can be devised. And there is a great deal of reason for it.
   For the wrong that is done does not terminate upon himself, or his own
   relatives; but the prince is wronged, being robbed of a subject; and
   the community is wronged also, being deprived of one that otherwise
   might have been a useful member.

   No man, as I remember Cicero somewhere speaks, Nemo sibi nascitur, is
   born for himself. Many claim a part in us besides ourselves, to wit,
   our prince, our country, and our friends. And when one destroys
   himself, many are injured by that self-destruction. And though some
   heathens have spoken of self-destruction as a very noble and generous
   act, yet Plato who had more light (speaking, as I remember, to this
   very case) says, "We are here in the body like soldiers in a garrison,
   who are not to stir out without the general's order and direction; no
   more may any one dare to go out of the body, till the great Ruler of
   the world, who hath placed him there, gives him leave, or a call." And
   he appeals to men themselves. "If you" (saith he) "had a slave that
   should kill himself, would you not say he had wronged you, as well as
   himself, who had an interest in him and his service?" And what! do we
   think all this while that God's dominion is less over our spiritual and
   eternal being? over these souls of ours that are capable of being
   employed in his love and praise eternally? And is not this injurious to
   him, that men, who are naturally capable of all this, should yet throw
   themselves off from God, and cast themselves among a crew of damned
   spirits, whose business will be always to curse their Maker? Is not
   this, I say, an injury to the blessed God himself, who is the Author of
   that being and capacity to serve him, which we find ourselves possessed
   of? Moreover,

   4. By not loving God we render ourselves altogether incapable of doing
   him any faithful service, upon which our great comfort and advantage,
   and his honour and glory do at once depend. For God is glorified only
   by our voluntary action and devotedness to him, And is it not also more
   pleasant to serve God cheerfully than otherwise? but can we do that
   without loving him? And doth it not cast a most intolerable calumny
   upon him, that we should serve such a master unpleasantly, and with
   uncheerful service? Further,

   5. We should, in breaking of this one law of love to God, break all. It
   is a breach of all the law at once, and so makes us incapable of doing
   God any service at all. For we can never serve him while we obey him
   not, and we can never obey him without love. We find that the whole law
   is summed up in it. Therefore we break the whole law of love to God in
   epitome, when we do not love him. All the law is fulfilled and
   comprehended in the one word Love. And though it is plain that the
   Apostle when he says (Rom. xiii. 8, 10.) "Love is the fulfilling of the
   law," speaks there with a more direct reference to love to men, or one
   another; yet it is plain too that both branches may be reduced to one;
   for no man loves his brother or neighbour truly, if he do not love him
   for God's sake, and upon his account. That great law against murder in
   the book of Genesis (ix. 6.) is founded upon this reason, "For in the
   image of God made he man;" so that it is God who is principally struck
   at, when one man murders another. Thus our Saviour made the summary of
   the law twofold, when he said, (to the lawyer, who had asked him, which
   was the great commandment,) "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
   thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; and thy
   neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and
   the prophets." Matt. xxii. 37-40.

   The whole of our duty therefore centers in this one thing, love to God.
   This is the radical principle whence all is to proceed; and every
   command doth bind us with this reduplication, "Do this and love God,
   and do that as a lover of God," otherwise what we do is no more the
   same thing which the law enjoins, than the carcass of a man is the man.
   That which is the soul of the duty is wanting, and that is love. What
   signify, think you, those prayers to God, which are put up by one that
   does not love him? or of what avail is any other act of worship that is
   performed by such a one? And if we do any part of our duty which
   respects man, and that duty be not animated by the love of God, the
   love that one man can have to another in this case is nothing else but
   a sort of friendly intercourse among rebels, that have cut off
   themselves from their supreme Ruler; and take no more notice of his
   interest which he hath in common in them, but as they are confederated,
   and join in a conspiracy against him. Love among men, why do we talk of
   that? To love such men as have quite cut off themselves from God, as
   well as we ourselves have done, is only such a love as is among rebels,
   that treat one another kindly in a state of rebellion. To proceed,

   6. It is a violation of the most merciful indulgent law, enjoining us a
   duty most agreeable to our own necessities, and the least toilsome and
   expensive of all others. How intolerable then is it to affront God, and
   even to do it with no pretence of advantage to ourselves, but greatly
   to our own disadvantage and loss! How merciful is the law of love! how
   direct a provision is there made in it for the necessity of man! Pray
   what shall we do, nay what can we do with ourselves, if we place not
   our love upon God? It may be we do not find our present need of him, as
   long as we find objects of sense courting and flattering us in our way;
   but do not we know that this world must break up, and this frame of
   earth and flesh in which we dwell, dissolve! What then will become of
   him at last that will be found to have been no lover of God? How
   dreadful a thing is it for a soul to be stripped naked and to have
   nothing to enjoy! It cannot enjoy God, because it never loved him. For
   sure, what we love not, we can never enjoy.

   Therefore it was a most merciful law that said unto us, w Love the Lord
   your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your
   strength." It is a law teaching us to be happy, and to solace ourselves
   in the rich plenitude of divine goodness. Our necessity doth at once
   urge us, and the divine goodness invite us here to place our love. This
   is the true solution of Plato's riddle, "That Love is the daughter of
   Pluto and Penia." For it plainly appears that the rich plenty of divine
   goodness, and the poverty and indigence of the poor creature that
   cannot otherwise dispose of itself, are the true parents of love.

   This is a thing also that will cost us nothing. To love God therefore
   is the most unexceptionable thing in the world. It is what we are
   capable of in the worst external circumstances. If a man he never so
   poor he may yet love God. If he be sick and infirm, if lie be never so
   mean, if he have no estate, no interest, or be never so little in
   repute, he is yet capable of loving God. This he can do any where, in
   any place, in any desert, or cave, or upon the most afflictive bed of
   languishing. There is no pretence against loving God, let a man's case
   be what it will, or supposed to be. it is therefore a most intolerable
   thing to offend against a law that provides so directly for our
   happiness and most urgent necessities. It is such a law, an obedience
   to which will cost us nothing, neither can there be the least pretence
   of gaining any thing by the neglect of it. The sin is therefore the
   more horrid: and foul and shameful it is to disobey in a case wherein
   we have nothing to say for ourselves. And again,

   7. It is a direct contradiction to our own light, and the common
   sentiments of mankind. For this is no disputable thing, whether we are
   to love God yea or no. There are many things in religion, and many
   things more that are affixed to it, that make much matter of
   disputation, and great ventilating of arguments, there is pro and con,
   this way and that; but pray who can tell how to form an argument
   against the love of God? To deny this is to affront our own light, and
   that of the world in common; for there is no man that will profess
   himself to be no lover of God. Did you ever meet with any one that
   would profess enmity to him? And the soul of man cannot be indifferent
   in this case. It must either be a friend or an enemy, must cither love
   or hate. God is not indifferent, or a mere nothing to us, and how
   should we be affected to him, if not by love? And we further add,

   8. It is a most unnatural wickedness to the Parent of that being which
   we are each of us furnished with, to disaffect our own Original. That
   men should disaffect him from whom they immediately sprang, and whose
   image they expressly bear, is, I say, a most unnatural crime. Suppose
   there were a son to be found that never could love his father, and
   always hated the womb that bare him; what a strange prodigy in nature
   would he be thought! But is not this infinitely more prodigious to
   disaffect the entire and supreme Author of our own life and being, of
   which parents are but partial, or at most but subordinate authors. And
   in the

   9. And last place, not to add more, it is blasphemy against the divine
   goodness. It is a practical blasphemy. It is the most emphatical way of
   denying God. For as the man that does not believe him, denieth his
   truth and makes him a liar, so by manifest parity, he that doth not
   love him denieth his goodness, a great deal more significantly than can
   be done by words. For men many times earnestly speak what is not their
   settled judgment, and what they are afterwards ready to retract. But
   how horrid a thing is this, that a man by a continued course and series
   of practice should discover this to be the fixed sense of his soul,
   that God is not worthy of his love! that a race of reasonable creatures
   should bear their joint testimony against the great and blessed God,
   the common Author and Cause of all being, that he is not worthy the
   love of any of them! For we practically say so while we live in the
   neglect of this duty. What do we talk of words in this case, when deeds
   and our constant practice do more significantly and directly speak? and
   what doth the course of a man speak, who loves not God, but this, that
   he is not to be loved? Therefore sure, not to love God, though we see
   him not, is not only a sin, but a most monstrous and horrid one.

   We should go on to make some practical inferences from all that has
   been said on this part of our subject, that we might thereby the more
   closely apply all; but of this hereafter.

SERMON IX. [61]

   IN speaking to the second part of our subject we have largely insisted
   in shewing you, that our not seeing God is no excuse for our not loving
   him. We have shewn particularly, that it is insufficient, and also very
   absurd to be alleged as an excuse; and that it is not only a sinful
   omission, but a most horrid wickedness, not to live in the exercise of
   love to God, notwithstanding this excuse that we cannot see him.

   It now remains, as we promised in our last, to deduce from the whole
   some practical inferences, by which (if God will so direct his word)
   all may be applied, and brought home with the greater pungency to our
   own hearts. And,

   1. We may hence take notice of the insolent wickedness of the world,
   that they so generally agree to confine the little love that is left in
   it to one another, and to exclude the Blessed God. That men do not love
   God speaks them very wicked: that they continue in the neglect of this
   duty, without any excuse, speaks the insolency of their wickedness.
   While they .have not a cloak left them, not a colourable pretence, nor
   any thing to say for themselves that is so much as plausible, yet they
   continue their course of excluding God out of their hearts, and live as
   if they owed him nothing, and had no concern at all with him.

   That men do not love God is a thing that cannot be excused, as you have
   heard; and it is as little capable of denial, as of excuse. The matter
   is open and manifest. The general face and aspect of this world
   sheweth, how little there is of the love of God in it. The very shew of
   its countenance speaks it plainly. Men do in this matter even declare
   their sin as Sodom. They openly testify to one another that they are
   God's enemies. So that every man that runs, may read how the matter
   commonly is with men in this respect.

   Alas, how little doth God's interest signify in this world! this shews
   how little he is beloved. How little is his interest valued, in
   comparison of that which is merely secular, and human! We have
   instanced to you already in this and many other things, for the
   eviction of the matter of fact in this case. As for the matter of right
   and wrong in the case, you have fully seen, from the demonstration
   which hath been given you, that our not seeing, excuseth us not from
   loving God. Nothing can be more plain, than (as we noted heretofore)
   that although too little respect be paid in the most important matters
   to human laws, yet there is a great deal less paid to divine. Men are
   more prone to be observant of the laws of men than of God. But there is
   no true obedience to the one or the other which doth not proceed from
   love, so far as it is true. We are to owe nothing to any man but love,
   or what may spring from thence. It was the complaint you know of old,
   "The statutes of Omri are kept." Micah vi. 16. A very scrupulous care,
   as is intimated and complained of, there was to observe them; while the
   statutes of God were neglected, or not so much respected among those
   that professed his name.

   Yea, and which Is more than that; how much more frequent are the
   instances that may be assigned of laws made directly against God's
   interest, and the precepts of the first table, than against those of
   the second! The world in the several successive ages of it, hath been
   full of instances of laws made for polytheism, infidelity, idolatry,
   the worshipping of false gods, and the abolishing, or very much
   depraving the worship of the true. But when did you ever hear of laws
   made for theft, false witness bearing, and the like? so as to oblige
   men under certain penal ties to invade each other's interests, as they
   generally make bold with God. We have heard and read very frequently of
   men persecuted even to the death by laws, for not burning incense to
   idols, for not denying of Christ, and the like; but when did you ever
   hear of a man exposed to such penalties for not stealing, for not
   cozening, not defrauding this, or that, or the other man? So apparent
   is it, that men can express somewhat of tenderness one to another, in
   respect of their own private and secular interest; when, in the mean
   time, there is no concern at all for the common interest of the Lord of
   all this world. So that what interest is in the world is shut up almost
   entirely among men themselves. And though there is too little regard to
   that interest; yet they confine what there is among one another,
   excluding the blessed God from having any part or share in their love
   at all.

   And truly, sirs, I fear we are too little concerned about this sad
   case. We do not consider this matter as it deserves, nor with that
   solemnity that it challenges. We are not so affected about the rights
   and interest of him, whom we call our God, as we ought to be. It doth
   not pain us to the heart as it should, to think how little God is made
   of in his own creation, and among the works of his own hands. We
   sometimes, when we hear the matter spoken of, say it is a sad case, but
   we know not how to help it, and so pass it very slightly over. But do
   not we indeed know how to help it r And should not this affect us ten
   thousand times more, when it is a case, that we can only lament? Sure
   methinks, at least we should do that if we can do no more. But how
   prone are we to alleviate the matter by considering it as a common
   case. "Oh! this is a matter of observation every day. It may be seen in
   every place, that there is little of the love of God to be found among
   men." And is it a common case? Is it not then a thousand times more
   horrid that it should be so common? If there had been but one apostate
   creature from God in all the world, one person of whom it might be
   said, "He doth not love God," how shocking and horrid would this man
   look in our eye! But is it not inconceivably worse and more horrid,
   that there should be so general a revolt from God? and that the hearts
   and love of his poor creatures are so averted without cause, and
   wickedly alienated from him all the world over?

   2. We further collect hence, that the conviction of the unreconciled
   part of the world must needs be very clear and easy in the great day.
   When this shall be the common case brought into trial (as indeed it
   will be with every man) "Was he a lover of God, or was he not?" how
   easy and clear, I say, must the conviction needs be, since, as you have
   heard, it is a matter that admits of no excuse? If this be a matter not
   defensible at our own bar, among ourselves, when we controvert the
   matter one with another; how easily and gloriously will divine justice
   triumph in the eviction of his right, and of the wrong, that hath been
   done him by his creatures in the matter? Be hold a whole race of
   creatures, originally capable of his love and communion, gone off from
   him with one consent! alienated in heart and spirit, from the life and
   love of God! transmitting their enmity and disloyalty from age to age,
   from generation to generation! and, in a word, emboldening themselves
   in wickedness against him, because they see him not; and as they vainly
   think, because he sees not them.

   And yet in the mean time it is very plain, that men might know him if
   they would; for they live, and move, and have their whole subsistence
   in, and by him. He is not far from any one of them. He supplies them
   with breath from moment to moment. They entirely owe themselves, their
   being, and preservation, to an every where present, and apprehensible
   Deity. Yet they do not, neither will they know him; and in this
   voluntary ignorance they sufficiently shew, that they love him not. How
   glorious then will the triumphs of justice be, when this case comes to
   be stated! when this shall be the charge brought against men, be they
   who they will, or whatsoever they have been in other respects, that
   they have been no lovers of God.

   3. We are hence to note, and admire the wonderful patience, and bounty
   of God to this wretched world. How admirable are the riches of his
   goodness, and his sparing and sustaining mercy! that the treasures of
   wrath are shut up, and the treasures of bounty opened to a world, where
   he hath, upon the matter, but little or no love! One would wonder that
   this world should not have been in flames many an age ago, considering
   how enmity against God hath been transmitted from age to age. But how
   much more reason have we to wonder, that he so concerns himself about,
   and takes such care for a company of wretched miscreants, among whom he
   is not valued! Still his treasures are opened to us; his sun shines,
   his rain falls, and in ways of grace and mercy he leaves not himself
   without witness, in that he is continually doing us good, "Giving rain
   from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and
   gladness;" (Acts xiv. 17) though in the mean time men will not know who
   feeds them, and maintains their life; and parcels out their breath to
   them, every moment, from time to time.

   Surely it becomes us deeply to adore that patience and bounty, that are
   so continually exercised towards such creatures, who are here shut up
   in the dark, as it were, from one day to another. God appears not to
   them; they see him not, and in the mean time agree in this, that they
   will have no thoughts of him, but have him in perpetual oblivion. Yet
   all the while they have natural powers and faculties, which if employed
   in the inquiry, might easily inform them, that they did not make
   themselves; that they have not their life in their own hands, neither
   can they prolong it at their own pleasure, inasmuch as all of us "live,
   and move, and have our being in God." Acts xvii. 28. However, they
   content themselves with their ignorance of him; and yet he hath
   sustained the world, and upheld the pillars of it, when sometimes it
   hath been ready to dissolve, and burst asunder, with that weight of
   wickedness that hath overwhelmed it for a time.

   We ought surely in the contemplation of this to say, "How far are his
   ways above our ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts!" Men
   sometimes when they receive but a petty injury, and an apparent wrong
   from another, are presently wondering, that the earth doth not swallow
   up the man that hath done them this palpable wrong; that vengeance
   spares him; or that God suffers such a one to live. Oh! why do not we
   turn all our wonder this way; that God spares those that are
   perpetually affronting him! making it as it were the whole business of
   their life to testify to all the world, how little they care for him
   that made them! We ought then to consider with great admiration that
   vast and immense goodness, which is so indulgent to men all this while.
   Again,

   4. We may hence learn too, the absolute necessity, and proper business
   of the Redeemer; how great need there was of a Redeemer, and what work
   and business he has to do on the behalf of sinful men. We may learn, I
   say, how great need there was of such a one. For who can stand under
   the weight of this charge, to have lived days, and months, and years in
   this world, destitute of the love of God? Any man that apprehends the
   horror of the thing, and knows how inexcusable a wickedness it is, and
   how horrid, notwithstanding any pretence of excuse, cannot but be
   greatly affected by it; methinks paleness must possess his face, and
   pining his heart, to be subject to so heavy a charge, and also liable
   to be convicted of not loving God. And then, one would think, it should
   be easy to understand what need there was of a Redeemer. The creation
   would not be able to sustain this burden, to have creatures in it that
   loved not God, and were disaffected to their own Original. If this
   guilt were to be parceled out among the creation, how soon would it
   make all things fly asunder! and how impossible would it be for things
   to subsist and hold together! How great then was the need of a Redeemer
   in this case!

   And we may see what his business hereupon must be also; that is, both
   to expiate the guilt of such as have not loved God, and to procure that
   they may do so for the time to come. And these two we are to consider
   not as separate and apart from one another. We are not to fancy or
   imagine, that Christ hath only this to do, namely, to procure pardon
   for our not having loved God. Sure he is to procure grace also, that we
   may, and effectually shall do so for the future, or else he will profit
   us but little. If we have to do with Christ at all, if ever we receive
   any benefit at all by him, it must be this double benefit in
   conjunction; not the one separate from the other.

   The imagination runs in common among men, as if Christ's business as
   mediator was only to reconcile God to man, and not man to God. But how
   expressly doth the Scripture speak of this part too! You that were
   sometime alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now
   hath he reconciled. Col. i. 21. He must reconcile us to God. And
   therefore the apostle again saith, that God was in Christ reconciling
   the world to himself. 2. Cor. v. 19. To take out of the hearts of men
   the enmity that is reigning every where against God, and bring them
   into love with him, is the very business of the gospel.

   There did not need a gospel to be preached to heaven, to incline God to
   man; but there was a necessity of dispensing one on earth to men, to
   incline them to God. If the business had only been to reconcile God to
   man, there had been no need of a gospel at all. The affair of our
   redemption might have been transacted between the Father, and the Son,
   in God's eternal counsel. Christ might have died as he did, and the
   ends of his dying be never known to us, were it not that this was the
   means, that the Spirit of Christ was to work by, in order to overcome
   men's hearts, and slay the enmity in them, not to be done by any other
   way. And shall any of us think, that Christ came into the world to
   procure the salvation of those, that loved not God? This were to think,
   that he came into the world to banish the love of God out of it.

   Therefore we must know, that if ever we be the better for Christ it
   must be both in his expiating our guilt, for not loving God; and in
   removing our enmity, that our love may be set upon him, our hearts
   joined with him, and engaged in communion and fellowship with him, in
   our future course. For this is the business of a Mediator between God
   and man: to salve the breach on both sides; to make a mutual agreement
   between both parties; to vindicate God's right, and so to act the part
   of a just Redeemer, and to procure man's righteousness, which is the
   part of a merciful Redeemer. This was his thought: "This case must be
   either redressed in men by working a change in them, or else vindicated
   upon them." This he is obliged to as Redeemer. The Father hath given
   all judgment into his hand; and as it were, deposited his rights there,
   to be vindicated by him, or restored. John v. 22.

   5. Learn hence the generous nature of divine love in men. The love that
   we owe, and that good souls do live in the exercise of, and actually
   bear to God, of how noble and generous a nature I say, is it? Their
   love is of so refined and solid a nature, that it breaks through the
   whole sphere of sense, and flies above all visible things, and pitcheth
   upon an invisible object. There it terminates, and takes up its
   residence. It never rests till it has flown up thither, and seeks no
   excuse from the duty of love to God, merely because he is invisible. It
   despiseth to be so excused, and neglects, and disregards the dictates
   of sense in the case. This is the genius of divine love and the inward
   spiritual sense of the new creature, whereof this love is the heart,
   and life, and soul. "What! shall external sense impose upon me, and
   tell me what is fit for me to love, and what not? What! shall I love no
   higher than so? no higher than a brute?" Therefore, how much more noble
   and excellent a spirit is that of the truly good man, than the men of
   this world are of! and how excellent is the spirit of divine love,
   which is in the saints, above that which is earthly and sensual! Let us
   believe this therefore, and be convinced, that the spirit that is
   peculiar to godly men is quite another thing, from a vulgar and mundane
   spirit; and its strain and genius different, from that of the men of
   this world. These love only what they see, and think they are excused
   from loving any but sensible objects. But says the good man, "When I
   have seen, and viewed all the good, and all the excellency that this
   sensible creation can offer to my view, I must have something unseen
   for my love to pitch upon which is beyond all this." Therefore a
   gracious spirit is an excellent spirit. It cannot grovel upon this
   earth. It must ascend above all visible things, and get up to that God
   who is invisible.

   6. Since we are so strictly obliged to the love of God though we cannot
   see him; what reason have we to charge and condemn ourselves, and even
   loathe and abhor ourselves that we have loved him so little, and that
   so small a part of our life can be said to have been spent in this
   divine exercise! It is high time for us to understand the state of our
   case, and to consider it in this respect: though it is very much to be
   feared that it is but little considered; for alas, how generally do
   people carry it as if they thought themselves innocent in this point!
   After all the injury that has been done to God by our not loving him,
   this is the most intolerable aggravation that we should think ourselves
   innocent therein, and maintain that temper of spirit as if we
   apprehended all was well. And how plain is it that it will not enter
   into the souls of men, that they are guilty creatures before the Lord
   on this account, that they have not loved him?

   If a man had secretly and privily been guilty of the death of another
   on such a day, and the matter was closely covered up and no body knew
   it; yet how would his own thoughts dog him and accuse him at night! The
   blood of that man would so cry in his conscience, that certainly he
   would have but a hard matter of it to compose himself to quiet peaceful
   repose. Why, men in not loving God are guilty of deicide, as much as
   they can be, or as far as their power extends. It is an attempt against
   God. It is saying in their hearts, "No God!" For it is a plain denial
   of his goodness, and therefore of his being. It is as much a denial of
   his goodness, as infidelity is of his truth. What a strange thing is
   it, that men can be so much at peace with themselves, can pass over
   whole days one after another, yet no such thing as the love of God to
   be found among them! and at night can sleep and rest, and their hearts
   never smite them for it.

   Methinks it is strange that men can make so slight a matter of breaking
   all laws at once, as you have heard this is of not loving God; of
   subverting the whole frame of the divine government over us. For how do
   we obey it in any thing, who comport not with the first principle of
   obedience, namely love to God? Oh that men should be guilty of a more
   horrid fact, than it would be, if it were in their power, to turn all
   things out of order, and yet not only be able to rest but even to think
   themselves innocent all the while!

   These things, in my apprehension, do make a most wonderful conjuncture,
   where they happen to meet together; these four things especially,--that
   it should be so plain to every man that he ought to love God,--that it
   should be so plainly demonstrable, as to the most, that they do not
   love God; that it should be so confessedly a foul and horrid thing not
   to love him, even by every man's acknowledgement; and yet,--that so
   many can be guilty of this horrid crime all their lives, and yet live
   as if all was well, and they were innocent all the while.--All these
   things make, I say, an amazing conjuncture. I appeal to you if they do
   not.

   But that none of us may be so stupid under such guilt as this, let us
   since we cannot excuse it, freely condemn ourselves. For who is there
   among us but must be forced to acknowledge, that the love of God is too
   little exercised, or is very faint and languid among us? Methinks we
   should hate ourselves for this, that we do not love God. It ought to be
   looked upon as a frightful thing, a monstrous indisposition in us. We
   should then in our own thoughts, commune with ourselves, and reason
   thus. "Why, what a creature am I! what a strange creature am I! of how
   amazing a composition! I have an understanding about me. I know that
   which is good and what is best. I know the Author of all goodness and
   excellency, must needs be the highest excellency and goodness himself.
   I have also love in my nature, which I can employ upon inferior things,
   and which I confess to be of unspeakably less, and of diminutive
   goodness. How monstrously strange is it then that I cannot feel daily
   emotions of love in my heart to God! that I cannot find my heart to
   beat for him! that every thought of him is not pleasant to me! How
   amazing and wonderful is this!" Why sure it is a very befitting
   posture, that we should be covered with shame and confusion before the
   Lord; and be even wallowing in our own tears, lamenting that there
   should be so stupid and cool an ascent in our hearts towards him: that
   we can spend whole days without him; give him no visits, and receive
   none that are of concernment to us; and in a word, lead our life as it
   were without God in the world.

   It should make us ashamed to read that precept of an heathen emperor,
   [62] who expresses himself to this effect, and, "You must lead your
   lives with God. Then," says he, "you will be said to lead your life
   with God, when you approve yourselves well pleased with every thing
   that he dispenseth to you, and take all kindly at his hands; and when
   also you obey that leader and ruler," (he can mean nothing but the
   conscience that is in man) "which he has set to be the guide of your
   actions. So shall you lead your lives with God, and have daily converse
   with him." And now to have daily our conversation in the world without
   God, and yet have no scruple about it, nor remorse upon it, is a
   marvellous thing; especially among us, who hear of him and from him so
   often, and know that we must be happy in him at last, or else eternally
   miserable. In the

   Last place, Since our not seeing God cannot excuse us from loving him,
   how much we are concerned to see to it that it be no hindrance or
   impediment to this our duty of loving God. And that it may not, it is
   very necessary that it be some way or other supplied. Since it is
   impossible for us to see God, we ought to consider seriously with
   ourselves, whether there be not something or other that may serve us
   instead of the sight of God, and be a means of our living in his love.
   And here I had several things in my thoughts to have hinted to you, and
   intended to have gone through them at this time; but I must leave them
   to the next opportunity.

SERMON X. [63]

   SINCE it is necessary, that our not seeing God should be so supplied,
   as that we may be capable of loving him, notwithstanding; I now proceed
   to give some directions, which I hope will be of use to us in this
   great and important matter. As,

   1 Let us fix the apprehension deep in our souls, of his certain
   necessary existence, and supreme excellence. Our sight doth not serve
   us to the loving of any thing, otherwise than as it is a means to beget
   an apprehension in our minds of the loveliness of it. Sight is in no
   case the immediate inducement of love, but only as it is ministerial
   and subservient to the nobler powers of the mind. And if by any other
   means than by seeing, we can come to apprehend so much concerning the
   blessed God, to wit, his most necessary existence, and supreme
   excellency, we shall not be at a loss then for an apt medium, by which
   our love is to be excited in us towards him.

   These two things are the same in effect with those that the apostle
   tells us we ought to be assured of, in order to our coming to God with
   acceptance, namely, that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him. Heb. xi. 6. We may easily understand how he is a
   rewarder, if we compare this passage with what is said to Abraham, I am
   thy exceeding great reward. Gen. xv. 1. God is at once both a rewarder,
   and a reward to those whose hearts are towards him. He is a rewarder by
   communicating himself, and not by giving rewards alien and diverse from
   himself. And it is necessary that we be assured, that he both is, and
   that he is in this sense a rewarder, as being in himself the highest
   excellency, or the supreme and best Good. For without a persuasion
   concerning both these, it is intimated, that we cannot come unto him in
   an acceptable manner.

   Now loving him is one way of coming to him. It is that by which the
   soul moveth to him in desire, and then rests in him in delight. There
   can be no such motion in the soul towards God, without this double
   persuasion concerning him; namely, of his certain existence, and
   highest excellency, as our terminative good. And you have heard that we
   may be as sure of both these, as of any thing that we see with our
   eyes. For if our eyes tell us, that any thing is in being, our minds
   tell us as certainly, that there is an original Being. And if we can be
   any way sure, that there is such a thing as goodness, and excellency in
   the world; we may be as sure, that there is an original excellency, an
   original good, which must needs be the supreme good, and can be no
   where, but in the original supreme Being. For goodness and excellency
   are not nothing, and therefore cannot come out of nothing, but must
   proceed from the same fountain, from whence all being comes. We are not
   more sure of any thing that our eyes inform us of, than we shall be of
   this, if we do but consider, and use our understanding in the case.

   So that we should endeavour once to fix the apprehension of these
   things, as being most certainly true; and from our very souls should
   bless God, that we are at a certainty in these things; that we do not
   feel the ground loose under us, but are in this respect on firm ground,
   when we affirm that God most necessarily is, and is the highest and
   most excellent Good. And being once sure of this, it would be very
   unreasonable to be recalling this matter into doubt, or to be
   perpetually moving questions and disputes concerning it in our minds.
   It is what we may be as sure of, as that there is a world in being, or
   that any thing is, that we ourselves are, who being nearest to
   ourselves, may be surest of our own being.

   And it would make strange confused work In the world, if in reference
   to all the actions of man, they should be ever moving disputes about
   them, whether they really are or are not. As if a man could not tell
   how to eat, but he must fall a doubting presently, "Is this real food
   before me, or is it not? or am I awake to eat it, yea or no?" Or as if
   he could not tell how to converse with any one, about never so
   important a business, but he must fall a disputing, "Is this a real
   man, or but a spectre? may it not be only the umbra of a man?" In
   short, what could be done, what business transacted in the world, if
   about such plain matters, doubts must be perpetually raised?

   Every man that hath understanding, as hath been said, may be at as
   great certainty concerning the existence of the supreme and first
   Being, as of any thing whatever. Nay, a great deal more, because his
   existence is supremely necessary. So that if I confine certainty to the
   eye, then I am sure of nothing but what I see. But I am certain that
   God always was of himself, and therefore is necessarily; and so, not to
   be, must to him be simply impossible. This, therefore would be one
   great supply to our not seeing him, once to make the matter plain and
   clear, that he exists, and that he is the most excellent and supreme
   Good. Which would be a great deal in our way, towards the exercise of
   love to God, though we do not see him.

   2. It will concern us much to use our thoughts in being conversant with
   other invisible objects. For certainly, minds and hearts that are
   continually busied about things of sense only, will be but in a very
   defective capacity, at all times, to converse with the invisible God.
   It needs a very refined temper of mind to behold him with the
   intellectual eye, and thereupon to love and embrace the blessed
   glorious God. And as while we converse with things that are vain, our
   minds are vain; while with things that are earthly, our minds are
   earthly, and bear the impress and image of those things with which we
   have most to do; so, if we did but converse with spiritual things, or
   those which are above the reach of sense, it would be a means to make
   our minds and hearts grow more spiritual, and consequently more fit for
   the love, and converse of the eternal, supreme, invisible Spirit.

   It is a mean base thing, since God hath furnished our natures with a
   thinking power, to use our thoughts only about those things that lie in
   common to us with brute creatures. Can I, have I, a power to mind
   higher and nobler objects, and will I so vilely debase myself as not to
   mind them! to mind only things that are earthy, drossy, and terrene! By
   this means I shall always keep myself in an incapacity to have to do
   with God."

   We should therefore consider with ourselves, that as we have faculties
   by which we are rendered capable of conversing with men and visible
   things; so we have faculties too in our natures, whereby we are capable
   of conversing with things that are not visible, and that are of a
   higher nature. It is easy to turn all the things of this visible state
   into a dusky shadow to ourselves. We can clothe all the world with
   darkness, in a moment, only by shutting our eyes. And therefore as our
   eyes would signify nothing to visible things, if we did not use them;
   so nor will our thoughts signify any thing in reference to the
   invisible world, unless we employ them upon their more proper, and
   peculiar objects.

   We should also recollect with ourselves, that there is such a thing as
   an invisible world, which is the best and noblest part of the creation
   of God. We ourselves, as to the better part of our natures, belong to
   it. Therefore we should not behave as strangers, and unrelated to that
   world. We should consider how glorious the invisible world is, and
   recount who are its In habitants, what are the affairs and pleasures,
   the excellencies and ornaments of those inhabitants. Let us think with
   ourselves, what vast numberless myriads there are of glorious spirits,
   creatures of God, that are composed all of mind and love, whose
   perpetual business and employment is to behold, and adore the great
   Father of spirits, the PATERNAL MIND, or REASON, as the Heathen have
   called him, the original intellect, that is every where and ALL IN ALL.

   We should think with ourselves, that the affairs of those in numerable
   multitudes of glorious spirits, and their pleasures and delights, are
   the same. Their business is to be always beholding the divine glory;
   and by adoration and praise to return it to him, reflecting it back
   again to its own Original. We should think with ourselves, what the
   lovely ornaments and excellencies are of those blessed inhabitants: we
   should consider their vast knowledge, their mighty power, their pure
   holiness, their profound humility, the benignity, love, and serenity,
   that are every where to be found among those happy beings.

   And when we have thought and considered all this, then let us ask
   ourselves, "Why am I a stranger to this invisible world?" For indeed we
   are strangers to it, while we are unrelated to God, and his Christ. But
   this is not our necessity, but our great folly, that we continue in so
   distant and unrelated a state. We are naturally aliens, strangers,
   foreigners; but there are overtures made to us by Christ, to become of
   the household and family of God. Eph. ii. 19. And his family is made up
   of heavenly ones, though part be in heaven, and part on earth. Our Lord
   Jesus Christ himself, besides his natural, hath an acquired dominion
   and lordship over the whole of it. By him were all things made, both
   visible and invisible; and even besides that, by the blood of his
   cross, he is become the Head over all principalities, and powers, and
   thrones, and dominions; whether they be in heaven, or earth, or under
   the earth. Col. i. 16-21.

   So that if we be of those who profess themselves to be christians, and
   are united to him, we are come to an innumerable company of angels, and
   the spirits of the just made perfect. Heb. xii. 22, 23. We are actually
   joined as members of that body, which is all but one community of
   glorious creatures above, and holy ones here below, in whom the
   beginnings and first principles of the new creature, and the work of
   sanctification are to be found. So that we may again demand of
   ourselves and ask, "Why do we estrange ourselves and carry it as if we
   were unrelated to those invisible creatures?" Those blessed spirits are
   continually mingling with us, if we will believe the divine testimony
   concerning them. The angel of the Lord encampeth about them that fear
   him, and delivereth them, Ps. xxxiv. 7. And what are all the angels?
   But ministering spirits sent forth for the good and service of them who
   are heirs of salvation. Heb. i. 14. They are conversant in our
   assemblies, as some understand that passage in the first epistle to the
   Corinthians, where the woman is directed to have power over her head,
   that is, a vail, in token of her subjection to power, "because of the
   angels;" (1 Cor. xi. 10.) though some understand this passage
   otherwise. And again, more expressly it is said, that unto powers and
   principalities in heavenly places is known by the church the manifold
   wisdom of God. Eph. iii. 10.

   Therefore in that we do not entertain more frequent thoughts, and
   exercise our minds more about what the Scriptures reveal in this
   matter, we are certainly injurious to ourselves. We keep back our minds
   from being clarified from earth and sensible things, by which they
   might be raised up to the honour and advantage of being employed about
   the blessed God himself. For if we were filled, all the day long, with
   becoming thoughts of the state and condition of the affairs of the
   inhabitants of the invisible world, how easy were it to fix upon God
   the great Ruler of all, the Father of spirits.

   And being of the same community, making but one society with those
   blessed creatures, as being under 4he same Head with them, we make a
   great schism in the body if we break off ourselves from them, and their
   employments and affairs, and involve ourselves with things that are
   visible, and the objects of sense. Of all men in the world the
   sensualist is the greatest schismatic. He breaks himself off from all
   the affairs and concernments of the invisible world; and wraps himself
   in, this narrow sphere, as one quite cut off from God, and all that are
   more immediately conversant with him. We, I say, quite rend ourselves
   from that body, that happy society, if we do not apply ourselves more
   to mind the concernments of that other; world, and to have our spirits,
   thoughts and affections, exercised and carried up thither. And again,

   3. It is necessary in order to supply our not seeing God, that we most
   firmly believe the report and testimony that is given of him in the
   gospel of his Son. What we cannot know by our own eyes, we must be
   beholden for the knowledge of to the report of others. And it is the
   business of the gospel to make a re=port of God to us, and the errand
   of his Son into the world was to bring us this report. He who best knew
   him, and from eternity was in his bosom, "hath declared him;" and that
   on purpose for our relief in this case, because "no man hath seen God
   at any time." Since therefore God is invisible, and we are creatures
   that depend so much upon sense, he "hath spoken to us by his Son, the
   express image of his person." Heb. i. 3. So that it is by no mean one
   that he hath sent us an account of himself, though we cannot see him.

   All reports signify as they are believed. They signify nothing where no
   credit is given to them. But what should induce us to doubt, whether
   the revelation which Christ hath made to us of God, in his word, be
   true or no? What should make us imagine, that God should misrepresent
   himself? What! Doth he need to beguile us, his creatures, whom he hath
   entirely in his power? the works of his hands, whom he can wink and
   beckon into nothing? Do you think he means to beguile us with specious
   representations of himself, otherwise than the matter really is?

   Therefore we should thus consider with ourselves. "We have not indeed
   seen God, nor is he liable to so mean a thing as human sight. But we
   have an express discovery of him by his own Son, who came upon this
   very errand: and what he has said was not casually, and on the by, as
   words dropped by chance; but he came for this very end, that he might
   acquaint the world what God is, and give to men an account of him,
   since he is not to be seen with eyes of flesh." And sure, upon the
   account we have of this blessed and glorious Object, he must be
   acknowledged to be the most lovely Object. We are not then at a loss
   for an object of our love, if we will but believe the record, and
   testimony of the blessed God in his own word; and take it as a
   revelation from heaven with so merciful a design. How awful an
   acquiescence therefore doth that challenge and command! So that our
   hearts should readily suggest to us, that it is the greatest
   profaneness, if we do not with reverence, and veneration admit that
   testimony.

   In what honour and veneration had those poor deluded creatures the
   image that was said to have come down from Jupiter! Acts xix. 35. Why,
   God's own word is his own lively image, a true representation of
   himself, which certainly came down, from himself. He hath sent many on
   this message; his own. Son, his prophets, and apostles, on purpose to
   draw men into communion and fellowship with himself. These things,
   saith St. John, are written, that we might have fellowship with the
   Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 1 John i. 3. And then he goes on
   in his epistle to tell them, that the message which the apostles heard
   of him and declared unto them, was this--that God is light, and God is
   love. 1 John i. 5. &c. Surely then such a Being is the most worthy of
   our esteem and love; and the message sent to men is most worthy of
   their acceptance, to wit, that such a God is offered to them for their
   God. Thus men are acquainted with him by the revelation they have of
   him in the gospel, that so they may be drawn into a communion and
   fellowship with him, the life and soul of which is love.

   4. It is necessary, that we bend ourselves much to contemplate and
   study the nature of God, according to the discovery we have of him in
   his revelation. That which we do know and believe, makes an impression
   upon us only as it is improved by our thoughts; as it is considered or
   not considered. A great many things lie asleep in our souls, and
   signify nothing to us, for want of actual thought. At certain times and
   seasons, therefore, we should say to ourselves; "Well! I will now go on
   purpose, and sit down, and meditate upon God. This shall be the
   business of the present hour." For surely nothing can with higher right
   lay claim to our entire thoughts, than the Author of all. And it is a
   strange piece of negligence, that he, with whom we have such great
   concerns, and who is our All in all, should be so seldom the Subject of
   our solemn, designed, purposed meditation; that the thoughts of God
   should be casualties with us; that we should think of him only now and
   then by chance, and never find a time, wherein we may say to ourselves,
   "I will now on set purpose think of God."

   How doth this correspond with the practice of the saints, who had
   communion with him of old? as we find the Psalmist intimating, that he
   thought of God on his bed, and meditated on him in the night-watches.
   Ps. lxiii. 6. I would not here propound to you the indulging, or
   gratifying of a vain curiosity, inquiring into the unrevealed things of
   God; but would recommend to you the study of those plain intelligible
   attributes of his, that are obvious to the understandings of the
   generality of men, because the Divine Being is not capable of a strict
   and rigid definition. These are enough to suggest such a notion of him,
   as renders him an Object worthy of our love and worship; while a
   multitude of things may be supposed concerning God, which it is not
   necessary for us to be acquainted with.

   Consider then his wisdom, power, goodness, holiness, and the like,
   which are his communicable attributes; and add to these the
   incommunicable properties of his eternity, his immensity, his
   self-sufficiency, his self-subsistence, his necessary existence, and so
   we have an account of God. And then how excellent and glorious an
   Object both of love and worship have we before us! a Being of himself
   originally perfect; who is essential wisdom, goodness, love, truth,
   righteousness, and holiness. In what a transport should we be upon such
   a representation of God! We have his name often in our mouths, when it
   is with us but as an empty sound; as if that great, and venerable name
   signified nothing. He is near in our mouths, and ears, but far from our
   hearts; and then no wonder he is so little loved all the while. But
   would we once admit to have our souls possessed with the apprehension
   of the import of that mighty and venerable name, which was given to
   Moses; how would it engage us to bow our heads and worship him, who is
   "the Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, longsuffering, abundant
   in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thou sands, forgiving
   iniquity, transgression, and sin, and that will by no means clear the
   guilty." Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7. Our Lord told the Samaritan woman, "Ye
   worship ye know not what." John iv. 22. So do they, who make his
   worship nothing else but a ceremonious compliment; the mere bowing of
   the knee, and the honouring him with the lip. But if it be the worship
   of love, it is impossible then that we should worship we know not what.
   For the interior faculties of the soul, as to love and desire, cannot
   be wrought upon by a shadow. They must be moved by something
   substantial, and set on work by something on purpose which really
   exists. When therefore we hear the name of God spoken, how should it
   make us stoop and bow before him! and into what an awful and pleasing
   commotion should it put all the powers of our souls at once! But to go
   a whole day, and forget God; and to let many days pass, without ever
   choosing a time to think of him, is a great iniquity. And while that
   iniquity abounds, the love of such must needs grow cold. And then
   again,

   5, We must take heed, that we entertain no horrid and dismal thoughts
   of God, and that we believe nothing that is contrary to his own
   revelation of himself. Take heed lest the belief of a God suggest only
   a guilty enslaving fear. I mean not the fear of reverence, which the
   angels owe and pay; but that fear of horror, which is most proper to
   devils, and is the product of a diabolical faith. "The devils believe
   and tremble." Ja. ii. 19. They believe and are full of horror, as the
   word phrissonsi signifies. Do even shiver with the belief they have
   concerning God. As "perfect love casteth out fear," so such fear will
   always put out love. For a fear proceeding from gross and horrid
   mis-persuasions concerning God, must needs stifle all dutiful,
   ingenuous, loyal affection to God.

   It is the great art of the devil to possess men with the apprehension,
   if it be possible, that their case is the same with his own, that so
   thereby they may make it their own. If the devils can once persuade
   men, that God is as unreconcilable to them, as he is to themselves, who
   sinned with open eyes, without a tempter, and all at once in their own
   proper persons; if they can, I say, but make men believe this, then it
   is a most easy thing to keep the love of God from ever having any
   entrance into the soul. It is natural to hate those, whom we fear or
   dread; therefore, I say, the fallen angels believe and tremble,
   believe, and are full of horror.

   But, do you believe, and bless God? Believe him actually reconciled, if
   you find your hearts do yield to him, Believe him willing to be at
   peace. Believe him when he testifies, that whosoever cometh to him
   shall in no wise be cast out. John vi. 18. Believe him saying, "Though
   thou hast forgotten me, and hast set up thyself to be thine own idol,
   and hast been perpetually affronting me; yet do thou but accept my Son,
   and of pardon in and through him, and I will make thee my friend, my
   associate and my son." Do but believe this, and try if it be in your
   power not to love him. This faith will certainly work by love. But take
   heed of believing what God hath never said; and what the destroyer of
   souls would make you believe he hath said. For whatsoever thoughts tend
   to the making him unlovely, or not amiable in your eyes, have them far
   from you. And

   6. Make him your own by an entire, and cheerful choice, and acceptance
   of him for your Lord and your God. How mightily doth relation,
   interest, and property command love! You cannot see him it is true, but
   you may choose and apprehend him for your God; which relation, once
   understood, will happily supply the want of seeing him. Surely you
   would love your own child, your own father, your own husband, or wife,
   though you were born blind and could never see them. How many are apt
   to say, when they observe any thing lovely, in such or such a relation
   in another family; for instance, a dutiful, ingenuous child, "Oh had I
   such a one, how should I love him I" Why, you have an amiable
   description of your God; and do not your hearts say within you, "If he
   were my God, how should I love him?" And why is he not your God? he
   offers himself to be yours, and has put no harder terms upon you, than
   that you receive him for your God. Comply then with his righteous law,
   "Thou shalt have no other Gods before me." Exod. xx. 3. Say therefore,
   "Thou shalt be my God wholly and alone." As every covenant is made up
   by a mutual stipulation, so his willingness and yours make the bargain.
   He hath declared his own willingness, do you but make out yours, and
   the matter is effected, so as that none can tear you asunder.

   And how pleasant a thing is it to have such a God your own to glory in,
   and to walk in his name! to be able to say, "God, even my God shall
   bless me! I need no other." How high matter of triumph was this to the
   Psalmist! Let it be told to the generations following, This God is our
   God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even unto death. Ps.
   xlviii. 13, 14. As if he had said, We are willing that this should be
   known, in the present, and succeeding ages, Let it be transmitted to
   posterity. Let there be a perpetual everlasting monument of this, that
   we have had the Lord for our God. Thus a certain noble person would
   have an inscription put upon his tomb, without any further enlargement,
   to this effect, That he had been a servant to queen Elizabeth,
   counsellor to king James, and friend to sir Philip Sidney. By this it
   appears he would have all ages know whose servant, counsellor, and
   friend be had been. [64] In like manner should every good and pious
   soul declare to the present, and all future ages, that THE LORD IS HIS
   God.

   7. Let your souls be filled with this apprehension, that God is always
   and every where present. How sweetly moving are those thoughts of God's
   omnipresence in the 139 Psalm! They were so to the Psalmist and are so
   to all the saints. "Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? or whither
   shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art
   there; if I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there. If I take the
   wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even
   there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. If I
   say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light
   about me. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth
   as the day; the darkness, and the light, are both alike to thee." And
   when the royal Psalmist considered, how God insinuated himself into
   every bone of his flesh, and particle of his frame, saying, "Thou hast
   possessed my reins, thou hast covered me in my mother's womb;" he
   breaks out at last in to these words, "How precious also are thy
   thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!"

   Let us then but habituate ourselves to the apprehension of an every
   where present Deity, conceiving all things filled with the divine
   fulness, and this will supply the defect, or the want of seeing God.
   Let every creature, every place, every providence, put us in mind of
   God. Thus begins, and ends the eighth psalm, the design of which is to
   contemplate God in these things, regarding them all as the works of his
   hands; "How excellent is thy name, O God, in all the earth, who hast
   set thy glory above the heavens!" And what an ecstasy do we find Moses
   in, while he is celebrating a particular providence! "Who is like unto
   thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness,
   fearful in praises, doing wonders?" Exod. xv. 11. If then we did but
   labour to make this thought familiar to ourselves, that whithersoever
   we go, or wherever we are, we have a God to behold; that there are
   footsteps of God, everywhere, for us to take notice of, or impressions,
   and prints of his glory; this would habituate us to his converse, and
   make the motions and exercises of love, easy and familiar to us. This
   effect it had on the Psalmist in the 104 Psalm, who. after a glorious
   description of God, thus closeth it up; "My meditation of him shall be
   sweet, I will be glad in the Lord." Ps. civ. 34. He had been viewing
   God, as he was to be seen in the works of his hands; and his spirit was
   now drenched deeply in the thoughts of God's active power and
   providence, every where diffused in the world.

   We, in like manner, should always have such thoughts injected into us,
   if we would but consider with ourselves, that wherever we are, still we
   live, and move and have our being in God. The whole earth is full of
   his glory. By him all things consist. We can set a foot no where but
   still we tread upon his ground, and are in his dominion. We cannot
   live, but by a vital influence derived from him, How much would this
   contribute to the facilitating the exercises of love! By converse love
   insinuates itself into persons, they are captivated before they are
   aware. And there is no man of so morose, sour, churlish a nature, but
   will have a sort of kindness for such, whom he converseth frequently
   with. Assiduous converse wins hearts. How much more, when we have such
   an amiable object, should we associate with him! It will then ensue of
   course, that we shall be taken with him, and drawn by the cords of love
   into the happy bonds.

   8. And lastly: Let us pray much and earnestly for the Spirit of life
   and love, which is his own gift. Among the many excellent fruits of the
   Spirit you see love leads the van. Gal. v. 22. It is of considerable
   moment to state the case to ourselves thus; "The love of God is one of
   the fruits of his own Spirit." How intent then should we be upon this,
   that he who claims to be the Object of our love, is pleased to be the
   Author of it? even of that pure, refined love, that is fit to be set
   upon so glorious an Object. Whereas such a carnalized, impure, drossy
   love as ours, can never turn itself unto God; will always decline, and
   shun that blessed Object. He must form our love for himself, or it will
   never do.

   As he therefore makes our love the sum of his law, and of all his
   precepts, so we should make it the sum of all our requests. For it is
   at once indeed both our privilege, and our duty. Both what we are to
   do, and what we are to enjoy, are all summed up In love. And if we make
   this the sum of our desires, how much of ingenuity would there be in
   this prayer, when we come to the Lord and say, "Lord if I should cast
   all my desires into one request, it is love! Love is the only thing. I
   beg only a heart to love thee." How much ingenuity is there, I say, in
   such a prayer! and how great also is the necessity of it! For we can as
   soon pluck down a star, or create a new sun, as plant in our own souls
   this principle of love to God, without his aid. Every good and perfect
   gift is from him; and certainly this is good, and a matter of high
   excellency, to have the heart possessed with his love. We can never
   understand the love of God to us, till our souls are, as it were,
   trans-elemated into a love to him. God is love, and he that dwelleth in
   love dwelleth in God and God in him. 1 John iv. 16.

   And now, after all this would we be excused from the duty of loving
   God? that is, from being happy, from living a life of pleasure, from
   solacing ourselves with the immense Good? We should methinks as little
   wish to be excused, as a poor indigent man from having all his wants
   supplied; or a sick languishing person, from returning to health and
   strength; or a hungry fainting person, from receiving convenient food;
   or a weary person, from receiving refreshing ease and rest. Would we be
   excused from having God for our portion, our health and strength, our
   rest and all in all? We cannot indeed see God; but will that excuse us,
   when so many things present us with an idea and image of him? or when
   we have the privilege of addressing ourselves to him by prayer? The
   Scriptures do not speak to us in this matter with any intention or
   design to excuse us from this duty. There it is intimated, that all the
   good, which concerns a man's present state, comes from love to God.
   All, says the Apostle, shall work together for good, to them that love
   God. Rom. viii. 28. And with respect to the other world, it is said
   that, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into
   the heart of man to conceive, what God hath laid up for them that love
   him. 1 Cor. ii. 9.

   And if we would but consider the matter, it is plain we can not excuse
   our conduct, to ourselves; much less to God. For do not our consciences
   tell us, that nothing is so easy, nothing so ready? And it is likewise
   to be considered, what will be made of this one day. I make little
   doubt but one very great part of the torture of hell, will lie in a too
   late repentance; that we never loved what our convicted consciences
   must needs have told us was most congruous, and fit to be loved. When
   an awakened soul shall make reflection, and consider, what infinite
   reason there was for the loving of God, and yet it could never be
   brought to it; we can conceive no sort of mental torture to be more
   tormenting than this. So that they, who live destitute of the love of
   God, and content themselves with so doing, are busily preparing their
   own hell all their days. Oh, how tormenting will be the reflection! "I
   lived a life's time in the world, and knew how reasonable a thing it
   was, how just and righteous to love God, and yet I never did love him!"
   This will be a most amazing subject for thought to feed upon, and to
   find torment by, through out an eternal state. And therefore we are the
   more concerned to be restless in our spirits, till we feel the fire so
   to burn within us, and can make our appeal to God, saying, Thou knowest
   all things, Lord! thou knowest that I love thee. John xxi. 17.

SERMON XI. [65]

   WE have endeavoured from these words to evince to yon the indispensable
   obligation there is upon us to the continued exercise of love to God,
   notwithstanding that we can not see him. This hath been doctrinally
   discoursed of, and also insisted upon by way of use, and particular
   application of that doctrine; but before we pass from it, it will be
   requisite to add somewhat further of a casuistical import.

   It is very plain, that though there are not many sincere lovers of God,
   in this world; yet there are but few, who pretend not to be so. They
   are apt to please themselves with the conceit that they love God, and
   so take the matter for granted, though there be nothing of any such
   affection in their hearts at all. Others there are, who are apt to
   suspect that they do not love him in sincerity, and are too forward to
   conclude, that they have none of this divine affection, because they do
   not perceive it to work towards God, as their love does towards other
   objects. Finally, there are others again, who are very prone to censure
   those that speak of more passionate workings of affection to God, as
   mere hypocrites for this pretension. For since they experience nothing
   of such workings on their own hearts, they think it impossible there
   should be any such thing at all in the world. There are therefore three
   sorts of persons that our present discourse must have reference unto.

   I. Such ignorant and careless souls as do, at random and without ever
   considering the matter, pronounce concerning themselves, that they are
   lovers of God; though if the matter be strictly looked into, they have
   no such thing as a motion of love in their heart to God at all.

   II. Those that are prone to suspect, and conclude themselves to have no
   love to God at all, because they do not find this affection to work
   with that fervour and constancy, that they think it should, and which
   they perceive on other occasions.

   HI. Such as are very apt to suspect, and accuse others of hypocrisy or
   folly, who seem to express the most passionate and fervent love to God,
   and think that such an affection towards him cannot have place in a
   human breast. What therefore is pretended to be of a spiritual and holy
   kind, must be resolved, they imagine, wholly into enthusiasm; or be
   attributed to the power of fancy, or imagination; or to the temper, and
   disposition of the bodily humours, and the various structure and fabric
   even of the inferior parts of the body itself. To each of these sorts,
   reference must be had in what is now to be discoursed upon at this
   time.

   I. As to those who confidently give out themselves to be lovers of God,
   though they never felt any motion of love to him at all in their
   hearts, such things as these it would be very fit for them to consider.

   1. That it is a very rash and unreasonable, as well as dangerous
   presumption, for them to conclude there is that in them which they have
   never perceived at all. For what might not one imagine, or fancy upon
   such a pretence? Supposing it possible, must I believe every thing to
   be true which is barely possible to be true? How many absurd things
   should I then believe! For there are many things that possibly may be,
   which yet it would be a very great absurdity to believe are in reality.
   It is a known rule, that of things that appear not, nor exist, the same
   esteem is to be had. If then it no way appears, or however appears not
   to me, that I am a lover of God; with what confidence can I pretend to
   it, or say that I am so?

   2. It is to be considered that it is a most natural thing to men to be
   very indulgent to themselves, and to think that of themselves, which
   none would think or imagine but themselves. It is natural to every
   wicked man to "flatter himself in his own eyes, until his wickedness be
   found out to be hateful." Ps. xxxvi. 2. Thus says the Psalmist, "The
   transgression of the wicked saith within my heart," that is, suggests
   to me, "that there is no fear of God before his eyes." Ps. xxxvi. 1 And
   truly this does as effectually speak or declare, that he hath not the
   love of God in him; yet at the same time he flatters himself, as it
   there follows, in his own eyes, till the matter comes to be plainly
   observable to every eye. Hence it may be very well understood, how it
   comes to pass that men are so apt to judge themselves any thing, which
   it would be horrid for them not to be thought to be, only from the
   kindness they have to themselves. For how horrid is it for any man to
   admit himself to be no lover of God! Therefore he must needs think
   himself such, or affirm that as true, which it were a horrid thing to
   confess and avow to be false. And so, upon the matter, their love to
   God depends upon, and runs into nothing else, but a partial and fond
   love to themselves.

   3. They should consider how obvious the mistake is, to take a
   conviction of conscience in this case for an affection of the heart.
   That is, because they are convinced that it is a very reasonable and
   fit thing to love God, therefore they conclude, that they do love him.
   But how most irrational is the conclusion! They may as well conclude
   their approbation of any thing else, to be the possession of the thing
   itself. For instance, that they are rich, because they approve of
   riches; or that they are in very good health, because they approve of a
   sound habit of body. It is plain that this is all which the most can
   say, as to the bottom of their pretence. They have nothing at all in
   them, like the love of God, but only this conviction of conscience,
   that it is fit he should be loved. Of this there is a necessary and
   unavoidable approbation imposed upon their judgment, from the evidence
   of the thing itself. And as all men are convinced, that the obligation
   is indispensable, therefore they are willing to take it for granted,
   that they have the love of God in them.

   4. It follows, as another thing to be considered, that if the love of
   God in itself be really a distinct thing, and different from such a
   conviction, then their love to him is reduced to nothing: for it is
   really nothing, distinguished from such a conviction, or apprehension
   in their own minds. And under a notion of its being an affection of a
   finer kind and nature than to be obvious to common observation, they
   have refined it quite away, even into a mere nothing. For doth not
   every man's own sense tell him, that the love of tins or that thing, is
   quite another thing than a mental approbation of it? Or may not I be
   convinced in my judgment of the excellencies of one, to whom I have yet
   a settled aversion in my heart? How many cannot endure such persons, of
   whom upon conviction they cannot say they are not excellent men? And
   certainly it will put every sober considerer of this state of the case
   upon quite new thoughts, when we shall find he is not able to tell,
   what the thing Is, that he calls love to God, if it must be
   distinguished from the mere conviction of the reasonableness of it.

   5. It is also to be considered, that since love to God, if it he any
   where, is to be discerned and felt, and must be a ruling principle; it
   is then a most absurd imagination, that such a principle should be in
   men, of which they have no perception. For is it not absurd, that a
   principle, which is to have the conduct of a man's life, and so very
   great power in and over him in his whole course, should yet be neither
   discernible, nor felt? Indeed there are many thoughts and motions that
   stir in our minds, of which we take very little notice; nor can we in a
   little time say positively, whether we have such a thought or no. But
   that a principle, which runs through the universal course of a man's
   life, and which of all things should most frequently come under his
   notice, should yet be neither felt nor perceived by him, is the most
   unimaginable of all things we can conceive of. Therefore those who have
   so hastily pronounced themselves to be lovers of God, and yet never
   felt any thing by which this love is to be discerned, are besought to
   think again, to allow the cause a rehearing, to take it into new
   consideration, and not run away with a groundless conceit that they are
   what it so much concerns them actually to be, while they are only so in
   their own fancies and imaginations.

   II. I now come to the next sort, namely, those who are apt to judge
   themselves wholly destitute of sincere love to God, because they do not
   find those passionate motions of it towards him, as they do towards
   many inferior objects. And there are sundry considerations, which will
   be very requisite to be weighed in this ease too. As,

   1 That certainly the actual exercise of love towards God may be often
   intermitted, when an habitual propension of heart towards him doth
   remain. The soul may frequently be put beside the direct acts, and
   exercise of this duty; and yet that virtue and principle, which hath
   touched their hearts, and by gracious vouchsafement is seated there,
   may still habitually incline them the same way. As the needle touched
   with the load-stone, is frequently diverted from its direct tendency
   towards the north; for being moved it shakes and quivers, and hath its
   various vibrations this way and that, yet there is a virtue in it that
   will bring and reduce it to the right point again. Therefore it is not
   this, or that act of love towards God, that gives the denomination; but
   the habitual propension, and bent of the heart. A man then is to be
   esteemed a lover of God, according as his heart stands habitually
   propense to him. But if the denomination depend upon this, or the other
   act; then a man would cease to be a lover of God, as often as he
   loveth, or thinketh of any one else, or is diverted from it by this or
   that though never so necessary an occasion. And again,

   2. It is very necessary, that we consider the act and the passion of
   love as very distinguishable, or different things. The act of love in a
   reasonable intelligent creature, is nothing else but the complacential
   motion of the will towards this or that object, that is apprehended
   amiable, or worthy to be loved. The passion of love is the impression
   made by an object, upon the animal and vital spirits of the brain and
   heart, which, being sensible, are reflected upon, and by many are taken
   notice of (through a great mistake) as if the very notion and being of
   love was placed there. Whereas the whole entire nature of divine love
   is separable from that passion, and may be without it; otherwise if
   passion were of the essence of love, it were altogether impossible,
   that the separate soul should be capable of loving God, or any thing
   else. This is a mere accident to our love, and a result that depends
   upon our present union with the body; which body is essentially
   necessary, neither to our soul, nor to our love, for both may be
   without it. And I add,

   3. That those acts which are performed, as I may call it, in the upper
   region of the soul, and which are more peculiar to its intellectual
   nature, are as truly discernible, as the passions are which rebound
   upon, and affect the body. The acts of the mind, and of the will, are
   no more imperceptible than the passions; and it is as possible for me
   to be able to discern and feel the former, as the latter. Cannot I as
   well tell that I think such a thought, if I do think it; that I intend
   and purpose such a thing, if I do really entertain in my heart such a
   resolution, as that I feel the motions that affect my outward man? If
   therefore a person with a practical judgment esteems the blessed God to
   be his highest and best good, and accordingly chooses him as such, and
   settles this resolution in his own soul, saying, "This God shall be my
   God, my best and supreme Good, here will I seek my felicity, and take
   up my rest, and to him will I be an entirely devoted one for ever;" in
   this person certainly lies the substance and essence of love. And is
   not this perceptible? are not such acts as these capable of being
   reflected on, and taken notice of, if men would but more frequently
   turn their eyes inward, and habituate themselves to converse with
   themselves? But I further add,

   4. That most certain it is, that during our abode in the body, the
   affections of the soul have more intimately an influence upon it. Such
   is the close and mysterious union between these two natures of flesh
   and spirit; that the influences between the one and the other are
   reciprocal. And therefore it is that the very temper or complexion of
   our souls doth so naturally, some way or other, represent itself in the
   outward man, as that it is very difficult, almost impossible, to hide
   and conceal what are the sentiments of our spirits upon certain
   occasions. Whence it hath grown into a maxim, vultus est index animi:
   that the face is the. character of the mind. Heu, quam difficile est
   crimen non prodere vultu! How hard is it for a man not to betray guilt
   in his countenance, if he has the sense of it in his own mind and
   heart! And therefore we should consider with ourselves, how our
   affections work towards God; even according to the usual way, wherein
   human affections are wont to shew and discover themselves. For I add,

   5. That even spiritual, holy affections, such as respect the invisible
   God, and other invisible objects, do frequently so work in those pious
   souls in whom they are, as to make very great and deep impressions upon
   the body, and are accompanied with such passionate expressions, as are
   discernible, even to the inferior senses which belong to the animal
   nature. Let pas sages of Scripture to this purpose be looked into. How
   was the Psalmist affected and wrought upon by one affection towards
   God, when he tells us, "My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am
   afraid of thy judgments." Ps. cxix. 120. There is a proportion between
   fear and love, in this case. As for love, the same devout Psalmist
   says, "My soul thirsteth for thee, O God! yea my flesh longeth for
   thee." Ps. lxiii. 1 And again, "My heart and my flesh crieth out for
   the living God." Ps. lxxxiv. 2. Now these are not to be understood as
   mere rhetorical strains; for indeed they are not so, but do plainly
   carry this signification with them, that though the flesh be more
   immediately incapable of desire, of thirsting, and longing after God,
   whereof the soul alone is primarily capable, yet, mediately, the flesh
   partakes thereof. That is, the heart and soul did so much long after
   God, that the flesh was affected and bore the impression of that
   vehement desire, which was in the soul, as in its original and proper
   scat. We are therefore to consider, that even the more passionate
   workings of love towards God are very agreeable to that kind of
   affection, which in respect to the object, and principle of it, is
   spiritual and divine. And therefore,

   6. It must further be added, that if persons be very apt to be
   passionately affected in other kinds, and towards other objects, but do
   always find themselves dull, and insensible of such motions towards God
   and invisible things, they have a great deal of reason to suspect
   themselves to be under a very bad distemper. Indeed, when persons are
   equally, and alike, unapt to feel such passionate resentments in their
   hearts towards any kind of objects, the matter is quite otherwise. But
   if they can, ordinarily say, "I feel my love to work towards the
   creature, a relation, or other amiable objects in this and that
   passionate manner; but I can feel no love working towards God," they
   are far from being in a good condition They have, at least, a good deal
   of reason to suspect, that a distemper prevails upon them. Their love
   languisheth, and needs re-enforcement; and they ought not to content
   themselves to have the matter so, as if it were a case to be approved
   of, and that needed no redress. But yet again,

   7. We must consider, that tempers are very carefully to be
   distinguished. The temper of some men's minds is more composed,
   according as the bodily temper is more fixed, and their natural spirits
   are less volatile. Hence some are of a more even deportment to every
   object, even to the observation of others, and seldom are seen to be
   exalted, or depressed, whatever occurences happen to them in the course
   of their lives. They are not often seen, it may be, either to weep or
   laugh, to be either remarkably sad or cheerful. And grace, or this holy
   affection wherever it is in its subject, is somewhat conform to the
   natural temper of the person; as water poured into a vessel, resembleth
   the form of that vessel. If the vessel be round, then it resembles a
   round figure; if triangular, then it resembles a triangular figure. So
   I say grace and holy affections, where they are, resemble their
   subject, and receive in some sense a likeness and conformity to it, so
   as not to change the natural temper of the mind. Indeed the great
   business of the grace of God is to influence men as to morals, and not
   as to naturals. Therefore it were an unreasonable thing for any one to
   make himself a measure to all other persons, how much soever they
   differ in temper from him. Or that any one should make another such a
   standard to himself, that however it be with him as to his natural
   temper, he must be just such as others are; which is equally to aim at
   a thing both unnecessary and impossible. Further,

   8. We must warily distinguish between the exercise of love upon
   extraordinary, and sudden occasions, and such as are common and less
   surprising. As you know one may converse daily among the nearest
   relatives, and never feel any discernible pang of affection working
   towards them, as one docs to an object that suddenly appears. This
   proceeds from frequency and familiarity with them; when possibly the
   very same person would be in a transport upon the sudden and unexpected
   sight of the face of a friend, whom he had not seen for many years
   before. Now this is not inconsiderable as to our present case. It may
   be thus with many persons, who do not feel such a passionate pang of
   love towards persons, they daily converse with, as they do towards
   others, at the sight of whom they are surprised: yet notwithstanding
   this their love may be far dearer, and habitually much more strong to
   those relations whom they daily converse with, as occasions when
   administered abundantly shew; that is, they would do more for them, and
   be more deeply concerned if they saw them in distress, pain, and
   anguish. They would with much more regret endure separation from them,
   or take their deaths much more impatiently; which things shew their
   affections to be habitually much stronger, though upon sudden
   occasions, or in a certain juncture, they may work much more
   observably. And thus it may possibly be with some persons, who walk
   more evenly in their spirits before God. They have it may be fewer
   transports than others, who are of such uneven spirits, that the sight
   of God is often a new thing to them. They have him, less frequently out
   of sight, and are daily more conversant with him, and therefore are not
   subject to such violent emotions of mind. And if we compare these
   together, certainly we can never think, that there is a greater
   excellency in that temper which subjects a man, now and then, to higher
   transports of spiritual and divine affection, than in that temper of
   spirit, which is more steadily determined to a continual course of
   walking with God, in whom there is also an habitual complacence.

   Lastly, This is further to be considered, that if at any time one would
   try the sincerity of one's heart towards God, it is much more clearly
   to be evinced by the influence this hath on a man's life, than by the
   passionate or sensible impressions made upon the body. I say, we have a
   far surer evidence of our love to God, from the influence it has to
   govern and manage the course of our lives, than from all the passionate
   emotions, and resentments we may feel in the inferior parts of the
   outward man. Suppose such raptures, and transports, and ecstatical
   motions, as are very strange, and not without their delectation and
   pleasure: alas! these signify but little towards the evincing of true
   sincere love to God, in comparison of a stable course of living under
   his government, as persons who are beyond all things loath to offend
   and displease him. If you seek an evidence of the truth of your love to
   God, take this; "If ye love me keep my commandments." John xiv. 15. And
   again, "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments." 1 John
   v. 3. Though we must take heed here of thinking, as was formerly said,
   that the external effect is sufficient without the principle; or that a
   course of obedience, in outward acts, to the rules set before us, will
   do the business, though there be nothing of the principle of the love
   of God in us. But take these in connexion, the principle with the
   effect, and they are a great deal more pungent demonstrations of love,
   than mere transports of extraordinary affection, now and then, are.
   Agreeably to which our Lord says, "He that hath my commandments and
   keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me, shall be
   loved of my Father; and I will love him, and manifest myself unto him."
   John xiv. 21. And again, as it afterwards follows, "If any man love me,
   he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come
   unto him, and make our abode with him," ver. 23.

   So that we should take heed of putting too much upon the mere matter of
   passionate love in this case; unless, as we said before, it be
   manifestly discernable, that we can be passionately affected to any
   other kind of objects, while we find a stupidity, and dulness upon us,
   with respect to those, which are spiritual and divine. Therefore lay
   the great stress always here: "What doth the love, I pretend to,
   signify as to the conduct of my life? Do I live as a lover of God? as
   if it were an ungrateful matter to me, above all things, to displease
   him? as that I study, by all means possible, to maintain an intercourse
   of union, and communion between him and me? Is it such a love as makes
   his honour dear to me, so that I am above all things concerned not to
   disgrace the name which I bear, or be a reproach to him to whom I
   profess a relation? Is there such a principle in me as makes distance
   from God a wearisome thing? And would I fain be nearer to him daily,
   more acquainted with him, more conformed to him, and changed into his
   divine image and likeness?" If this is the influence that love to God
   hath upon our lives, it is the evidence, it is the thing, if any thing
   can be so, that must prove and demonstrate to ourselves the sincerity
   of our love.

SERMON XII. [66]

   WE have already in the preceding discourse offered sundry
   considerations to those, who are apt to take it for granted that they
   are lovers of God, though they never really discerned any motion of
   love to him in their hearts at all; or who fondly imagine that the
   conviction of their judgment in this matter, is to be taken for the
   affection of the heart. We have also spoken in several particulars to
   another sort, who suspect they are no true lovers of God, and are many
   times ready to conclude so; because their love to him is not so fervent
   and passionate as they think it ought to be. And now

   III. We come to the third sort that we have to do with, to, wit, those
   who are apt to censure other persons, merely upon this account; because
   they make profession of such a fervent love to God, as they themselves
   are altogether strangers to. All expressions of such a fervent
   passionate love to God fall under a suspicious censure, and accusation
   from these men. As for instance, they charge all such expressions of
   love with hypocrisy, or with enthusiasm: thinking it proceeds from,
   nothing else but a fantastic representation of the object they pretend
   to love; or else, they resolve it all into the temper of the body, and
   say it owes itself to nothing else but to such or such a crasis, a
   present habit and temperature, or a freer circulation of the blood, and
   quicker agitation of certain brisk and agile spirits. And thus they
   think that a mechanical account is to be given of all such kind of
   affections; and that whoso ever well understands the structure of the
   brain, or the nature of the spleen, and hypochondria, and the various
   twistings of the nerves about the veins and arteries, may very well be
   able to give a good account of all such kind of love.

   1 Now as to the first of these, to wit, the charge of hypocrisy, we
   must allow (as there will be further occasion to evince hereafter when
   we come to the last doctrine) that if any do pretend to such a love to
   God, and join with it an immoral conversation, there is a great deal of
   reason for the charge; and in such a case we must fall in with the
   accuser and say the same. But if this charge be fastened upon persons,
   whose walk and conversation is sober and just, we have then several
   things to say to it. As

   (1.) It is a most uncharitable censure to say that all pretence to a
   more fervent and vehement love to God, is for this very reason
   hypocritical. I wonder why so? Does not this seem to say, that there
   can be no such thing as a real, and fervent love to God? This is surely
   a very strange accusation, at once without warrant, and against the
   express law of charity, which requires us to "think no evil." 1 Cor.
   xiii. 5. And it is an essential character of it to be absolutely
   disinclined to take up an evil surmise, or bad thoughts of any one,
   where there is not a very manifest and apparent cause.

   (2.) The charge is most unreasonable. There is not the least ground for
   such a censure, supposing the persons to be in the main of a sober,
   just, and unexceptionable deportment among men. Of such it may most
   unrighteously be said, that they are hypocrites, while they pretend to
   love God. But how will you prove your charge? by what medium will you
   make it out, that all pretences of love to God, by such persons, are
   hypocritical? And surely that is most unreasonable censure, for which
   no reason can be given.

   (3.) Such a charge or accusation must needs proceed from a most idle
   and pragmatic temper. For these censurers shew themselves to be vain
   busy-bodies, who meddle out of their own province. But what have they
   to do to judge the hearts of other men? That is a province they have
   nothing at all to do in. What is it then but a vain pragmatic humour
   that prompts them to meddle in a sphere wherein they have no concern?
   "Who art thou," saith the Scripture, "that judgest another man's
   servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth". Rom. xiv. 4. Nay,

   (4.) It is to be guilty of the most insolent presumption; for it is to
   encroach upon the prerogative of God, to whom alone it belongs to
   search, and judge the heart. Who are they that take upon them to judge
   one another? "We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ."
   Rom. xiv. 10. Whoever they are that do judge so, they subject
   themselves to the judgment of God. Therefore says our Lord, "Judge not,
   that ye be not judged." Matt. vii. 1. That is, in effect, if you judge
   so at random, and where you have nothing to do, you shall know what
   judging means, when you shall be judged also.

   (5.) I would further say, by way of question, Pray what is the thing
   you find fault with in this case? Is it this love itself, or is it the
   appearance of it? Sure it will not be said, it is the love itself. Who
   would be so impudently profane as to say, it is a crime to love God? or
   that such love is criminal, when it is warm and vehement? as if it were
   possible to love God too much. Sure this will never be said by those
   who consider that we are required to "love him with all our heart, and
   with all our soul, and with all our mind." Matt. xxii. 37 And besides,
   this were to make the accusation to contradict itself; for whensoever
   the charge of hypocrisy is alleged against anyone, the thing pretended
   to is implied to be good and commendable.

   Or is it the appearance of such love that is found fault with? That is
   just the same thing as to find fault with the sun for shining. It is
   true, all discovery of this or any other excellency whatsoever ought to
   be modest, and sober; most remote from any thing of boasting or
   vain-glorious ostentation, than which, in such a case as this, nothing
   in all the world can be more fulsome. But what! should a man be ashamed
   to be come, and appear an earnest lover of God? Was the Psalmist shy of
   appearing so, when he again and again avowed it with so much solemnity?
   when he made professions of his love to God, which he designed, and no
   doubt knew would be recorded to all future times? And the noble
   personage whom we spoke of before, was he ashamed to have it recorded,
   that he was such a one's friend? It is so remarkable that we cannot
   look over a page in the book of Psalms, but we shall find some or other
   expression now made public to the world, of an avowed love to God. "I
   love the Lord," says he, "because he hath heard my voice and my
   supplications." Ps. cxvi. 1. And again, "I will love thee, O Lord my
   strength." xviii. 1. The word there used is most emphatically
   expressive of the most vehement, ardent, fervent love. "I will love
   thee from my very bowels." And what! is this a thing for a man to be
   ashamed of? to profess himself an earnest lover of God, if indeed he is
   so. He only has reason to be ashamed of saying he is so, who is not so
   in reality. But I say further,

   (6.) That this same accusation is hypocritical. It carries the most
   palpable hypocrisy in it; for it is manifest that such persons do only
   pretend to be angry at the pretence of love to God; when it plainly
   appears they are angry that the love of God should really be in any
   one. And this is easy to be made out. For do not all men generally
   profess love to God? Now they are not angry with those that profess,
   but love him not. But what religion is there without love? and whoever
   professes religion, does consequently profess love to God. But let them
   make it appear by their practice, that their profession is but a
   mockery, that they do but say, "Hail!" and strike at the divine Majesty
   at the same time; let them I say with their pretence of religion, or
   love to God, but join some practical signification that they are not in
   good earnest, and they please well enough, no fault is found with them.

   So that it is very plain the fault they are bent against is not
   hypocrisy, but sincerity. They are angry that there is any such thing
   as sincere love to God in the world. Therefore as Plato said to the
   Cynic, who trod upon a fine bed of his, and cried out, "I tread on
   Plato's pride," that he the Cynic discovered greater pride by this
   action; so we may say to these men who accuse professors of love to
   God, with hypocrisy, that it is with more hypocrisy. It is not the mere
   pretence of love to God, that they intend to accuse, as supposing it
   false, or that there is no such thing, but because they really suspect
   it is true. They think that such men have that in them, which they have
   not, and therefore they pass a kind of judgment upon them in their own
   consciences. This they cannot endure; and since they would fain malign
   them in their report, therefore they would do it as plausible as they
   can, and are more witty than to say, they censure them for loving
   truly, but for pretending to it falsely. But then again

   2 The affection of this kind is by some charged with enthusiasm. "If
   (say they) there be any such affection, it is altogether enthusiastic.
   It owes itself entirely to the fantastical representation of the
   object, and so can have nothing sincere, or genuine belonging to it."
   To this, I say,

   (1.) Why so? why must it needs be thought enthusiastical? What! because
   it is more than ordinarily vehement or fervent? as if no sober exercise
   or expression of love to God could be so. And we know too, though I lay
   very little stress upon it,

   (2.) That the name of enthusiasm hath sometimes had a gentler sound
   than now it hath; since the Empneustoi, and phrases signifying
   inspiration from God, are so frequently to be found in the writings of
   Plato, and others of the philosophers. And yet they were never twitted
   as enthusiasts, nor treated as if that name carried any thing of evil
   signification, or the import of a bad character in it. But

   (3.) Why should it be wondered at that there should be expressions of
   love to God which import great fervour and intenseness; since we know
   that such as have been professedly related and devoted to God
   heretofore, and of whom Scripture-records give us an account, have been
   all along very full of such expressions? What would they think of such
   expressions as these of David? "I opened my mouth, and panted; for I
   longed for thy commandments," Ps. cxix. 131. "My soul breaketh for the
   longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times." ver. 20. "Oh how
   love I thy holy law!" ver. 97. "As the hart panteth after the
   water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God." xlii. 1. Yea we
   find that there have been such appearances, and expressions obvious to
   view, of this divine spiritual affection, that have incurred the
   censure of insanity; and yet they have been reckoned a glory. Thus it
   was with David, who when he was censured for dancing before the Lord,
   answers, "I will play before the Lord, I will yet be more vile, &c." 2
   Sam vi. 21, 22. And says the apostle, "Whether we be besides ourselves
   it is to God; or whether we be sober it is for your cause: for the love
   of Christ constraineth us." 2 Cor. v. 13, 14. It is very likely he
   speaks here with reference to the censure of those false teachers, with
   whom you find him conflicting in that very chapter; as very frequently
   he does in both the epistles to the Corinthians, and also in others.
   They perhaps went about to represent him as a wild enthusiast; as one
   that was acted by an enthusiastical fury. Therefore he speaks according
   to their sense. Admit it, be it so; If I be really besides myself as
   they talk; it is the love of Christ which constrains me! He thinks
   himself not at all disparaged in the case. But I further say,

   (4 ) I make little doubt but many do attribute too much to rapture, and
   ecstatic motions and transports of otherwise pious love. I refer
   therefore to what was said under a foregoing head, especially to that
   distinction which was given you of the act, and of the passion of love,
   which are not only distinguishable, but sometimes plainly separable
   things. There may be very intense love, very strong and mighty love,
   where there is nothing of passion felt. This is a thing altogether
   accidental to the nature of love, which may be diverse and distinct
   from passion; otherwise there would be no such thing as loving God at
   all in any other way. And we must further say,

   (5.) That no doubt it is a very great fault to frame representations
   and ideas of God, and of divine things in our minds by the use of a
   liberty indulged to our own fancy and imagination, if therein we go
   beyond, or besides the warrant of his own revelation. And even there
   too we must be very careful, when we find God representing himself, or
   other matters of a divine and spiritual nature under borrowed
   expressions or similitudes, that we mind the thing that is to be
   represented, and held forth to us, and that we drain and defecate it
   from all the dregs of materiality, which belong to the metaphor;
   otherwise we may be greatly injurious, more than we are aware of, both
   to the divine honour, and to ourselves.

   Too many do greatly gratify the luxury of their fancies in such cases.
   We read of one, but very likely there may be more instances than one, I
   say we read of one, a popish female saint, who pretended in vision to
   such a communion with our Saviour, that forsooth she took upon her to
   describe him; what sort of eyes he had, and what kind of features; and
   pretended to be most passionately enamoured of him. And per haps there
   are too many over-prone to frame imaginations concerning the Deity,
   altogether unworthy of, and disagreeable to that glorious and
   ever-blessed Being; and having thereupon formed such and such ideas of
   him in their own minds, are variously affected according to the import
   of the idea about him. For instance, those of very melancholy tempers
   are apt to frame ideas altogether unlike God, and such as render him in
   their eyes a dreadful, and hateful object. Or if the idea be such as
   imports loveliness; yet if it be fantastical, and an affection of love
   be raised thereupon, it is most plain and evident that such a person is
   all the while but hugging his own shadow, and entertaining himself with
   an empty cloud, or an idol of his own forming. And I do not know
   wherein he is, less guilty, than in falling down before an image. When
   we do in our own fancies create a God to ourselves, and an
   extraordinary motion of affection is working towards it, in one kind or
   another, it is our own creature that we are all this while entertaining
   ourselves with, and not God. Therefore we ought to take heed that our
   apprehensions of things be scriptural and regular; such as that light
   which shines in God's word, or that clear flame which reason, when it
   argues according to the word of God, doth give us. Otherwise we are
   mere idolaters, while we imagine that we have only complacency in doing
   homage to God. But I add,

   Lastly, That the most regular, true, and rational apprehensions of God,
   do give ground for the most fervent and vehement love of him that is
   possible. And therefore it is a very foolish, idle thing, to charge
   love to God with being enthusiastical merely because it is fervent. For
   though it be such as answers truly, it can never answer fully such
   apprehensions of the object, as are agreeable to God, and such as God's
   own revelation gives ground and warrant for. Certainly there is no
   warrant to say that there is any thing of enthusiasm in such a pretence
   as this. There is no need that any such exorbitant digressions and
   excursions should be made to by-ways of representing God to ourselves,
   that so he may be amiable and lovely in our eyes. A true, and right
   apprehension of him, that is most agreeable to the Object itself, and
   his revelation, s the best and truest ground of the strongest and most
   vehement love. And certainly to a sober christian, a fantastical
   representation of a divine object will rather greatly cool and check
   his love, than contribute to the heat of it. But

   3. Such an affection, as we are speaking of, is by others resolved into
   the temper and disposition of the bodily humours; or the various
   structure of our frame, and the freer motion of the blood and animal
   spirits. And to this also it is,

   (1.) To be acknowledged that there is undoubtedly very much truth in
   the matter so far as that the affection may be the more intense, and
   exercised with a more sensible vigour, according as the body is so and
   so disposed, or as the habit of it is at that time.

   (2.) Do not we also know that there are pious men of all tempers and
   constitutions of body? and is not every man the more pious, by how much
   the more he is a lover of God? And

   (3.) Admit that bodily tempers signify any thing in this matter, that
   is, in the present exercise of the affections in general, what is to be
   inferred? Will it follow, that such an affection as this, in which the
   blood and spirits may be so and so concerned, hath therefore nothing
   spiritual and divine in it? which way should that follow? Why is it not
   as apprehensible, that divine and spiritual love may run in the same
   natural channel, and follow the same common course of operations with
   other love, as that wine and water may alternately flow through the
   same conduit pipes? Or why should it be more unreasonable and absurd,
   that divine and spiritual love should exert itself by the same
   corporeal organs with love of another kind, as having the same seat and
   subject, the faculties of the soul? I hope it is not one faculty in the
   soul that common love hath its seat in, and another faculty that divine
   love hath its seat in. Why should it be necessary there should be other
   internal organs for divine than, for common love, more than other
   external ones? Why may not divine love run the same course with common
   love in the respect that hath been mentioned? And why may not that be
   promoted, in its bent and exertions, by a brisk and quick agitation of
   the vital and animal spirits? What great inconvenience is there in
   this? Or what greater necessity is there for it to be otherwise, than
   there is for a man to have one pair of hands to do his common business,
   and another to lift up to God in prayer? May not a man speak of God or
   of divine things, and of other matters with the same tongue? and may
   not the same eyes which serve to read the Bible, serve to read any
   other book? But this carries more of folly, and foolery at the bottom,
   than to deserve more words to be said about it.

   Therefore to wind up all, Will we severally resolve, upon all that
   hat!) been at so many times discoursed to you upon this subject,
   namely, the love of an unseen God, are we I say resolved to apply
   ourselves in good earnest to the exercise and practice of it? It is a
   very dismal thing, if all our hearing at such times and occasions as
   these are, must be for nothing else, but only to give the ear a present
   pleasure. Or that we must take such an opportunity as this to meet
   together, only to see one another's faces, without ever minding to lay
   up a stock, and to add to a treasure of that light and grace, that may
   actually influence our future course. Certainly we should be most
   inexcusable persons, if after all this we should make as little
   conscience of the actual frequent exercise of love to God as
   heretofore. If any that have heard so much of this matter, shall go
   hereafter from day to day, and have reason to say, "This day I have not
   loved God at all, I do not know there has ever been a pleasant thought
   of him," and so indulge themselves in the liberty of running on in this
   course, it will not admit of being said all this hath been to no
   purpose. For it will certainly be found to have been to some purpose,
   but to a sad and dismal one, when the day comes, that every one must be
   judged according to the light they had. And the word that hath been
   spoken to those that live under the Gospel is that by which they must
   be judged.

   Let us bethink ourselves, What is our life, if love run not through it?
   if a vein of love to God be not carried through the course of it? Alas,
   without this, life is but a dream, and all our religion but a fancy!
   What do such assemblies as these signify! What a cold pitiful business
   is it, for so many of us to come together, if no love to God stir among
   us! We pretend to come to a God, whom we do not love. What a pitiful
   account can we give of our coming together, if this be all! The shew,
   and shadow of a duty! a holy flourish! and that is all. This, I say is
   all, if the love of God do not animate our worship.

   We cannot pretend to doubt whether God ought to be loved or no. It is a
   plain indisputable case. There are a great many things in religion,
   that are matter of doubt and disputation, and many things are made so
   more than need. And truly I take this occasion to say, it is no wonder
   there is so little love of God, and of true, living religion; because
   there is so much unnecessary disputing about the formalities of
   religion. It is a very sad and dreadful contemplation to think of, that
   so many persons can make the matters of religion a topic barely to
   please themselves with. If they can but toss an argument, cavil, and
   contend about this or that matter, then they are enamoured with, and
   highly applaud themselves, as if they could do some great thing in the
   business of religion; but all this while, and even by these very means,
   the love of God, and all practical religion vanishes. These things have
   exhausted, and wasted the strength, spirits, and vigour of religion
   itself, and made it look so languidly, and become so pitiful a thing as
   it is grown to be in our days; so that professors are now but the
   spectres, and umbrae of christians, mere skeletons. They are so in
   comparison of what christians were in former days, when every one might
   discern that in their behaviour, which might justly make them cry out,
   Aye! these are heavenly persons indeed! Heaven was seen in their
   converse, and all savoured of love to God. The Lord knoweth to what
   degree our religion is degenerated, and what it is like to come to at
   last!

   And let us consider with ourselves, that we fill up our days with
   calamities, and make our souls desolate, and forlorn; we involve
   ourselves in all manner of miseries by estranging ourselves from God,
   and not living in the actual exercise of love to him.

   Moreover let us consider that we are not always to live in this world.
   A dying hour doth expect us. We are hovering upon the brink of the
   grave. And what! is it a good preparation for death to live strangers
   to God, as long as we live in this world? Oh! with what horror must
   that thought strike a man in a dying hour, when his own heart shall
   tell him, "Thou hast not lived in the love of God!" Dare we, can we
   think, have we, I say, the confidence to think of going to God at
   length! to one that we have never loved, and to whom we have lived
   strangers all our days. But, oh blessed preparation for death! when a
   man shall be able, under the expectation of expiring his last breath,
   to reflect and say, that his life hath been a continual walk with God.
   How easy a death must that man die! Death conveys him to no stranger,
   to no unknown presence; to die, in regard to him, is but to know that
   Being better, whom he knew before; and to love him better whom he loved
   before; and to have those enjoyments improved in degree, with the
   nature and kind of which he had a former acquaintance.

   Let us then be serious, and in good earnest in this business; and know,
   we can never do any thing to purpose in it, if we labour not to have
   our spirits more entirely abstracted from the world. Alas! do we think
   we can serve two masters, God and the world? If we love the one, we
   shall despise the other; for as our Lord tells us, [67] we cannot love
   both. How often should these monitory, these weighty and wounding words
   be thought of, by them, whom they more especially concern? "If any man
   love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." 1 John ii. 15.
   Therefore saith the apostle, "Love not the world, neither the things
   that are in the world." And is not this a cutting word of our Saviour's
   to the Jews, "I know you, that you have not the love of God in you?
   [68] And would we be branded for such? We had need then to watch the
   more strictly over ourselves, when we have to do with the affairs of
   this world, that our spirits be not ruffled, nor suffer a discomposure
   by the amusements of sensible things, or the variety of occurrences and
   affairs that we meet with in this our earthly pilgrimage.

   Constant watchfulness, and much dependance upon God, and having him
   still before our eyes, would he a great help to us in this matter. It
   might make you wonder to hear, what some have professed to have
   attained unto, who were not of your religion. For instance, we are told
   of a nobleman of a foreign country, a romanist, who professed to have
   had such times, that when he passed along the streets of Paris, where
   continual diversions might easily have disturbed him, and could scarce
   be imagined to do otherwise, his soul was so taken up with God as to be
   no more moved, than if he had been in a desert. And Seneca himself, a
   pagan, writing a letter to his friend says to this purpose; for I
   remember not the very words, nor have lately seen the book. "You write
   to me to give you an account how I passed yesterday. Truly you have a
   very good opinion of me, to think I so pass a day as to be able to give
   you an account of what took it up. But since you desire it I will tell
   you. My window opens to the theatre, where are all the shews, and the
   noise and clamour that you well know the theatrical sports carry with
   them. Why (saith he) all these things (so much have I been taken up
   with divine matters) have no more moved me, than the whistling of the
   wind among the leaves of the trees in a wood &c."

   These things that I mention should be upbraiding to us, that we so
   little mind our spirits, and inward man, with the operative motions,
   and reflections thereof, and never look after a composed spirit, that
   is employed in minding God and taken up with the exercise of his love,
   through the worldly affairs and occurrences we meet with here. If we
   would do any thing to purpose in the exercise of love to God; if we
   would not be as those, that busy themselves about trifles; like the
   pharisaical hypocrites whom our Saviour speaks of, who were so zealous
   in tithing of mint, anise, and cummin, that in the mean while they
   forgot judgment, and mercy and the love of God; I say, if we would not
   be like them, but would do any thing to purpose, there must be times
   set apart for us to quit the world, with the torturing and distracting
   thoughts thereof, and let us labour to do it so totally as to forget
   that there is any thing in it but God, and misery.

SERMON XIII. [69]

   WE have largely insisted upon a twofold truth from these words, and
   told you,

   FIRST, That there is a greater difficulty of living in the exercise of
   love to God than towards man, upon this account, that he is not the
   object of sight as man is. And

   SECONDLY, That our obligation to the love of God is most indispensable,
   notwithstanding that we see him not; or, that the impossibility of
   seeing God, is no excuse for our not loving him. There is yet another
   point which remains to be considered, and which was at first proposed
   with the former; and that is

   THIRDLY, That they do most falsely, and absurdly pretend to the love of
   an unseen God, who love not their brother whom they do see. This point
   is full and direct in the eye of the text.

   It is manifest the apostle speaks here upon the notice he had taken,
   that there were some persons of very high pretensions to religion, and
   the love of God, who were yet manifestly and notoriously defective in
   the exercise and expression of love towards men, and even towards their
   fellow-christians. And he counts it therefore necessary to cast a slur
   upon that empty kind of profession, and to give a dash unto that
   spacious fancy and gilded nothing of a pretence to the love of God,
   disjoined or severed from that other branch of love, namely, that
   towards men. In speaking to this it will be requisite to do these three
   things, in order to the rendering this truth more capable of belief.

   I. To shew in what extent, or with what limitations, we are to
   understand this form of speech here in the text, the loving our
   brother.

   II. To shew whence it comes to pass, that any should take upon them to
   pretend love to God, who yet have no love to their brother. And

   III. To shew the absurdity and falsehood of that pretence. Upon which
   the use will ensue.

   I. It will be needful to consider a little in what extent, or with what
   limitation this form of speech is to be understood, namely the love of
   our brother: that is, how we are to under stand the expression, our
   brother; and what is meant by love, as it refers to him in this and
   other such like passages. 4

   I conceive we may very warrantably extend the meaning of this
   expression, as was formerly hinted to you in the first opening of the
   words, to such a latitude as to understand by it the duties of the
   second table; as love to God includes all the duties of the first. So
   our Saviour hath taught us to understand both these, in the answer
   which he gave to that querist, who asked him which was the great
   commandment of the law. The answer was this; "Thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
   mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like
   unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two
   commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Matt. xxii. 37. And
   the apostle you know also tells us, that "Love is the fulfilling of the
   law." Rom. xiii. 10. All is summoned up in this one word Love.

   And the same apostle in the very epistle from whence my text is taken,
   in insisting so much upon love to our brethren, as he doth throughout
   this epistle, guides us to his own drift and scope; and particularly
   when he tells us, that, "This is the love of God that we keep his
   commandments." 1 John v. 3. It is manifest, that sometimes in this
   epistle he intends by this expression, the love of God, not merely that
   love which terminates upon him as the Object of it, but that love which
   is from God, as the Author of it, divine love. And he speaks of this
   divine love indefinitely, and says it is the keeping of God's
   commandments; and of these commandments too we are to understand him
   speaking universally, and intimating that to love God is to keep all
   his commandments. It is love which runs forth in obedience to all his
   laws, which you know are divided into these two tables: the one is a
   comprehension of the precepts touching such things as relate to
   himself; the other of those which concern man. Therefore I doubt not
   but the word, brother, here in the text, may be taken in the same
   latitude, that neighbour is taken in, when it expresseth and signifieth
   to us the duties of a christian to his neighbour, as in that place
   before mentioned, "Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself," that is,
   any man. So that the duties that we owe to men, as men, are all to be
   collected and gathered up in this, as that great summary, namely, love,
   to our brother.

   It is very true indeed, brother is a title that many times in Scripture
   doth distinctly, and with some limitation hold forth to us a community
   and fraternity in religion; a brotherhood, who are in a state of
   subjection and devotedness to God, and are really his servants and
   children, as we shall have occasion further to speak by and by. But it
   is plain also, that it is some times used in Scripture in a far more
   extensive sense; as Adam in a, more extensive sense is said to be the
   son of God. You find it was part of the accusation against Job,
   (injurious enough no doubt, but that is nothing to our purpose) that he
   did take away the pledge from his brother, and made the poor naked, and
   sent them away unclothed. Job xxii. 6. And so you know Paul bespeaks
   all that great assembly before whom he was convened, and with whom he
   was disputing, after this manner, t( men and brethren;" though they
   were far from being all Christians as he was. Acts xxiii. 1.

   And I wish that there were not too much need to insist upon this
   business of love to our brother according to this latitude: that those
   were not many in our days, who make a very great shew of piety towards
   God, and hold forth an appearance of religion even in a more eminent
   degree; and yet indulge in themselves a very great liberty (most
   injuriously assumed God knows) as to their dispositions and deportment
   towards men as men, with whom they are cast into human society. Yea,
   and there hath been a way found out to make little of all matters of
   this nature: a way to depreciate and speak diminishingly of whatever is
   of that import, by affixing characters upon persons which it is
   intended should lessen them; as such a one is a good moral man, and the
   like. Truly, if it were only to assign to each man his proper place, or
   to determine that to be of less value and account which really is so,
   this were tolerable and very fit; but it is too manifest that very
   often religion is professedly magnified, not to the lessening only, but
   even the nullifying and exclusion of what is called morality. As if the
   tables were again to be broken, by being dashed one against another: or
   as if there were such incompatible things in the laws of God, that it
   is altogether impossible that a man should carry it as does become him
   towards men with whom he has to do, but he must intrench upon, and
   offer violence to the duty he owes to God; or, as if on the other hand,
   the duty which immediately terminates upon God, must quite shut out the
   world, and whatsoever relates to men as men.

   Though yet by the way too, it is to be noted, there is all the while a
   very great mistake and misapplication in the use of the term morality.
   And I wonder whence we or any of us have learned to appropriate moral
   to the duties of the second table; as if the duties of the first table
   were not as much moral, as those of the second, and in a higher and
   more eminent sense so. Certainly he is but a person of bad morality
   that does not love God, and whose heart is not set upon him as the
   best, the supreme Good. It is a great injury to take the term moral,
   and affix it only or chiefly to the duties of the second table. I hope
   there is such a thing, which ought to obtain in our notion and
   practice, as being well-mannered unto God, or behaving ourselves well
   and fitly towards him. And that is the meaning of morality, when a man
   is in general well-mannered. Therefore he that behaves himself ill to
   God, doth very ill deserve the character of a moral man.

   But the thing is, men intend civil by the term moral, and so mistake
   morality for civility. Civility indeed is only between men and men, as
   they are cast into societies one with another; but morality must needs
   run through the whole law of God. Every commandment of his law, which
   he hath distinguished from all other laws by vouchsafing himself to
   speak it by an audible voice, in ten words, to a vast assembly of men,
   we ought surely to account moral; and not elevate the authority or
   obligation of one part, by using terms with an intention to lessen or
   diminish another part of the same law.

   But as to the thing itself, waving the name, (as it is pity there
   should be so much logomachy, or contention about the use or
   misapplication of bare words) it is I say the thing itself, wherein the
   religion of Christians hath been so very deficient, and by which it
   hath been so much slured, that a great many have learned in their
   practice, not to care what their deportments are to men, so they can
   but keep up a continual profession of, and course of pretence to,
   sanctity, piety, and devotion towards God. And therefore the exigence
   of the case so much requiring it, and the text so plainly inviting to
   it also, it will be very fit to say somewhat of the duty of loving our
   brother in this latitude, as comprehensive of all the duty we owe to
   men as men. Though what I shall say at present will be in general. What
   is particular I shall refer to lie enlarged upon in the use or
   application. And here I must hint to you that a twofold extreme is
   carefully to be avoided, that when we speak in this latitude of loving
   our brother we do not,

   1. By that love to our brother so intend the inward principle of that
   love, as to cut off the external acts of it: Nor

   2. So confine the notion of this love to the external duties of the
   second table, as to exclude or shut out the internal principle. These
   are two extremes which men are very propense to run into, either into
   the one or the. other of them. On the one hand,

   1 Some are very apt to satisfy themselves that they are blameless, and
   not liable to exception, if their external deportment be fair and
   candid, just and equal, and also charitable now and then as occasion
   offers; though, in the mean time there be no such thing as the inward
   root and principle of this love in their hearts. It would be as great
   an absurdity for any one to say, that this love doth virtually include
   and comprehend in it all the external duties that flow from such a
   principle, as it would be to state those duties so abstractly, as to
   exclude the principle itself whence they are to proceed. They no way
   answer the intention and design of the Holy Ghost in this matter who
   only comply with the external part and letter of these laws, when, in
   the mean time, the spring and fountain of all these duties hath no
   place in the soul, namely love itself. For the external acts may
   proceed from another principle. A man may carry himself justly to
   others, for the sake of his reputation; and from the same motive may do
   many acts that carry in them mercy, pity and compassion to those that
   are in distress: but the principle from whence all this proceeds is
   self-love, and not love to his brother. Thus a man may do such and such
   an act of justice, such and such charitable actions, as the occasions
   of them are administered, merely because he would gain the reputation
   of being a most unexceptionable just man, a good-natured man, a
   charitable man. And many apprehend that they are greatly concerned to
   do so upon the account of prudence, out of a prudential respect, I say,
   to their own interest and advantage; such especially whose way of
   living in the world depends upon trade and commerce with men. They
   know, if they do not obtain and preserve the reputation of justice,
   none will have to do with them; every one will shun them; they will be
   thought unfit for any kind of commerce whatsoever. This is one extreme
   therefore that is carefully to be avoided in this matter. When we say
   that love to our brother includes all the duties of the second table,
   yet we must not say it excludes the inward principle whence those
   external duties flow; that is, such a love to our neighbour, as that
   which we bear, and owe unto ourselves, as we know our Lord resolves it,
   in the forementioned scripture. The other extreme is,

   2. That we lay not the whole stress of the business upon the internal
   principle, without the external acts and expressions: that is, that
   none should content themselves with the imagination and conceit, that
   they have in their own hearts and bosoms the principle of love to their
   brother; but in the mean while never express it nor let it be seen. No,
   that must be a great secret to themselves, and kept close in their own
   consciences; they have love in their breasts, but they can find no time
   or occasion to let it be seen: that is, they can, it may be, give him a
   good word, or as the apostle James expresses it, say to one in distress
   that wants food, or raiment, "Depart in peace, be you warmed and
   filled," but give them nothing for the body. They say that they pity
   such and such persons; and perhaps there may be some low degree of
   pity, but not such as exerts itself and commands the consonant act
   which is agreeable to compassion, and should be consequent or ought to
   follow there upon.

   But we must understand this duty of loving our brother so as to
   comprehend the internal principle, and external expressions of it
   together. It is necessary that there be a sincere love in the heart,
   and that it demonstrate its own sincerity by such expressions and
   discoveries, from time to time, as the providence of God gives us
   opportunity. As occasions offer we should, as the apostle exhorts, do
   good to all men, but especially to them who are of the household of
   faith. Gal. vi. 10.

   And if love to man is to be taken in such a latitude as hath been said,
   if it gather within the compass of it both the principle and all the
   actions that properly belong to it, we are not then to think we have a
   mean, low, ignoble object for our love. There is an image of God that
   man as man doth bear upon him. It is true, there is an image that hath
   been lost, but there is one still that is not capable of being so. The
   spiritual supernatural image wherein man did resemble God in holiness
   was banished from the nature of man universally, till he was pleased to
   renew it, and make us his own workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
   good works. But there is besides that a natural image of God, which man
   still bears, inasmuch as he partakes of a spiritual, intellectual
   nature, resembling that of God. So that it is a noble object of love we
   have. We are to love men, even as God's own offspring, his sons, as he
   is the Father of spirits. There is in every man a spiritual nature, of
   which God owns himself to be the great Parent and common Father.
   Therefore to have a heart universally inspired with love to men as men,
   which flows even as far as the nature of man reaches and extends
   itself, even to all mankind, this, I say, we must understand to be the
   sum of the duty given us in charge under the expression of love to our
   brother.

   We are to be lovers of mankind under one common notion; that is, to
   love upon a universal reason, which reaches to man as man, and so
   consequently to every man. "This is one of my own species whom I am
   required to love; of that rank and order in which God hath set me in
   the creation, and who all of us bear the image of the common Lord upon
   us." And you know it is the thing we find superadded, as the
   enforcement of one of the great precepts of the second table, namely
   "Thou shalt not kill;" and a reason why the breach and violation of it
   should be punished, that "in the image of God created he man." Gen. ix.
   6. Certainly the reason is the same as to all the other laws of that
   table. And besides what is appropriated to the conditions of some men
   by the very terms of this law itself, yet men as men, under that common
   notion, and for that very reason, are the objects of that required
   duty. As when we are forbidden to kill, is not every man whatever the
   object of that prohibition? When we are commanded not to steal, or bear
   false witness, are we not equally barred up from doing that injury to
   all mankind? When we are inhibited the coveting another man's property,
   is it not every man's property which we are thereby forbidden to covet?
   But then

   It must also be understood that there is a stricter notion of loving
   our brother, to which we are to have a more particular reference,
   without excluding that more common extensive notion (as there is no
   quarrel at all between things that are in subordination to one another)
   that is, we ought upon the Christian account, in a special
   distinguishing manner, to love those who under that notion are to be
   esteemed or reputed brethren: I mean Christians, in the truest and
   strictest sense, as far as they appear so to us; that is, those who are
   the regenerate sons of God, who are the children of one and the same
   Father, and therefore are brethren to one another, on that account.

   And you find that the apostle hath his eye to these brethrenhere, as It
   is manifest by many passages in this and the next epistles. If you
   consult the beginning of the next chapter, you will see who are to
   esteem one another as brethren in the most special sense. Whosoever
   believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is horn of God; and every one that
   loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten. 1 John v. 1.
   You see those are to be principally esteemed as brethren, who can look
   upon themselves and one another as related, upon the account of
   regeneration, unto the holy, blessed God as their common Father. So the
   notion of sons is manifestly taken in the third chapter of this epistle
   at the beginning; Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
   upon us, that we should be called the sons of God! 1 John iii. 1 Those,
   who are God's own sons by gratuitous adoption, are to be accounted by
   us as brethren, if we have any reason to look upon ourselves as of that
   character. Those who are sons by adoption, and there upon are entitled
   to the inheritance of sons, and are designed to that blessed state of
   the vision of God, and participation of his likeness, are characterized
   more eminently as his sons; which plainly tells us who are brethren to
   one another, and should, I say, be eyed and respected under that
   notion.

   But here we must take heed of narrowing and limiting the object any
   further. This is limiting and restraining it enough, we need not do it
   any more. Many will allow this measure, that we ought to love a godly
   man, or one that bears God's image as such; but they will after this be
   the measurers of their own measure, or they will cut God's measure
   according to the square of their own fancies. And when they have said
   they ought to love a godly man as such, that is every good man, they
   will have him to be of their own opinion in the smallest matters, one
   of their own persuasion and party, one of their own temper and humour.
   So that in short, upon the whole matter, that same Christian love, that
   ought to flow to all good men, to all Christians as such, is confounded
   with that which ought to be called the love of friendship.

   There is a vast difference between the love, which does, and ought to
   lie in common, between christians and christians, and that which should
   be particular, as between friends and friends. It is indeed true, if I
   were to design and choose out myself a friend, au intimate, one whom I
   would trust, and with him deposit my secrets and the like, I might
   warrantably enough make choice of one with those qualifications
   before-mentioned; that is, as near my own temper as possible, or of
   such a lovely, amiable temper as would render his friendship acceptable
   to me. I might choose one of as much prudence as I could, of my own
   rank and condition, whose ends, interests, and designs Jay very much
   the same way with my own. But it were a most unjust thing to think,
   that Christian love ought to be so confined. That must run to all
   christians as such, and under that very notion. So that it is not
   merely one of such a rank in the world, of such a temper and humour, of
   such or such a party, holding certain opinions in smaller and more
   disputable matters, that is the character of one who is to be loved as
   a christian.

   Though indeed that has all along been in all times, and among all sorts
   of persons pretending to religion, a very usual practice, to fix the
   church, and set the boundaries of God's house, just according to the
   measure of their own fancy, and of their own persuasion. So the
   romanists will pretend to have the church only among those of their
   communion. And so we know there are others also, who would so confine
   the pale of the church. Besides, of others among ourselves there are
   not a few, who will allow none to be of the church but who will bear
   such external badges. One may as truly judge of a man by his clothes
   and garb of what profession or calling he is, and we may as well
   confine all human love and commerce to persons of such and such a
   complexion, as Christian love and converse to men distinguished only by
   certain external adjuncts. But I shall not here insist further on the
   extent and limitation of this form of speech, loving our brother. When
   we come to the use there will be occasion to say more on this head.

   II. We are next to inquire, whence it is that any should pretend love
   to God, and yet be destitute of Christian, or even human love to their
   brethren. We have formerly shewed you, that the exercise of love to God
   is a thing of far higher difficulty than that which terminates on men.
   Love to an unseen God is unspeakably more difficult in the exercise of
   it than towards men that we see, and have occasion to converse with
   daily. Now though this be most true and apparent, yet the pretence of
   love to God is much more easy than the real exercise of love to our,
   brother. It is a far more difficult thing to love God, than our
   brother; but withal it is a far more easy thing to pretend love to God,
   than really to exert it to our brother. We have in, the one the real
   exercise of love, and in the other case only the pretence to it. And
   there are two things particularly that do much more facilitate this
   business of men's making a shew, and putting on the pretence of love to
   God, rather than really exercising it to men.

   1 That it is more cheap, and less expensive. And

   2. It is more glorious, and makes a more glittering shew than the other
   does; therefore men are a great deal more apt, and more easily induced
   to it.

   1. It is more cheap to pretend love to God, than really to exercise
   love to our brother. It will cost them less. The things by which men
   acquire to themselves a reputation of love to God, may stand them in
   little; only to be at some small pains to get notions into their minds,
   by which they may be furnished with talk upon such and such subjects.
   They are not one straw the poorer for this, it costs them nothing.
   Their keeping up the external duties of religion, going from time to
   time to Christian assemblies, waiting as much as they can upon the
   ordinances of God; all this may be done, and they be at no expence.
   There may be little or no cost in all this. But really to exercise love
   to our brother, will many times prove a costly thing, A man must deny
   himself, his own interest, gain, and advantage very often, that so he
   may be just or merciful as the circumstances of the case may be.

   And it is plain, the great temptations that men have to encroach upon
   the rights of other men, and intrench upon the businesses that come
   within this summary of love to our neighbour, are principally from
   self-love, and self-interest. Men would be just if they did not find or
   imagine, that they should gain by this or that trick, by putting this
   and that cheat and fraud upon their neighbours with whom they have to
   do. They would be charitable if it did not cost them much, if they were
   to expend nothing. And thus to pretend love to God is a cheap thing:
   but to exercise real love to our neighbour according as various
   occasions may be, to draw forth the principle into act and exercise,
   may frequently prove very costly and expensive.

   2. There is also more of glory in the shew, and glittering in the
   appearance of religion (in sometimes more than others, and it may be in
   our times as much as any) than there is in the discharge of the duties
   of justice and charity to men. He that acquires to himself the
   reputation of a godly man, by an ability to discourse of godly matters,
   having gotten a great stock of notional knowledge, gains thereby also
   the reputation of a man of a very refined mind. As the gnosticks in
   their age, an age of errors, were men of much pretence; had very high
   and sublime notions; but as to their morals they were as bad men as
   ever the world knew, if you will take the testimony concerning them,
   not from their professed enemies the Christians, who opposed themselves
   to them, but even from a heathen who characterized! them at large.
   (Plotinus) There were not a viler sort of men, as to matters concerning
   the duties of the second table, and what lay between man and man. But
   they were men of high speculative knowledge, had very airy, and sublime
   notions, wherewith they did seduce and captivate not a few A great
   reputation was acquired by them of that kind, when they could recommend
   themselves as persons, who had made it their business to separate from
   the rest of the world, to give themselves up to the study of all wisdom
   as the wise man's expression is. Eccles. vii. 25.

   And as those men looked big and talked high in those former ages upon
   this account, I mean the reputation they had acquired for their
   knowledge and wisdom, which they boasted of; so many do now, and think
   to make a glitter in the places where they live, as men of high,
   notional knowledge in matters of religion: but in comparison of this
   they think that to do good in a place where a man lives, to be a useful
   member of a civil, or a christian society, to observe the strict rules
   of justice, charity, and compassion, are mean things and very low
   matters, compared with that glorious shew and glitter, which the
   appearance of a great measure of notional, speculative knowledge casts
   upon men in their own eyes, and the eyes of them that are about them.
   Thus knowledge puffeth up, while true love would edify. But in the mean
   time that which so puffeth up makes a better shew, than that which does
   substantially, and solidly edify the soul.

   It is too apparent a truth, which hath been hinted to you thus far,
   that there are persons, who upon such accounts as these, are easily
   induced to pretend to religion, and to make a shew of love, and
   devotedness to God, who are strangers to the effects of love to their
   brother. But from this so very apparent truth men are apt to induce as
   manifest and gross a falsehood; that is, because there are those who
   pretend love to God, that are found manifestly peccant as to the
   exercise of that duty which love to man would command, and ought to be
   the spring and principle of, that therefore all pretences to stricter
   religion than ordinary are hypocritical. No man who makes a more strict
   profession than his neighbours, and is more frequently conversant in
   the exercises of religion than they are, but he must needs be a
   pharisee and a mere pretender, only be cause some such persons are
   manifestly capable of being convinced as such. But this is no more
   reasonable, than because there is some counterfeit coin in the world,
   that therefore all is to be rejected as false, and not current; or
   because spectres and ghosts have been seen to walk in human shape,
   therefore there axe no true men; or as if, because some do
   hypocritically pretend loyalty and devotedness to the government, while
   they carry on conspiracies against their rulers, that therefore there
   is no way for others to approve themselves blameless, but presently to
   turn open and contemptuous rebels. This is strange kind of logic!

   And in truth, none are honest men in their account, but such as will
   swear, and drink, and run into all wickedness and excess of riot with
   them. Of such a one they will be ready to say, "A very honest
   gentleman!" and then all the talk flies against such and such persons
   that addict themselves to a course of religion. And if some who are the
   notorious scandals of it have shewn themselves to be what they are,
   then those who make it their business to keep up a course of strictness
   in piety and religion, have the common infamous brand of hypocrites put
   upon them.

   Now at this rate we must certainly quite turn the tables. Virtue must
   be called vice, and vice be called virtue, and the names of things be
   utterly altered. And we must account, that God's children and the
   devil's are to change families, fathers, and states one with another.
   For we shall have none left to be called honest men, or the children of
   God, but such as are no better than good -fellows: and all serious
   fearers and sincere lovers of God must be abandoned for none of his,
   only because some false brethren creep in among them.

   And yet it very greatly concerneth those, who are actually and truly of
   the family and household, or the church of God by faith in Jesus
   Christ, though men do never so causelessly and injuriously scandalize
   the whole fraternity, upon the delinquencies of some false pretenders,
   to learn instruction by it, and to be abundantly more wary in all
   manner of conversation, upon the account of their calling him Father.
   All therefore that I shall by way of use leave with you at this time is
   the ad monition of the apostle, If ye call upon the Father, who without
   respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time
   of your sojourning in fear. 1 Pet. i.17.

SERMON XIV. [70]

   WE are endeavouring to shew you, that their pretence to the love of God
   is both untrue and absurd, who love not their brother. And as to this
   we proposed to shew in, the

   I. Place, how we are to understand the duty of loving our brother; that
   is, in what extent and latitude, and also with what restriction and
   limitation.

   II. Whence it is that persons pretend to the love of God, who never
   loved their brother. We now proceed,

   III. To shew the falsehood and absurdity of that pretence; or to evince
   to you, that the pretence of love to God, where there is no love to our
   brother, is both false and absurd. That it is false is expressly enough
   said in this very verse, and we need go no further for the proof of it.
   "If a man say he loveth God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar."
   What need we more to prove this pretence false? That it is also absurd,
   is to be evinced to you from the considerations we shall give you for
   that purpose, which are especially two: namely, the necessary connexion
   that there is between the love of God, and the love of our brother, in
   the nature of things; and the greater difficulty of loving God whom we
   have not seen, than our brother whom we have seen. So that it is absurd
   for a man to pretend, that he has mastered the greater difficulty, who
   has not overcome the less.

   1 The absurdity of this pretence may be evinced from the necessary
   strict connexion there is between the love of God, and the love of our
   brother, even in the nature of the things themselves. And here we shall
   shew you that there is a four fold connexion between them--they are
   connected in respect of their object--in respect of their root and
   principle--in respect of their rule, and--of their end.

   (1.) They are connected in respect of their object. Love to God and
   love to our brother, will be found to have in some sort the same
   object. I would not go about to prove any great affinity between the
   things themselves, but it is plain, I say, they have in some sort the
   same formal object. That is, our love to our brother if it be right and
   true, falls in with our love of God; so as that our love of God must be
   the very formal reason of our loving our brother, whom we can never
   truly love, if we do not love him for God's sake and because we
   primarily love God.

   The truth is, whatever specimens of beauty or excellence we find any
   where in the creature, we are then only said to love them duly, when
   our love is pitched upon them as so many rays and beams from the first
   and supreme Good. And so it is the original primary Goodness which we
   rightfully love, even in this or that creature. It is true indeed,
   goodness in its original, and in its descent and derivation are not
   univocally the same. Nothing can be univocally common to God and the
   creature. But they are analogically the same. Goodness is primarily in
   God, and so descends, and is imparted to this or that creature. But it
   is only there by dependance upon him, from whom and in whom it
   originally is. And our love to our brother, in the strictest sense of
   that expression, is exerted, when it meets with that goodness, which is
   the most express and vivid image of God's own. We there love the
   representation of God in that subject wherein he has proposed himself
   to us as our pattern, even the excellency and glory of his holiness.

   They that are in the strictest sense our brethren, as you have heard,
   are God's own regenerate sons; and because v&gt;e are to love him that
   begat, we are to love them that are begotten of him. 1 John v. 1. And
   it is therefore to be observed, that elsewhere in this epistle, our
   states Godward are to be measured by this one thing, namely, our love
   to the brethren. "We know that we have passed from death unto life,
   because we love the brethren." 1 John iii. 14. So that if we compare
   place with place, it is very plain that the measure here is but mensura
   mensurata; that is, it is itself to be measured by a supreme measure,
   namely, our love to God. It is a mark or character, which itself is
   tried by a higher mark. "By this," says the apostle, "we know that we
   love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments."
   1 John v. 2. So that no man may depend further upon this as a mark and
   trial of his state with respect to God, that he loves such and such his
   children, than as he is able to evince the love of them to be for God's
   own sake, and as they bear his image and likeness. And so the trial
   finally and ultimately resolves in this, "Am I a lover of God, yea or
   no?"

   It is very true, that I may first and more sensibly have the perception
   perhaps of my love to this or that particular man. But I must run the
   matter higher, and particularly inquire, what is the reason I love this
   man? Is it because he is a good man? taking goodness in the strictest
   and most noble sense. Is it because he hath participated of the divine
   goodness? and is a follower, imitator, representer of God's moral
   goodness, which is his holiness? We must be capable of concluding
   ourselves lovers of our brethren, as they are holy ones, as they bear,
   or appear to us to bear, the image of God. And hereby, and not
   otherwise, can we conclude our love to our brother to be of the right
   kind, by our being able to evince that we love God primarily and above
   him, that is, that we love him for God's sake. And whatever is to be
   said of any thing for such a reason, and only upon that account, is
   much more to be said of that reason itself. We do not therefore love
   our brother aright, if God be not loved much more; our love to God
   being the very reason, why we truly and aright do love our brother.

   Thus they stand connected in their object. You see they cannot be
   severed; and that a man cannot possibly love his brother aright, if he
   love not God: therefore the love of God must needs draw in the love of
   our brother, as a thing in separably connected with it.

   (2.) They are connected also in the root and principle, which in both
   is one and the same; namely, that very spirit of love, which is
   mentioned by Paul to Timothy, and which God has given us, as well as
   that of power, and of a sound mind. 2 Tim. i. 7. We must know that love
   to our brother is a fruit of the Spirit as well as love to God. We have
   an enumeration of the several fruits of the Spirit in the epistle to
   the Galatians, "and love is set in the front of them all." Gal. v. 22.
   Now if you consider what fruits of the flesh those of the Spirit do
   stand in opposition to, you will find yourselves necessitated to admit
   and conclude, that love there, is not meant of love to God alone, but
   of that love which diffuses and spreads itself duly according as the
   objects are presented or do invite; in which the divine goodness is
   found, in himself primarily, and derived to this or that creature, and
   especially to such as bear, as was said, the more lively image and
   representation of his goodness.

   We are not therefore to think, that love to God is one gracious
   principle, and love to our brother is another gracious principle: but
   we must know, that it is one and the same gracious principle of holy
   love which works towards this or that object, according to the
   excellency and amiableness thereof; that is, proportionably to what I
   see of divine goodness in it, which is the formal reason of my love.
   Holy love is the affection of love sanctified; which affection is not
   many but one, but yet turns itself towards this or that object
   according as the object claims and requires.

   And therefore we find expressly that love to our brethren is resolved
   into the spirit of holiness, as its original cause, which is the thing
   that I would mainly, and principally inculcate, that so it may not be
   looked upon as a thing of an inferior nature; since we are too apt to
   look with a diminishing eye upon this duty of love to our brethren. It
   is really one of the fruits of the Spirit of holiness, a part of its
   production in renewed souls. See how expressly the apostle Peter speaks
   to this purpose. "Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the
   truth through the Spirit, unto unfeigned love of the brethren; see that
   ye love one another with a pure heart fervently." 1 Pet. i. 22. So
   again we are told, that "the end of the commandment is charity (or
   love, for it is the same word that is rendered sometimes one way and
   sometimes another) out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and
   of faith unfeigned." 1 Tim. i. 5. By the end of the commandment is
   meant the perfection, the top, the sum of it; or that which does
   virtually include all that lieth within the whole compass of the
   commandment. And what we are to understand by the word commandment,
   which is expressed indefinitely, we may see in what follows; namely,
   that it is the same thing with the law, "The law," says the apostle,
   "is not made for a righteous man; but for the lawless and disobedient,
   for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, &c." ver.
   9. which supposes the commandment and law here to be meant of the law
   in its extent, as it comprehends both tables; not only our duty to God,
   but to our brother also. And therefore that love which is the coronis
   and very sum of it, goes to both. Now it is said concerning this love,
   taken thus extensively, that it must proceed out of a pure heart, and
   faith unfeigned. It must proceed from that faith, which is peculiar to
   the regenerate sons of God. "They that believe are born of God." 1 John
   v. 1. "And as many as received him to them gave he power to be come the
   sons of God, even to them that believe in his name; which were born not
   of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
   God." John i. 12, 13. Now this same faith is the immediate production
   of the Spirit in the work of regeneration. It works out into love, and
   even into that love, which exercises itself upon our brother. Love to
   him, I say, must proceed from faith unfeigned. Therefore when the
   exercise of love was required by our Saviour, in forgiving an offending
   brother; and the question was put, how often they should forgive? and
   he replies, "unto seventy times seven;" presently the disciples, as
   knowing the great need and exigency of the case, said, "Lord increase
   our faith." Luke xvii. 5. There needs much faith in order to the
   exercise of such love.

   Wherefore this love is in most necessary connexion with what is
   intimate to the new creature, and what most essentially belongs unto
   the constitution of it. It is part of the work of regeneration, and of
   that holy creature, which is, when produced, called the new creature.
   You find therefore in that scripture, 2 Pet. i. 5, 6, 7. where several
   graces of the Spirit are mentioned together, that brotherly kindness
   comes among the rest, in conjunction with faith, patience, and the
   like.

   Yea, and to evince this a little further, you find that in this very
   epistle in which is our text, love to our brother, even an indigent
   brother, is called by the name of love to God; that is, not with
   reference to him considered as the object (though in some respects, as
   was said before, God may be considered as the object too) but in
   reference to him as the Original and Author of this love. "He that hath
   this world's good," saith the apostle, "and seeth his brother have
   need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth
   the love of God in him?" 1 John iii. 17. It is as if he had said, it is
   plain, that this divine love, which God is the Author of, and of which
   this poor indigent brother is an object, is not in him, if he has no
   bowels of compassion towards him at such a time, when the exigency of
   his case calls for relief.

   The apostle Paul tells the Thessalonian christians, that concerning
   brotherly love they needed not that he should write unto them, "for
   (saith he) you yourselves are taught of God to love one another." 1
   Thess. iv. 9. Sure we are not strangers to the import of that
   expression in Scripture, or what it is to be taught of God. The
   expression is paralleled by those which represent men as drawn by him,
   efficaciously moved, and acted by his almighty Spirit. "Every one,"
   saith our Saviour, "that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh
   unto me." John vi. 45. That hearing and learning of the Father, is
   expounded by that of being drawn, or powerfully attracted by the
   Father. Therefore the meaning of this expression, "You have been taught
   of God," is this; your hearts have been powerfully drawn by God into
   the exercise of this love to one another. "You need not that I write to
   you concerning this matter, for ye are taught of God." As in another
   case it is said, (the passage is taken from the prophet Jeremiah xxxi.
   34.) "They shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his
   brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to
   the greatest." Heb. viii. 11. The same form of expression you see is
   used here, and must be taken in the same sense.

   In the second chapter of the same epistle of John, ver. 20. we read of
   an unction of the Holy Ghost, by which the spirits of those who belong
   to God are so seasoned, and tinctured, that they are even
   connaturalized unto the truth; and this is the way of God's teaching,
   even to love, as well as any thing else. It is a mighty, potent work of
   that Spirit of holiness, by which men are taught to love. He teaches so
   as none besides does. His way of teaching is by working in us the
   things that we are taught. And therefore they who think that whatsoever
   is required of goodness and holiness, may be the product only of human
   endeavour and acquisition, are to understand that we cannot do so much
   as this, without being taught so to do by the mighty power and Spirit
   of God; not so much, I say, as truly to love men as such, upon whom the
   stamp and impression of God's holy image is to be found. And indeed,
   they who think that all may be the effect of our own endeavour which is
   herein required of us, or of moral suasion, might learn better
   Christianity even from some heathens of Plato's school. A heathen
   philosopher, I remember, in one of his dialogues discusses this
   question, Whether virtue is to be taught or not? And he undertakes to
   demonstrate, that it is not a thing to be taught, but is infused, or
   inspired by God himself. Particularly he says as to this virtue of
   love, love to good men, that it is a divine thing infused by God. And
   he gives the reason of this general assertion, namely, that whatsoever
   virtue any do partake of, it is not taught by men, but infused from
   heaven above: "For, (saith he,) if it were a thing to be got by mere
   human teaching, then certainly good men might easily teach others to be
   good and virtuous; and only they must do it, be cause they alone have
   virtue, and so are alone capable of teaching it. But if they were
   capable of teaching it to others, nothing could hinder it but their
   envy and ill-nature; or unwillingness that any should fare as well as
   themselves. But a good man cannot be envious. Therefore (he concludes
   upon the whole) virtue is a thing not to be taught, a thing that cannot
   be got by teaching." We see then how it is to be understood, when love,
   which is so great a part of it, is said to be taught of God. So that
   love to God and the brethren agree in their root and principle. They
   have there a firm connexion; so as that it is impossible they should be
   severed, or that a man can be a lover of God who is not a lover of his
   brother.

   (3.) They are connected also in their rule, which is one and the same
   law: for indeed the whole law of God is summed up in love. "Love is the
   fulfilling of the law," as we had occasion to shew formerly. Rom. xiii.
   10. And you see what the apostle means there by law, from the occasion
   of this discourse. "And this commandment have we from him, that he that
   loveth God, should love his brother also." 1 John iv. 21. He hath laid
   this law upon us, that we should thus dispense our love; that if we
   pretend to exercise our love to him, we must do it to our brother too.
   He will never otherwise take us into the census, or account, of lovers
   of himself.

   And when the apostle James insists upon it, that "Whosoever shall keep
   the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all," pray
   look back there, and see upon what occasion, and with what reference he
   says this. "If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the Scripture,
   Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well. But if ye have
   respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as
   transgressors." James ii. 8, 10. You find he has reference to this very
   thing, our love to our brother; which is what he calls the royal law.
   The law enjoined us is this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself." And if we be found peccant as to this, and obey it not, nor
   comply with the authority of the law and the Lawgiver in this instance,
   we make ourselves rebels throughout; we break the whole law, and all
   that we do besides signifies nothing. Therefore he gives an instance.
   The same law that hath said, "Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
   kill." ver. 11. The law doth equally and alike forbidinordinate love
   and unjust hatred: inordinate lust and impure love, as that which
   offends against one command; and inordinate hatred and ill-nature which
   equally offends against the other, as it is the root of murder. In
   opposition to which this law stands, as the summary of all that duty,
   which we must under stand to be implicitly enjoined in that law.

   (4.) Love to God, and our brother concentre and agree in one end; that
   is, the glory of God, and our own felicity: which two, you know, do
   make up the end of man. We ought to love God, in order to our
   glorifying him; and we ought also to love our brother, for the same
   reason. So we ought to love God in order to our enjoying him, and being
   happy and blessed in him; and in like manner ought we to love our
   brother, in order to our enjoying God, and being happy and blessed in
   him.

   The glory of God first depends upon our loving him, but it also as
   truly depends upon our loving our brother. Yea this glory of God which
   is the end, and some way ought to be the effect of our actions, shines
   a great deal more, sometimes, in the exercise of love to men. Thus
   saith David, "My Goodness extendeth not unto thee, but unto the saints,
   that are upon the earth, in whom is all my delight." Ps. xvi. 2, 3. As
   if he had said, Thou art never the better for it, but they may be. Here
   it is that we make the glory of God to shine forth in our course and
   practice when we do visibly exemplify the goodness of his nature in our
   own goodness, that is, in doing good; in those continual fruits and
   acts of goodness, which issue and flow from the principle of divine
   love (with which our souls are possessed) to those that are related
   unto God, according as their relation to him is larger or more special,
   as we have formerly shewed.

   It is by our doing good that we shew to whom we belong, though that
   goodness of ours can reach only to men and saints. "The fruit of the
   Spirit is in all goodness:" (Eph. v. 9.) namely, that goodness which
   can flow and diffuse itself according as we have objects here below,
   upon which it may be continually pouring itself forth, and spreading
   itself. Herein we bear testimony to God, that we are the very children
   of his love. We do, as it were, herein justify and honour our great
   Father. We own our Father, and own ourselves his children. "Love, that
   ye may be the children of God, says our Saviour, who doth good both to
   the evil and the good;" that is, that ye may appear to be his children.
   Matt. v. 44, 45. And again, "By this shall all men know that ye are my
   disciples, if ye love one another." John xiii. 35. This refers to that
   more special love which we ought to settle upon nobody but those, who
   are particularly related and united to Christ. "You will own me in the
   world, and your relation to me; and I shall be owned and honoured among
   men by you, if ye love one another." And this was the character of
   Christians in the primitive times of the Christian church, "See how
   these Christians love one another, and refuse not to die for one
   another."

   Yea, and again, our own felicity is promoted (which is another part of
   our end) by the love of our brother. For though God himself be the
   supreme felicitating object, yet he intends to be enjoyed by his in a
   community. He gathers them all unto himself in one body, of which body
   love is the common, bond, the unitive thing which as it were embodies
   and holds the members together; being the same bond of perfectness the
   apostle speaks of, or the most perfect bond which, says he, is charity.
   Col. iii. 14.

   And the case is plain and manifest, that where there is a languor and
   deficiency of Christian or brotherly love, the way of access to God is
   obstructed and barred up. Such persons have no free converse with God.
   A spirit that is full of rancour, under a distemper, filled with
   animosity though but to this or that one particular person, knows not
   how to go to God. The new creature is starved and famished this way.
   The soul cannot heartily enjoy God, hath no liberty towards God.
   Therefore our Saviour considering the state of the case gives this
   general law and rule: "If thou bring thy gift to the altar (he speaks
   in the phrase and language of the Jews under the Old Testament
   administration, designing the instruction of christians under the New)
   and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; leave
   there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way (thou hast nothing to
   do at the altar, there can be no commerce between God and thee except
   thou go) and be reconciled first to thy brother, and then come and
   offer thy gift." Matt. v. 23, 24. Love must flow, and have a free
   course between thy brother and thee, or it can have none between God
   and thee. And if it were possible how monstrous would it be, if in a
   man's natural body all the nutriment should be drawn to one side! Would
   any one think fit to feed and cherish but one side of himself?
   Especially, would the new creature cherish only a love to God, and at
   the same time famish what may be called the other side, a love to his
   brother? He attempts a thing impossible to be done; and it were
   extremely monstrous if it could be done, or should ever take place.

   Thus far you see then, that by an inseparable connexion which there is,
   in these four respects, between love to God and love to our brother, it
   must needs be an absurd pretence that men make of love to God, who
   exercise not love to their brother also.

   2. I proceed to speak briefly (and so shall shut up for the present) to
   a further consideration, whence the absurdity of such a pretence
   ariseth; which is drawn from the greater difficulty of loving God whom
   we have not seen, than our brother whom we have seen. It must needs be
   an absurd thing for a man to pretend that he hath mastered the greater
   difficulty, who hath not overcome the less. Which you see is the plain
   and full sense and meaning of the apostle's reasoning here.

   But here it may perhaps be said, that "These two considerations do seem
   to contradict one another, or that the latter is repugnant to the
   former. For if love to God and to our brother be so connected as hath
   been shewn, then how can it be that love to our brother should be less
   difficult than love to God? Yea and if there be such a connexion, as it
   appears there is, it may rather be said that love to our brother seems
   more difficult: for we can never truly love him, till we have first
   been brought to love God; and so we love our brother secondarily, that
   is, upon his account and for his sake." For the clearing of this I
   shall briefly say two or three things to you.

   (I.) That when we say, love to God is more difficult than love to our
   brother, we speak not (as formerly you may have taken notice) of
   implanting the principle of this love; but we speak of the exercise of
   it. It is God that implants the principle, and all things are equally
   easy to him; but it is we that are to exercise it.

   (2.) Whereas we cannot exercise it neither without his concurrence, we
   are to consider that concurrence of his with reference not to his
   absolute, but to his ordinary power. Not, I say, according to the
   extraordinary, but the ordinary workings of the power of God. And
   though it be true, that according to the extraordinary working of his
   power he can make it equally facile to love himself and any creature in
   which his image shines, and more facile or easy many times; yet
   according to his ordinary working, his people find by their own sad
   experience, that they have more to do in getting their hearts to act
   that way, than towards the creature, according to that degree of divine
   goodness which they can take notice of. But though this be clear
   enough, yet we answer further.

   (3.) There are many persons, who in some degree love Christians and
   good men upon lower and less sufficient motives; and not upon the
   account of what peculiarly respects godly men as such. And we are
   principally to understand the apostle as speaking to such persons, as
   pretended to love their brethren, professed Christians, upon these
   lower motives. As if he had said, "You are not yet arrived so far as to
   love your brother upon motives sufficient to establish your love,
   though you see him as one, with whom you have sensible converse. Are
   you then got so high as to love God? Is it a credible thing you should
   be able to love an unseen God?" So that the pretence carries the same
   absurdity with it, as if one should pretend this or that more difficult
   thing to be easy and facile, when many things that are unspeakably more
   easy he cannot do or effect. As if a man should pretend it easy to fly
   to the stars, who cannot walk upright on his feet. Or as if another
   were vaunting to be able to outface the sun, whose eyes are perpetually
   dazzled with the light of a candle. A likely thing you should love God,
   whom you have not seen; who cannot so much as love your brother, whom
   you have seen, but upon the lowest motives! Wherefore these things have
   a connexion, and it appears from these considerations, that true love
   to our brother must be inseparable from the love of God. And so we have
   sufficiently seen the falsehood, and absurdity of such a pretence as
   this is.

   The Use of all remains; and for the present it concerns us to bethink
   ourselves and reflect, that whereas all of us profess and pretend to
   love God (I presume there are none here but will avow themselves to be
   lovers of God, for to profess any religion is virtually to profess love
   to God; I say, we are concerned to bethink) whether our want of love to
   our brother carries not in it a conviction of the falsehood of that
   pretence. The languishing of this love shews a deficiency of the
   exercise of that noble principle of love to God. Love to God cannot be
   fervent, when love to Christians is so cool and feeble. And we have not
   only reason to complain that love is cold, but that envy and hatred are
   flagrant and burning hot. So far from loving one another are Christians
   now-a-days, that they cannot endure one another, nor tell how to live
   by one another!

SERMON XV. [71]

   THE truth which we have in hand from these words, I mean the last of
   those which have been proposed from them, is to this purpose; That
   their pretence to the love of God is both false and absurd, who join
   not therewith love to their brother. And here

   I. We have already shewn, in speaking to this proposition, how we are
   to understand love to our brother; with what latitude, and with what
   limitations.

   II. We have shewn you whence it is that some may pretend to love God,
   who do not love their brother. And

   III. We have shewn both the falsehood and absurdity of such a pretence:
   the former from plain words of Scripture; and the latter from such
   considerations, as do plainly demonstrate it to be a most unreasonable
   pretence, and therefore such as carries the most manifest absurdity
   with it.

   The Use doth yet remain. And that which I more principally intend is to
   put you upon reflection: to engage you to reflect upon yourselves, and
   the common practice, but more especially upon your own; to consider how
   disagreeable it is to that love, which we owe to our brother; that so
   we may lament the great miscarriage that is to be seen in the common
   practice of the world, and reform it in ourselves.

   And consider as to both, since we all of us profess love to God (as all
   implicitly do who profess any thing of religion, of which love to God
   is the very life and soul) whether want of love to our brother doth not
   too generally carry with it a plain confutation of that profession. And
   that I may the more distinctly pursue this use, and more
   comprehensively, as to the cases and persons concerned, I shall,
   according to the double notion of the duty in the text, take notice how
   little love there is to be seen towards men as men, or towards
   christians as christians.

   First, Towards men as men: whom we may consider either universally,
   that is all men in general; or indefinitely, that is any man in
   particular with whom we have to do, or have occasion to converse
   withal.

   I. How little love is there to be seen towards men universally
   considered! To love men as men, is to love them upon a universal
   reason, that extendeth or should make our love extend unto all men. As
   you know all the commandments of the second table are all founded in
   love, resolved into that duty, and gathered up into that one sum. And
   we find that this or that particular command being reduced thither doth
   oblige us to duty even to men as men, and that upon a universal reason
   common to all men. As we instanced before in that one negative precept,
   "Thou shall not kill," enforced by that universal reason, "For in the
   image of God made he man." The obligation of this in reference to the
   object, extends as far even as that natural image of God does; which as
   an ancient speaks, "every man bears whether he will or no, and can no
   more part with it than with himself." It is indeed his very nature. But
   how little of such love is there to be found among us! How few true
   lovers are there even of their own species, who have a real and fervent
   affection (such as the object claims and challenges) for such as
   partake of the human nature with themselves! For I pray consider

   1. How little is our resentment of the common calamities of the world,
   whether in reference to their eternal, or temporal concernments! How
   few regret it, or take it deeply to heart, that men are so generally
   without God in the world, and without Christ! That the knowledge is so
   imperfect among men of their own original, and of the end of their
   being; of him who made them, and what they were made for! That the
   knowledge of a Redeemer (the sweet savour of which the apostle tells as
   it was so much his ambition to have manifested in every place, 2 Cor.
   ii. 14.) is yet so little among men! Who regrets or lays it to heart,
   that the world is so filled with violence, barbarism and blood? that a
   deluge and inundation of misery is with sin spread over the world, and
   transmitted and propagated from age to age, and from generation to
   generation? When we hear of wars and devastations, and garments rolled
   in blood here and there, how few are there who concern themselves for
   it, as long as they are quiet and at peace in their own habitations!
   And again,

   2. How cold and faint arc our supplications on the behalf of men so
   generally considered! though we are expressly directed by the
   exhortation of the apostle to make prayer and supplication for all men.
   1 Tim. ii. 1. How little comprehensive are our spirits to take in the
   common concerns of the world with seriousness as the case requires! How
   little do we imitate the blessed God in this! for a general
   philanthropy, or kindness to men is even a most godlike quality, and
   that wherein he hath represented himself as a pattern to us. And

   II. We may consider men indefinitely, that is, any whom we have to do
   or converse with. And though there may be, as there ought to be the
   inward workings of love towards men considered under that formal and
   extensive notion, yet there may not be so much as the external
   expressions and exercises of love to men considered this latter way.
   This external exercise of love requires a present object, determined by
   such circumstances, and such particular occurrences and occasions as
   render it liable to the exercise of our love. So the apostle limits
   particularly our benefaction; "As we have opportunity let us do good
   unto all men, but especially to those who are of the household of
   faith. Gal. vi. 10. The poor, says our Saviour, ye have always with
   you, but me you have not." John xii. 8. A present object so
   circumstanced, is required for the exercise of such love as goes forth
   into external acts. We cannot ourselves actually do good unto all. We
   cannot reach all, for our sphere is not so large. The most we can do in
   that kind is by prayer to our utmost to engage a universal agent, who
   can adapt himself to every one's case and exigence. But within our
   sphere; I say, and in reference to those we have to do with and where
   we have opportunity, how little does there appear of love to men!

   The rule according to which we are to exercise our love, is that royal
   law, as the apostle James calls it, to love our neighbour as ourselves,
   Jam. xi. 8. Or as our Saviour elsewhere expresses it, "Whatsoever ye
   would that men should do to you, do ye so to them." Matt. vii. 12. A
   rule that hath been very highly magnified even among some of the
   heathen; and the Author of it also, our Lord Jesus Christ himself, upon
   the account of it. That is a known thing of the emperor Alexander
   Severus, who caused it to be inscribed up and down in the most noted
   places of his palace; and professed to bear so high an honour unto
   Christ, upon the account of his being the Author of so good a rule, as
   to desire to have him placed among the other deities. This indeed was
   designed before, but providence ordered it so as that it should not be
   said he came into so mean a copartnership for a Deity.

   And that rule it is" plain doth oblige us in reference to men
   indefinitely, or to any man whatsoever. For we would not only wish that
   this or that good man should deal well with us, or regret he should
   deal ill, but that any. man whatsoever should do so. We take it ill to
   be traduced, detracted, oppressed by any man. And so we have the object
   of our love in that extent plainly pointed out to us. Now we might here
   shew you, how this royal law is violated: namely, by such carriages and
   dispositions as are directly repugnant to love; or else by such a
   temper, disposition, and behaviour, which (though it doth not carry in
   it repugnancy to love, but would consist very well with it) proceeds
   from other principles, and not from a genuine, and pure principle of
   love. And here

   1. We shall animadvert upon some things which are more directly
   repugnant to this love. As

   (1.) A morose unconversable frame and temper. When men are become
   unsociable, and nobody knows how to deal with them; such sons of Belial
   (as was said concerning Nabal) that one knows not how to speak to them.
   Such as, al though it has been a proverb that every man hath two
   handles, have themselves never a one that one can tell how to take hold
   of them by. It is impossible to, know how to converse with them, so as
   not to give them offence; always sour, captious, snarling,
   supercilious, and tractable on no terms. And this is a great deal more
   odious when religion is pretended for it; and when because they would
   be taken for persons more strictly and severally godly, they must needs
   therefore in their great zeal for such a reputation shew themselves
   uncivil and humoursome. As if religion, which beyond all things else
   tends to cultivate men's minds and manners, must quite destroy humanity
   out of the world, and render men incapable of civil converse.

   If we did but read and consider such passages of Scripture, where we
   are enjoined to be courteous, and kindly affected to men; or consider
   such instances and examples as that of Abraham treating with the sons
   of Heth, or that of the apostle Paul's deportment towards Felix,
   Festus, or Agrippa: we should soon see that much acquaintance with God
   is no way at all inconsistent with the most comely, fair, and even
   genteel deportment unto men; and that there is no inconsistency at all
   between religion, even at the very highest pitch, and a civil and
   ingenuous behaviour to them with whom we have to do.

   (2.) We may instance in what is still worse, namely, an unmerciful
   temper and disposition, and a practice suitable to it. There is a heart
   that is hard as a stone, which hath no bowels, no compassion, even
   towards the most moving objects, which do from day to day occur. And
   this the apostle in this very epistle tells us very plainly doth argue
   the love of God not to have place in us. And again

   (3.) Injustice, or unrighteousness is fitly reducible hither also as a
   violation of that royal law of love, inasmuch as love ought to be the
   principle of all the duties of righteousness. Else how can the duties
   of the second table be gathered up in that sum, as you heard before, of
   love to our neighbour as ourselves.

   And here comes in all falsehood, the violations of men's words and
   promises, so that one does not know whom to trust; which is the thing
   that directly tends to break up all human society. For every thing of
   commerce between man and man depends upon human faith, as commerce with
   God depends upon a divine faith. A man that cannot trust in God can
   have no fellowship with him; and when there is no such thing as trust
   in men, there is no place for commerce between man and man. For if that
   should be once banished out of the universe, the world must disband,
   all human societies must break up; men must resolve to live as beasts,
   retired in cells and caves and wildernesses.

   All that oppression also, extortion, and fraudulent commerce that are
   among men, belong to this head. If men did but love others as
   themselves, or if they would but do to others as they would be done
   unto, (which is the great measure of the exercise of love) none of this
   would be.

   (1.) We may add as another instance, furious passions, rash anger, and
   precipitous choler, and the contentions and strife which are so
   frequent, and so hotly maintained among men. And we may add to these,
   fretting, envy, secret repining in men's spirits when others are
   better, or do better than themselves. This is a disaffection of soul,
   which, as some heathens have noted, speaks. a direct quarrel with God,
   and a righting with him. Because a wise providence sees fit to favour
   such and such persons, therefore we will be sure to be none of their
   friends. And most of all repugnant to this duty of love are hatred,
   malice, revengefulness, a continual watching, and waiting for
   opportunities to do others an ill turn, from whom we conceive ourselves
   to have received one. And I instance,

   Lastly, In that from whence almost all this doth proceed, namely,
   inordinate self-love which hath set all the world at variance. This is
   what the apostle means by lust; an affectation of drawing all to
   ourselves, by an inordinate and extravagant affection to which we
   indulge ourselves and our own interest, each minding his own things.
   And so, whereas we should each of us fill up the sphere we converse in
   with love, that so dwelling in love we might dwell in God who is love,
   most men shrink their sphere into one point. They make themselves the
   only object of their love; all is confined there, and terminateth
   there. [72]

   And therefore, because men's private interests do interfere and clash
   with one another, hence it comes to pass that the world is filled with
   all those strifes, quarrels, contentions, wars, and blood, with which
   it is afflicted from day to day, and age to age. Whence are all these
   but from lusts? and what are those lusts all gathered up into one, but
   inordinate self-love, that knows no regulation, and will be confined by
   no just measures? It is a most apt and elegant expression of the Roman
   emperor Marcus Antioninus to this purpose, who says, "Such an
   inordinate self-love is like an ulcer, or imposthumated part, that
   draweth all to itself, and starveth the body to which it belongs." But
   there may be also

   2. A violation of this royal law of love to others, not only where
   things directly repugnant to it are indulged, but also where there are
   external carriages which would well comport with it, while they proceed
   not from a principle of love to one another, as the root and fountain
   of them. As in the opening of the doctrine we observed to you, that so
   waywardly are the spirits of men affected, that sometimes they will
   make the principle exclude the external acts and expressions, and
   sometimes the contrary. Men may carry it fairly and without
   exceptionableness to others, but it proceeds not from the principle of
   love, but some other principle.

   As for instance, with respect to acts of charity, some express their
   compassion to those who are in distress, by relieving them in their
   exigencies; but it is out of vainglory, and to procure themselves a
   name. They sound a trumpet before them and proclaim that they give
   alms, as our Saviour speaks of the pharisees. So a man will be just and
   square in his dealings, but it proceeds not from love to his neighbour,
   such as we owe to ourselves, but only from prudence; for if they do not
   carry it fair, they shall undo themselves as to their name and commerce
   in the world. Or it may proceed from fear; "I will not wrong or injure
   such a one for fear he should right himself upon me, and prove too hard
   for me at the long run." It may also proceed from deceit, and a
   treacherous disposition. They will carry it with all kindness to such
   till they can have an opportunity as it were to smite them under the
   fifth rib, as Joab did Abner, while he spoke to him peaceably. 2 Sam.
   iii. 27.

   These are manifest violations of this great and royal law; that is,
   they may be manifest to the persons themselves who are guilty, if they
   would but allow themselves the liberty to reflect, and take a view of
   the temper of their own spirits. In the exercise of this kind of love,
   agape anupokritos, an unhypocritical love is required, love without
   dissimulation. Rom. xii. 9.

   Now concerning all these things many are apt to think them but little
   matters. "They are but offences against men, say they, such as
   ourselves." Conscience as to these is little sensible or smitten in
   most men, because it is stupid, and cannot feel by reflections of this
   kind. But indeed these are very far from being light matters in
   themselves. They are things of dreadful import, if we consider what it
   is they argue or prove; that is, they argue little or no love to an
   unseen God. For thither it is that the apostle's argumentation directs
   us to run up the business. If it appear by these instances that there
   is no love to our brother, whom we have seen; how can there be any love
   to God, whom we have not seen? These things argue the little respect
   men bear to an invisible God, to an unseen Ruler and Lord. They argue
   how low the interest of the blessed God is among men, how little his
   authority and law do signify with them, and that men are sunk into a
   deep oblivion of him that made them.

   These miscarriages where they are more common, prevailing, and
   customary with men, are all rooted in atheism. Where there is but
   little respect to the duty between man and man, it is an argument there
   is a much less. respect to that which we owe to the unseen God, the
   Lord both of them and us. It argueth that when he hath settled an order
   in this world among his creatures, designed and appointed such a thing
   as human society, and directed that human love should be the common
   bond of that society; it argues, I say, a great want of respect unto
   God that men should make a rupture of that sacred bond, and so at once
   break themselves off from one another and from him.

   This is a matter of dreadful consequence if we do but run it up to its
   original, and lay the stress and the weight of the matter where it
   ought to lie. As was said of a certain country, "The fear of God is not
   in this place," (Gen. xx. 11.) where it was apprehended there was a
   danger of suffering violence in reference to property; so it may
   equally be said, there is no love of God in that place; that is, in
   that heart and soul where so many manifest violations are continually
   offered (habitually and without regret) unto a law upon which he lays
   such weight; a law which God has made so fundamental, and built the
   frame of so great a part of all our other duty upon it.

   And it may be now upon all this, some will be ready to say; "Truly it
   is a very sad thing there should be so little love among men as such,
   and highly reasonable it is that such love should obtain more than it
   does." But they withal think it very reasonable that they should be
   dispensed with, especially in two cases; that is, where men are very
   wicked, or where they are enemies to them. In the former case they
   would be dispensed with upon the account of their pretended respect to
   God, who is injured by men's wickedness; and they would fain be excused
   in the latter case, upon a real but very undue respect to themselves,
   whom they apprehend to be injured by such and such persons.

   Therefore I would say somewhat more particularly (before I leave this
   head of love to men as men) to these two cases; that is, to evince to
   you how great iniquity it is that such limitations should be admitted
   of as these; namely, that we would extend our love to men in general,
   except the more wicked sort of men, and also such as are particular
   enemies to ourselves.

   I. As to the former, the pretence is more plausible; they cannot
   apprehend how they should be bound to love a wicked man. And yet I
   shall shew you briefly what exercise love ought to have in that case,
   and upon what considerations; what place there is, and what room for
   love to those who are profligately wicked, whom we are thus urged to
   love.

   (1.) It is plain, negatively, that we ought not to love a man the
   better because he is a wicked man, and yet it is plain that most men do
   so. It is as ill to love a wicked man for his iniquity, as to hate a
   good man for his goodness; as Cain did his brother Abel, which is noted
   also in this epistle. For there are persons, "Who (knowing the judgment
   of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death) not only
   do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them." Rom. i. 32. But
   this is very remote from the temper of a gracious spirit. The Psalmist
   makes his solemn appeal to God concerning this case; "Do not I hate
   them that hate thee, O Lord? I hate them with a perfect hatred. I count
   them mine enemies." Ps. cxxxix. 21, 22. That is, barely considered as
   wicked, or upon the account of their wickedness and enmity to God;
   which is the thing upon which this professed, avowed hatred is founded.
   But notwithstanding,

   (2.) There is room still for the exercise of love to such persons
   several ways. As

   [1.] Love ought to be exercised in assuaging and repressing of undue
   and inordinate passions, which are apt to tumultuate, even in reference
   to cases of that nature. A fretting corroding spirit, when we find
   wickedness and a prosperous state in conjunction, is most expressly
   forbidden. "Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way,
   because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass." Ps. xxxvii. 7.
   And again, "Let not thine heart envy sinners, but be thou in the fear
   of the Lord all the day long." Prov. xxiii. 17. The daily and assiduous
   fear of God will be a check able to restrain such an ebullition of
   spirit where it doth prevail.

   In like manner a vindictive temper of spirit as to such is not allowed.
   There arc those, many times, who cannot have patience till providence
   has run its course, when they see wickedness prosperously triumphing
   and lifting up the head, but with impatient heat they are presently for
   calling down fire from heaven to destroy such. As it was with those
   over zealous disciples of our Lord, when entertainment and lodging were
   refused by the Samaritans. But see how our Saviour resents it, who
   rebuked and said unto them, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are
   of." Luke ix. 55. There ought to be the exercise of love to the
   mitigation, and depression of the inordinate workings of the heart in
   such cases. And also

   [2.] In serious and affectionate compassion, from the consideration of
   the tendency of their course, and of what these poor wretches are doing
   against themselves. The same compassion, I say, that we would have
   towards a distracted man, who we fear every moment will suffer by his
   own violent hands; and of whom we apprehend extreme peril, if he should
   be left a quarter of an hour to himself. These are persons that are
   likely to undo themselves, and in danger finally of piercing their own
   souls as they are wounding them every moment. The true spirit of
   Christian love to men as men, considered as never so wicked, ought to
   be exercised towards these persons upon that account, and because they
   are so. We reckon it as a very unnatural inhuman thing not to have
   great motions of pity and compassion, upon the hearing of towns,
   villages, and cities, in which pestilential diseases are raging, and
   tumbling thousands daily into the dust. But how much more dreadful is
   this case! and therefore how much more pitiful, compassionate love doth
   it require and challenge! And again,

   [3.] Love should have its exercise in offering up very earnest prayers
   for them. It is a very sad case when the hearts and consciences of too
   many may witness and testify, that they could tell how to rage against
   such persons as they have observed to be wicked, and find their hearts
   ready to storm, at them; but never can find, from time to time, an
   occasion to put up a prayer to God for them, who have no disposition
   themselves to eek for mercy to their poor souls. And

   [4.] In prudent and kind admonitions too, and rebukes, when providence
   administers the occasion; which is to be judged of by more rules and
   circumstances, than our present design will suffer us to mention. But
   besides what hath been said, as to the particulars in which this love
   is to be exercised in such cases, the considerations to move us to the
   exercise of it are manifold. As for instance,

   We ought to consider that such have human nature and reasonable
   immortal spirits, capable of service to God as much asourselves, and
   also of being in God as well as we are. And what! is there no place for
   love to them, who are bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, and
   even of the same reasonable nature with ourselves?

   We should also consider that we have a corrupt nature as well as they
   have, even the same corrupt nature. And if it has not broke forth into
   as ill practices, we owe it not to ourselves but to that mercy which
   distinguisheth persons, and doth exercise itself as it will. And it may
   be even as to practice too, such we have been in times past, as the
   apostle speaks of some of the Corinthian christians. 1 Cor. vi. 11.
   Therefore the wickedness of such is separable from their nature,
   otherwise if we think the case better with us, how came it separable
   from ours?

   Finally. Let it be considered, that God expresses a common love and
   kindness and indulgence to such. He does good to the evil and the
   unthankful, to the just and the unjust; and makes his sun to shine, and
   his rain to fall upon the one and the other. Matt. v. 45. Yea and his
   particular love hath fallen upon many such, and doth mostly fall upon
   such, where it does fall. For herein "God commendeth his love towards
   us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Rom. v. 8.
   If God did not know how to love sinners, not indeed for their
   wickedness, but notwithstanding it; where were we, and what would have
   become of us!

   [71] Preached November 29, 1676.

   [72] There is an excellent passage to this purpose, which I beg leave
   to transcribe verbatim from one of the author's discourses on
   self-denial, never yet published. "Consider the great incongruity, yea
   the monstrous incongruity of his self-addictedness, that a creature
   should be addicted to itself; a creature I say, be it as good and great
   as it will! For what is the creature itself, the whole collection of
   all creatures together, but a mere drop unto the ocean, the drop of a
   bucket? Such a minute thing, a little inconsiderable thing that sprung
   up out of nothing into something but the other day, now to set up for
   itself! Monstrous incongruity, horrid absurdity! most of all for that
   self, that most addict themselves to serve, fleshly self. A fit thing
   to be a Deity! a thing whose wants and cravings continually might
   convince one, that it is not nor can be alone. How does it hug, and
   cleave, and cling to a sojourning soul for a merely borrowed life!
   feeling itself going when the soul is going. Is this a fit thing to
   subsist alone; by itself and of itself r" And so the author goes on to
   shew, that "to set up for ourselves as if we were born for ourselves
   alone, or as if we owed nothing to our brother, nor had any dependance
   upon God, cuts us off from him and forfeits all interest in his common
   care."
     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON XVI. [73]

   WE have already shewn from these words, that their pretence to the love
   of God is both false and absurd, who do not join with it love to their
   brother. And by way of use or application we have animadverted upon the
   common temper and frame, so very unsuitable to what this scripture
   plainly requires and calls for; namely, the little love that appears
   among Christians in our days. And after we had pressed and recommended
   love to men universally considered, and shewn also that we are obliged
   in our carriage and practice to shew our love to men considered
   indefinitely, that is, every one with whom we have anything to do; it
   was observed, that some would fain indulge themselves in the neglect of
   this duty, and particularly in two cases think that they may challenge
   a dispensation. We therefore proposed to consider them severally. 1.
   The case of those who think themselves to be under no obligation to
   love wicked men, especially such as are persons of profligate
   wickedness. In speaking to which we have briefly shewn what sort of
   exercise, love ought to have in this case. The

   2. Case is that of those who think they may be dispensed with or
   excused from loving those that are their enemies, which we now proceed
   to consider. In the former case, as we have observed, persons are prone
   to think they may be dispensed without of respect to God, or on his
   account; in the latter case out of respect to themselves. A great piece
   of hardship many think it to be compelled to love them who they know
   are no friends of theirs, but are continually contriving mischievous
   designs against them. What room or place there can be for the exercise
   of love in such a case, we shall here briefly shew you, and then upon
   what considerations it ought to be vigorously exercised.

   (1.) For the former of these, on which I shall not insist very largely.

   [1.] There ought to be the exercise of love, even to enemies, in
   calming and subduing whatever is contrary thereunto in ourselves. All
   opposite passions, and the workings of them must be restrained; every
   thing of anger, wrath, malignity, bitterness of spirit, revenge or
   vindictiveness more especially. Thus ought love to be exercised in the
   maintaining of a calm in our own minds and hearts, that there may be no
   tumultuations of any undue or forbidden passion upon any such account.
   Yea and again,

   [2.] There ought to be love exercised in a more positive way; in
   forgiving or passing by whatever trespasses are done against us, as we
   expect to be forgiven ourselves. Love ought to be exercised to such
   even in doing them good; which is yet more possitive. "Do good," says
   our Saviour, "to them that hate you, and pray for them that
   despitefully use you." Matt. v. 44. We should do them what good we can
   ourselves, and pray for them that they may have that good which we
   cannot procure for them. The order and gradation of this precept is
   very observable. We are first in general enjoined to love our enemies,
   to bless them that curse us; and then we are enjoined to do them good,
   and to pray for them. As if our Lord had said, "First do all the good
   you can to them yourselves; but when you are gone as far as you can,
   then engage and set on work an almighty agent by prayer. Pray that God
   would do them good when you can do them none."

   We should take heed of looking on this as a Platonical chimaera; as a
   thing that can only have place in the imagination, or as a matter
   altogether impracticable. Christ has enjoined us no impracticable
   things. And there have been great examples in the world, that of his
   own and others, who have been so influenced by the grace of God as to
   give demonstration that this was no impracticable matter. And have we
   never heard of any that have rendered themselves remarkable on this
   account? of those of whom it hath been said, "No man could take a
   readier course to make such a one his friend, than by doing him an
   injury?" I believe some of us have heard of such instances even in
   these lower dregs of time. This we should then fix with ourselves as
   our resolutions. "Doth any man make it his business and design to
   trouble and molest me? Is he from time to time seeking occasions to vex
   me? The next opportunity that occurs to me of doing that man a good
   turn, I will be sure to lay hold upon it. I will be even with him that
   way. If I can do him good, I will. This I would fix upon my heart as a
   law."

   (2.) I will now proceed to give you some considerations that evince to
   us the reasonableness of such an exercise of love to our enemies; to
   such as bear us ill will, and are ready to do us an ill turn. As

   [1.] Consider it is the law and glory of Christianity to do so. That it
   is the Christian law is plain, and you have heard it al ready. You see
   how in the sermon on the mount, our Saviour reflects upon that mean,
   sordid, narrow principle of the Jews, which mostly in those times did
   possess and steer that people. "You have heard that it hath been said,
   Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you,
   Love your enemies, &c." Matt. v. 43. He then plainly, as to the matter
   of the exercise of love, takes away the distinction between neighbour
   and enemy. Our Saviour will allow no such distinction. And it is very
   plain, that by neighbour and brother he means the same thing in that
   fifth chapter of St. Matthew's gospel, where expounding the sixth
   commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," according to its spiritual sense
   and meaning, he makes the object of that law to be our brother; plainly
   in tending by brother all those, whom it was unlawful to kill. "I say
   unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall
   be in danger of the judgment." It is plain he means anger and killing
   with respect to the same object. We are therefore to love our enemies
   under that common notion of brother. This, I say then, is most clear
   that our Lord Christ hath made this law with respect to enemies. Love
   them, bless them, pray for them, and do good to them, are his express
   precepts.

   And it is the particular glory of Christianity, that such a
   constitution as this is, is to be found in it as a law. This must be
   acknowledged to be peculiar to Christianity. "To love friends, that is
   common to all men; to love enemies, that is proper to christians;" as
   said an ancient in the Christian church long ago. It is true indeed
   such a temper as this hath been well spoken of among the heathen: but a
   great deal more praised, than practiced; more applauded, than imitated.
   I remember one of them says, that "It is to imitate God himself not to
   hate any one at all, and more especially to terminate the exercise of
   our most fervent and complacential love upon the best." And we have
   heard of some who in lower things have done somewhat like this. As a
   great man of Athens, when on a certain night one followed him all along
   the street, reviling him and calling him most injurious and
   contumelious names, as soon is he came to his own house, he only
   commanded his servants to light the man home again. And every man must
   acknowledge it an amiable and lovely thing, when but a specimen has
   appeared, though never so faint, of such a kind of practice.

   But I say it is the peculiar glory of Christianity to form and
   habituate the spirits of those who are sincere unto this temper; that
   so the instances of this nature may not be rare, and that love may be
   exemplified in men's course and behaviour, according as the occasions
   of human life do require. And who can but reckon it a glory? For is not
   every creature upon that account the more excellent as his spirit is
   more conformed unto God? It is with this enforcement that this law is
   given by our Saviour, in the verse immediately after the precepts
   before mentioned; "That ye may be the children of your Father who is in
   heaven, for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and
   sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust." As if he had said, Love
   your enemies, and do good to them that use you ill, that you may hold
   forth a visible resemblance of God; that his image in this kind may
   appear and shine in you; and that it may thereupon be made known to all
   whose children you are, and by whom you are begotten; that it may be
   seen, that there is a nature truly divine conveyed and transmitted into
   you, and so inwrought into your temper as demonstrate you to be the
   children of God. Certainly it is the glory of a creature to resemble
   its Maker; and by how much the more it does so, by so much the more
   glorious is that creature, for what is the glory or excellency found in
   the creature, but the reflection and impress of the divine excellency
   and glory? And again, in the

   [2.] Place, let it be considered, that by this exercise of love to our
   enemies we make ourselves superior to them, according to the injunction
   which is laid upon us by the apostle: "Be not ye overcome of evil, but
   overcome evil with good." Rom. xii. 21. The latter part of the verse we
   may take notice of by and by. All the while that a man can continue and
   keep up a spirit of kindness, and benignity, and goodness to his
   enemies, it is plain he is not overcome; he is upon the upper ground,
   and hath unspeakably the better of them. And it is the easiest and
   surest defeat of malice that can be imagined or thought of. For it is
   certain where an ill-minded, mischievous person doth bend and set
   himself against such a one as you, he will not only set himself to hurt
   you but to vex you. It is not only your hurt that he aims at, but he
   would disquiet you, and put your mind to torture. So then it is plain,
   let a man have never so much hard usage from another, if there are
   manifest evidences that his spirit sinks not, but rather that he
   maintains a great spirit under all, it retorts the vexation upon him
   who designed it, and he himself alone is vexed who aimed at that
   design. Therefore he still keeps the superiority in this case, the
   temper of whose spirit remains within him placid, calm, and
   undisturbed; free from any unmanly, and most of all unchristian
   passions.

   And it is love which hath that dominion, that it will not let such
   impure and unbecoming things as envy, hatred, or malice come into that
   state, which is all made up of goodness, kindness, and love. The
   strength of that gracious principle, working with its due vigour,
   expels and keeps them from coming into the soul, or making inroads
   there. And all this while there can be no vexation, no disquietude in
   the spirit of such a one. It is fortified, and so strengthened as to
   shut out what ever would disturb and break the peace within. And so he
   that hath set himself against you hath not his design, because, you are
   not overcome by him.

   And to be sure whatever hand the devil hath in such attempts he is
   defeated; for he only desires you should sin against God, which
   certainly you do when you admit of any breach of charity. He does not
   care whether it be well or ill with you in external respects, only as
   it is a means to induce you to commit sin. So that if he stirs up a
   quarrel between any one and you his design is to transfer it between
   God and you; and having put it into the heart of any one to be your
   enemy, he would fain excite enmity in your heart against him, so as to
   render you God's enemy. This is the design he wholly aims at. Now he is
   defeated thereof, when your spirit remains conform to the law of God in
   this case; and you are not conscious of any evil temper of spirit
   towards them, who are in the mean time, working you all the mischief
   that they can.

   [3.] This temper of spirit carries in it, and a suitable deportment
   expresses, a holy, great, and generous independency upon external
   things. For any man's ill will to you, and whatsoever effects there can
   be of it, are all to you external things. Such a temper of spirit then,
   I say, shews your independency upon all outward things, and a
   superiority unto all external good and evil; that you do not take
   yourself to be greatly concerned in matters that are so foreign to you
   as such a man's ill will, or any ill effects thereof. For whither can
   they reach if you do not betray yourself, or be false to yourself?
   "Fear not them that can kill the body only, and after that have no more
   that they can do." Luke xii. 4. We are addressed to there as if we were
   hardly to reckon the concernments of the body any part of our own
   concerns.

   So indeed some heathens have been wont magnificently to speak,
   reckoning up such things wherein good and evil may be said to consist;
   and upon stating the notions of the one, and the other, all the good
   and evil things of the body are cast out of the account. "For," says
   one, "do you think I take my body to be ME, and this flesh to be
   myself?" And so another, "They can kill me, but they cannot hurt me."
   So when one was to be beaten to death with hammers and axes, he cried
   out, "Strike on! thou mayest break in pieces this vessel of Anaxarchus,
   but him himself thou canst not touch." And another discoursing upon
   that question, An injuria sit referenda? denies it peremptorily, and
   reasons against it most strongly. "A good man, says he, is neither
   capable of being affected with injury, nor of affecting any one with
   it. Injuries can properly have place only among ill men, who are upon
   that account offenders and breakers of laws. But among good men there
   is no one that can do an injury because he hath that virtue that will
   not let him; and he cannot suffer injury neither, because his virtue
   keeps it off, so as that it cannot have access to his spirit. It cannot
   invade or disturb his inward man. There is nothing to be detracted or
   taken from him by such an injury. For as to external good he doth not
   reckon it his, he cares not for it, and so parts with it without loss."

   Thus many of them have talked at a high rate, but it is the great
   concern of Christians that they may feel in themselves what may answer
   the import of such expressions; and as one said, "Live rather than talk
   great things. "And certainly it is a great thing when the temper of a
   man's spirit is such, as that in all his course he shall discover an
   independency upon externals; so as to hold it forth that he is little
   concerned with, or moved by any kind of good and evil as can only reach
   the out ward man, which ends with his life, and will shortly be as if
   it had never been.

   Such a temper of spirit as this is will soon keep a man out of the
   reach of this lower, and more troublesome sphere. He is above, liveth
   in another world, in another region. His mind and spirit are not within
   the reach of storms and tempests, but above that region which is liable
   to the stroke of such things; and so he continually keeps the
   possession of his own soul. It is a dominion over himself, a dominion
   in himself, the peace and tranquillity of reason that such a man
   enjoys. Thus says our Saviour, "In your patience possess ye your
   souls." That is a thing not very remote and alien from that temper of
   spirit that we are speaking of. For what think we patience is? It is
   not a mere sturdiness of spirit, a stoutness by which we are able to
   endure whatever comes; but it is that sweet and pleasant tranquillity,
   that repose of rest and spirit, by which it remains undisturbed
   whatever evils fall out to be our lot in this evil world. It is not
   merely to be able to bear, but to bear well; to bear becomingly and
   with a composed and quiet temper of mind, which admits no ill
   impression or resentments under what it happens to be our lot to bear.

   So it falls in with love, and is animated by it. Love is the life and
   soul of it. Patience towards him by whom I suffer evil, is influenced
   by love to him; and then that evil which I suffer by him signifies
   nothing. And it is by this I possess my own soul; otherwise, I am not
   master of myself, but am an impotent slave to this or that passion,
   raised and stirred up in me by this or that outward affliction. And
   thus I betray myself to an, injury, which otherwise could not hurt or
   touch me. And again

   [4.] It is further to be considered that the person that maligns me, or
   suppose them to be many that do so, they may yet have many
   excellencies, and on other accounts may be very worthy persons. And it
   would be a useful consideration, to keep and preserve a good temper of
   spirit in us, and to quicken love to its due exercise, if we would turn
   off our eye from that one particular thing, the ill will they bear to
   us, and look upon, the many things that are good and commendable
   besides. And whatever, real goodness there is, that doth certainly
   challenge love. For what! do we think love is to have its exercise no
   where, but where there is perfect goodness? Then are we to love no
   creature at all.

   What if in that respect we apprehend such a man to be evil or to do
   evil, who bears ill will to us or to our way, and those who bear our
   character upon them; yet may they not have very good things in them
   besides? Such may be sober, prudent, learned persons, and useful men in
   the world. And what! must; all that good be lost and buried, only
   because they have some particular animosity and ill will to us? It is
   too much to take our measure of what is to be loved, and what not, by
   ourselves and by our own interest; and it would argue a very private
   and narrow spirit, that we should judge of what is lovely and
   commendable, only by what has reference to us. We have no reasonable
   warrant to do so.

   And perhaps it is a disputable thing that such and we differ in; and it
   is not altogether impossible, that they may be in the right, and we in
   the wrong. And it becomes such persons as we are, conscious to
   ourselves of human frailty, not to be too confident that every man is
   in the wrong who opposeth himself unto us. At least, it would become
   the modesty of christians to search so much the more, and inquire the
   more diligently into the matter, that they do not a double injury by
   being opposite to such persons wrongfully at first, and then
   persevering in it; and letting an unworthy, unsuitable temper of spirit
   obtain thereupon, and take place in them.

   [5]. Suppose we be unjustly maligned by certain persons, then we have
   certainly God on our side; and consequently have a very good cause if
   we do not spoil it. If such and such bear us ill will, and we on our
   parts maintain the law of love inviolate, we are well as to the matter
   we suffer for, and we shall be tolerably well as to the manner of
   suffering too. Suppose we suffer hard things through their ill will,
   this is not so much, so we do but quietly bear our wrong; but if we
   miscarry here, we perfectly spoil a good cause. Whereas before we were
   right as to the matter, now as to the manner of our suffering under any
   one's displeasure, we have involved ourselves in guilt, and
   consequently have done so much to disoblige God from interesting
   himself for us. And certainly then we have done very ill for ourselves.

   [6.] If we do suffer the displeasure and ill will of any unjustly with
   the effects thereof, and yet keep up love in our own hearts, those
   persons who injure us, do first a great deal more injure God. Therefore
   we have all the reason in the world to turn private, selfish anger upon
   that account, into a resentment of the indignity and offence done to
   the common Ruler and Lord of all. And certainly by how much more the
   exercise of our spirits worketh out towards him, his interests and
   concernments; so much the less shall we find ourselves prejudiced in
   our own spirits, by what does more directly tend to us, and hath an
   aspect that way. We shall less consider that he hath injured us, and so
   be less tempted to render ill for ill, and hatred for hatred. He hath
   injured him that made him as well as us, which is a superior thing and
   a greater crime. And therefore that anger which turned the other way
   before, ought to turn against the dishonour that is done thereby to
   God, and into pity of the offender, upon the account of the anger of
   God incurred thereupon. And it ought to be considered further,

   [7.] That if any such do never so unjustly malign us, and therein wrong
   us, they wrong themselves much more. That would be a great allay to our
   passion to consider they slightly hurt us, but greatly hurt themselves.
   They are more injurious to themselves, than to those they design hurt
   unto. They do us but some external injury, but they wound themselves to
   the heart and soul. Sure then there ought to be that love in us, which
   should work pity in us upon that account. Nay further,

   [8.] We ought to consider that if they have wronged us, we have at one
   time and in one way or other wronged ourselves worse. We have done
   ourselves more wrong, than all the men in the world or the devils in
   hell could ever have effected against us, with their combined powers.
   If we have long lived in this world strangers to God, wandering from
   him who is our life: if we have lived in impenitence, disobedience, and
   rebellion to him, and strangers to his converse; we have then
   infinitely more wronged ourselves, I say, than men or devils can
   possibly do. And yet we can tell how to love ourselves for all that.
   Why then shall we not know how to love them who do us unspeakably less
   wrong, and are in no possibility of being so prejudicial to us as we
   are to ourselves? We can be indulgent to ourselves, who have done more
   wrong and hurt; why not to them, who have done us less?

   [9.] We shall do ourselves a great deal more wrong than it is possible
   for them to do us, if we requite them with ill will, and do not
   maintain the law of love inviolate to them. We shall do ourselves a
   greater injury than they can make us suffer, though it were in their
   power to do as much as one creature can do to another. For they can but
   hurt us externally, unless it be our own fault; but we hurt ourselves
   internally, if there be any unbecoming passion working or raging
   within. And what reason is there, because one giveth me a light
   scratch, that I must therefore give myself a mortal stab? And yet
   further consider,

   [10.] That whatsoever exercise our love shall have in this kind it will
   rebound upon ourselves, and turn to our own great advantage. For, in
   the first place, we shall have present peace and tranquillity within,
   which is a great reward; and we shall be also entitled unto that reward
   which is future, as all sincere obedience is, by the law of God and the
   Redeemer.

   First. There is a great reward in this temper of spirit which it
   carries in itself. For do but consider what it is plain the law of
   Christ requires in this case. "Bless them that curse you, do good to
   them that hate you, pray for them that despitefully use you, and
   persecute you." Matt. v. 44. Let us allow ourselves to pause here a
   little. What advantage is there in this temper of spirit, whereby a man
   without forcing, or straining the habitual frame thereof, desires the
   fulness of all good to them, who perhaps rashly or injuriously wish all
   harm to him! Certainly the very sense of those words, "Bless them that
   curse you," if they were but transferred into and impressed upon our
   souls, is of unspeakably more worth than all the wealth of both the
   Indies. For a man to bear that temper of soul in himself, and to be
   able on reflection to conclude, though he be assaulted on all sides by
   the unjust displeasure of men, that there are yet no other but good
   propensions of kindness and mercy, tenderness and compassion, and a
   readiness to do them all the good lie can, as soon as ever he has an
   opportunity; the pleasantness of such a temper, if known and
   experienced, no one would change for the greatest advantage this world
   could afford him. How happy is it to be able to say with the apostle,
   "Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it; being
   defamed, we intreat." 1 Cor. iv. 12, 13. As if he had said, "He that
   looks into our ways, nay into our breasts, shall be able to discern
   nothing but calmness there; even an undisturbed composure of spirit,
   and benignity towards them who are full of malignity to us." And

   Secondly. This is that temper of spirit also to which the blessed God
   hath particularly promised a reward. "If thine enemy be hungry, give
   him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: for
   thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward
   thee." Prov. xxv. 21, 22. Rom. xii. 20. It may be the person himself
   will not reward thee for so much good done to him. Concern not thyself
   for that; if he will not, God will. The Lord will reward thee for all
   that good which thou hast done, in lieu of the evil which he has done
   to thee. And I add,

   Lastly, In this way you may quite conquer him at last, to whom you
   exercise love to that height. And how glorious a conquest is this! The
   apostle says in the forementioned place, which is quoted from the
   Proverbs, that you shall by this means, (by returning good for evil)
   "heap coals of fire upon his head." I know there is a controversy about
   these words; some understand them in a good, others in an evil sense.
   Some say there by is meant, that you shall engage God on your side, and
   his wrath and vengeance shall vindicate your quarrel. Others think that
   we may understand by coals of tire, the melting warmth of love; which
   will dissolve and mollify the obdurate, malicious spirit of the unjust
   adversary. And I for my part make Rule doubt but that is the meaning,
   and I am the more induced to believe it from what we find conjoined in
   both these scriptures. It is in the Proverbs, "The Lord shall reward
   thee," as one that hast been a subordinate benefactor to himself; who
   doth good to those, who carry it very ill towards him. But to this
   passage quoted by the apostle is subjoined this exhortation; "Be not
   overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good." Your goodness makes
   you glorious conquerors, and will melt down your enemy, and subdue him
   to you at the long run.

   And there is no way wherein we can contribute so much to the
   accomplishment of God's promise, to wit, "If a man's ways please the
   Lord, he will make his enemies to be at peace with him." Prov. xvi. 7.
   And we have the most reason (though we are not to limit God as to the
   time or method of working things) to promise ourselves a happy issue
   and success this way, that is, to make our enemies at peace with us;
   when we in our whole deportment express and hold forth nothing but
   benignity, kindness, and sweetness to them, how ever harsh in their
   words and actions they are to us.

   And we ought to bethink ourselves too (with which I shall conclude)
   that let us be put to forgive them never so much, God has forgiven us
   more. It is impossible they should ever offend us so much as we have
   transgressed against him. There fore let us not grudge to extend our
   love to our enemies, for if God had not done so to us, what had become
   of us? Miserable creatures had we been! "When we were enemies Christ
   died for us." It was for enemies he laid down his life, and exposed
   himself to those cruel sufferings which he underwent. And when we
   expect eternal life by him, who hath done so much for enemies will we
   not at his word, and upon the obligation, of his own law, conform our
   spirits and practice to our utmost herein? For it is impossible we can
   have any enemies so injurious to us, as we have been to Christ; all
   which injury and wrong he is yet willing to bury in everlasting
   oblivion.

SERMON XVII. [74]

   THE truth which we have more lately handled from these words is this:
   That their pretence to the love of God is both false and absurd, who do
   not conjoin with it love to their brother.

   We have insisted a little upon this doctrine, and have made some
   progress in the use, which was mainly intended to be this: namely, To
   animadvert upon the common practice of the world; and especially to put
   us upon animadverting on our own practice, wherein it is contrary to
   the law of that love, which we are required to exercise towards our
   brethren, considered as men, and as christians. We have already in the

   First place, shewn and complained that there is but little of that love
   which ought to be exercised to men, as men, and we have particularly
   spoken to two cases, wherein many would plead an exemption; namely, the
   case of those who are profligately wicked, and of those who are their
   particular enemies: And we have shewed you how reasonable and necessary
   it is that love should be exercised to them as men, notwithstanding
   either of these circumstances. We are now to speak

   Secondly, According to the other and more restrained notion of brother,
   to that love which we should have for one another as christians; or
   which should be generally exercised by us upon a Christian account. And
   is it not worth our while to take notice, how the law of such love is
   most commonly violated among them who bear the Christian name, and to
   give instances hereof? We will do this in two kinds. That is, we shall
   give you both private and positive instances, and let you see by both,
   how the law of love is too frequently broken and intrenched upon, even
   as if it were not a sacred thing.

   I. We shall give you some private instances of this, wherein persons
   appear not to do what the law of love doth require. As

   1. When the object of this love is mistaken; that is, either stated
   with too much latitude, or else is too much narrowed and limited.

   (1.) I say when it is stated too largely, and men do give exorbitant
   measures of Christianity. There is a love to be exercised to all, as
   you have heard before; but there is, many times, a very unwarrantable
   extension of the notion of Christianity. There is so manifestly, when
   persons think the very assumed name itself a criterion enough of a
   christian, and so would stretch that which is peculiarly Christian love
   to a proportionable latitude. As very often the Christian name is
   assumed, and taken on by such persons as understand not, nor believe
   any more of the Christian religion than mere pagans. As to them it is
   by mere hap that ever that name comes upon them. As if it were enough
   to make a christian, only to live on such or such a turf; or as if
   because they think it fit and convenient to call themselves christians,
   therefore they must be accounted as such; and under that consideration
   be owned, respected, and loved as such without any difference, though
   all their practices hold forth nothing less than a perpetual avowed
   hostility unto Christ, as it is with too many others.

   I would indeed allow to that profession as much of respect as can, with
   any appearance of justice, be understood duly to be long to a name; and
   such are to be loved suitably to the state and condition they are in.
   But totally to mistake their state and condition, and then to exercise
   love to them without discrimination according to that mistake,
   certainly there is a great injury done in this case: especially where
   the case is so very apparent that persons more significantly shew
   themselves what they are by what they do, than can be known by what
   they are called. And then,

   (2.) When the notion of Christianity is too much narrowedand
   restrained, or of those whom we are to account and love as, christians.
   The whole christian fraternity is confined by some to those of their
   own party, or particular way and per suasion in respect of some little
   things, altogether extra-essential and circumstantial only to religion.
   And so Christian love comes to be confined to, and is exercised only
   within this little circle. This is a very great injury on the other
   hand; and the same thing in effect as to say, Lo, here is Christ, and
   there he is, yea, it is to say exclusively Here he is, and no where
   else! And it is as great a fault to say he is not where indeed he is,
   as to say he is where he is not. Love to christians, as christians,
   surely ought to run a larger course. And again,

   2. When the principle of love doth languish. Suppose the object of it
   to be stated never so rightly, without any error or mistake, the
   languor and decay of the principle does every whit as much intrench
   upon the law of love, and is a more injurious violation of it, than a
   mistaking the object. When love so exceedingly fails among christians,
   as such, that upon reflection it is hardly to be known whether any such
   thing be alive or at work or no; when, I say, our love so waxes cold,
   it is, as our Saviour intimates, a time of great iniquity. And it is
   plain he means it of that love that ought to have its exercise to
   christians, fellow-christians, and not merely of love to himself. For
   in the context you will find him speaking of persons betraying one
   another; and hating one another; and then he adds, "Because iniquity
   shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." Matt. xxiv. 12. And
   indeed the cause is very manifest and obvious to be from thence, from
   the abounding of iniquity.

   He that loveth a christian as a christian, must be under stood to love
   Christianity itself proportionably more. That which makes a thing such,
   is more such; that which makes a person lovely, is more lovely. To love
   christians as christians, is to love their religion. But now, when once
   the iniquities of the times abound, many who loved professors before
   grow cool in their love It was taken up for their conveniency, and it
   is laid down for their conveniency, according as may best serve their
   turn.

   Now this coldness of love among christians considered as such is a
   dreadful token, how little and slight an account so ever is made of it.
   The law of love doth not only say, Love your brother or one another;
   but with a pure heart fervently." 1 Pet. i. 22. And it is not a little
   that is contributed to the life and vigour of religion itself, by the
   vigour and lively exercise of this love. Therefore this great duty is
   recommended upon the very account, and with this design that our hearts
   may be established in holiness. "The Lord make you to in crease and
   abound in love one towards another, and towards all men, even as we do
   towards you; to the end he may establish your hearts unblamable in
   holiness before God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
   Christ with all his saints." 1 Thes. iii. 12, 13.

   3. An unaptness to take care of avoiding offences among Christians is
   another breach of this same law of love. Too many lay no restraints
   upon their spirits in this matter at all, or have no consideration of
   the case; never saying, "Shall I offend by this or that, or shall I
   not?" And others are as faulty in being apt to take offence, where the
   matter carries none in it. They are testy, froward, and. captious, so
   that no one knoweth how to converse with them, or careth to have to do
   with them, or to be of their society. And again,

   4. That I may hasten through many things, which I would at this time
   say to you in the close of all this long discourse, a very great
   difficulty either to give or receive satisfaction, is very unsuitable
   to the love of our brother.

   To give satisfaction: how are the spirits of many straitened and bound
   up in this case, by their own pride and self-conceit, and the great
   opinion which they have of themselves! As if it were a far greater
   reflection to say, "Sir, I have done wrong;" than it is to do another
   wrong. Or that men must needs give out themselves to be of something
   above a mortal human race, that it is impossible they should ever have
   offended, or ever do amiss. How great mischiefs would one such word as
   this sometimes prevent, among those with whom we have a familiar
   converse, "Sir, I confess I have not done well in such a thing, pray
   pass it by!" That great precept of confessing our faults to one
   another, and praying for others, (Jam. v. 16.) how is it quite thrown
   out of doors now-a-days! how rare instances are there of any such kind
   of practice.

   And there is as great an unaptness on the other hand to receive
   satisfaction. Persons insist highly upon the wrong, and cannot abate so
   much as one punctilio. Such things as forbearance and forgiveness,
   where there is an offence and wrong done, how little do they obtain in
   common practice in our time! And it is amazing to think that the moving
   enforcements which we have in Scripture of that one thing, should
   signify so little among us. Forgive ye one another the trespasses that
   ye commit one against another, even as God for Christ's sake freely
   forgave us. Oh what! should not such a consideration as that is prevail
   with Christian hearts to forgive, when it is considered how freely God
   for Christ's sake is said to forgive us? "Be ye kind to one another,
   tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake
   hath forgiven you." Eph iv. 32. Col. iii. 12, 13. And again,

   5. A mutual shyness and strangeness to one another, without a
   sufficient cause, is also unsuitable to this Brotherly love. Many
   Christian friends grow of a sudden strangers to one another, and no one
   can tell how or whence it should be. It may be the person that is
   passive in the case is altogether at a loss to account for it. For a
   long while he observes such a one to grow a stranger to him, and he
   cannot devise what should be the reason, or whence it should proceed,
   but upon a surmise. As if it were so great a difficulty to ask a person
   the question, Is it so? or if so, were it well? But instead of this,
   alienation must be the next thing, the first thing done without any
   more ado.

   How intolerable is this among Christians! And surely if we should live
   to see a day wherein the Christian community should be scattered, and
   we tossed and driven to and fro, it may be it would be a grateful sight
   to meet such a man, to see such a face in a wilderness or upon the tops
   of mountains, whom formerly we could not endure. Cordial then perhaps
   would be the embraces among those persons, who almost mortally hated
   one another before. We have reason to pray to God that such distempers
   of mind among us be not thought fit to be cured by such means.

   6. Another instance is neglect of mutual admonition and exhortation
   among Christians concerning known sins or manifest neglects of duties.
   We know that this is frequently pressed in Scripture, and the charge
   and weight of it is laid upon our love. Yea to neglect this is an
   interpretative hatred. "Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart,
   thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon
   him." Levit. xix. 17. How often are we called upon to exhort and
   admonish one another? "Exhort one another daily while it is called,
   To-day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."
   Heb. iii. 13. And how strange a thing is it, that any should take upon
   them to pass over such commands as these, as if they were reversed, as
   if they were repealed, as if such laws were abolished! Do we take upon
   ourselves arbitrarily, and at our own pleasure to abolish the Bible? or
   to abandon in our practice things as plainly pressed upon us, as any
   thing in the world can be? And how little is it considered how great a
   share such persons as neglect this duty of admonition, hath in the
   miscarriages of such as they converse with? How much do they partake of
   their sins! "Such a man would have been a more reformed man, less
   passionate, more orderly in his family, not so light and vain, if I had
   but, when occasion was offered to me, dropped a seasonable word to
   him." And so instead of having the benefit of Christian society, and
   partaking the fruits of one another's graces, we partake of one
   another's sins, and share the guilt with them. That is a sad part of
   Christian community!

   And there is many times as much fault in the undue manner of reproving,
   as in the neglect of the thing itself; when it is done in so proud, and
   imperious, and passionate a way, as if the design was not to correct
   such a man's faults, but only to vent my own passion. Or while I
   pretend to mend the faults of another, I myself shall commit a greater.
   For it may be, the fault in the manner of reproving, is greater than
   the matter which I take upon me to reprove. But when this duty is sues
   from love, and is so managed as that it may plainly be seen to be the
   product of love, then as it is in itself a great duty, so a great
   blessing doth often accompany and go along with it.

   7. The neglect of doing good and kind offices for one another, as
   occasion doth require and call for, is altogether unsuitable to this
   law of love. For you know how we are charged and required, as we have
   opportunity, to do good to all, but especially to those who are of the
   household of faith. Gal. vi. 10. And undoubtedly the apostle, using
   expressions of such import as he does there, is not to be understood as
   if he meant that this kindness, or doing good, was to be confined to
   the poor and indigent only, or to necessitous persons; though that is
   one great part of the sense: it is then to be referred to those good
   offices we should do to all who stand in need of our help, though it
   may be they are not indigent; but notwithstanding are the objects of
   our love, in such or such a particular case, wherein they may possibly
   receive assistance from us. But when persons are bound up in
   themselves, and so are little capable of minding any one's interest but
   their own, how greatly is love hereby suppressed, and stifled in the
   exercise of it! But besides these privative instances,

   II. We shall give some positive instances too of the violation of this
   law of love, and so hasten to a close. And

   1. Hard thoughts and rash censures of one another do very little
   comport with the love that should be exercised towards brethren. With
   respect to their particular actions, words or expressions, we are many
   times guilty of great injustice, and Wrong is done to this law of love.
   That is, when upon this or that action that we see done by such or such
   a one, it may be against our inclination or judgment, we put the worst
   construction upon it that we possibly can devise. So in like manner we
   are faulty when we torture the words of another, and wiredraw them,
   that we may if possible make them speak a bad sense, when it may be a
   much better might be put upon them. Persons also are guilty in this
   regard, when they are prone to load the differing opinions of others in
   some smaller matters with the most odious, and many times with the most
   ill-grounded consequences; putting them as it were into bears and
   wolves skins (as some did the Christians in the primitive times) that
   they may be the more exquisitely worried, and torn all to

   But the matter rises many times much higher than this; and men proceed,
   upon some small matters of difference, to pass censures concerning such
   and such persons, as to their states Godward. They sit in judgment upon
   their souls, and pass determinations concerning them in reference to
   their very life or death. And yet it many times so happens, that such
   as contend for that small matter of difference are hypocrites, and they
   that are against it are hypocrites also. The one party is censured and
   judged as formal, superstitious hypocrites; and the other as
   phantastical, self-conceited, perverse hypocrites: and nothing less
   than the charge of hypocrisy will serve the turn, in this case, on the
   one hand or the other. So persons arrogate to themselves the peculiar
   business of the Almighty. But "Who art thou that judgest another man's
   servant? (This is spoken of such smaller matters as we are speaking of)
   Why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy
   brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ:"
   Rom. xiv. 4, 10. "Let us therefore (as it is afterwards inculcated and
   urged) follow after the things which make for peace, and things
   wherewith one may edify another." ver. 19.

   2. Rash anger is another positive violation of this law of love: or
   tumultuous and insolent passions, that suddenly rise and storm and rage
   in Christian breasts one against another; many times on very small and
   little provocations, but to that height as no provocation can justify.
   How little is it considered that our Saviour, in the interpretation
   which he gives of the law in his sermon on the mount, does so interpret
   the sixth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill," as to make anger against
   our brother a kind of murder, and to bring it within the compass of
   that prohibition! Moreover,

   3. Which is a great deal worse, inveterate grudges are also
   inconsistent with that love which we owe to our Christian brother.
   These strike at the very root of love, and tend to the starving and
   famishing the principle itself. Thus persons lay up something in their
   minds against this or that fellow christian, and there it shall lie,
   corrode, work and fret, till it is the occasion of their doing him
   hurt; but it is much more mischievous to themselves, and turns to their
   own far greater hurt and damage. "Grudge not one against another," says
   the apostle, "the Judge is at the door." Jam v. 9. An intimation that
   this is a matter that will be brought before the Judge. Here now is
   work for the Judge when he comes, that such and such have allowed
   themselves to harbour grudges in their hearts, till they are grown old
   and turned into rankling and festered sores within.

   And certainly to a truly Christian spirit that is itself, and in a
   right frame, nothing will be more agreeable than to say, "I would not
   for all this world know or experience any thing as a settled grudge in
   my heart to any one who or whatsoever he be; so as to wish that his
   finger should ache, or that he should have the least harm or hurt upon
   my account, or for any disaffection he may bear or express to me." This
   now is a truly Christian spirit. But to allow myself to treasure up
   such things; to let them remain (alta mente reposita, as it were)
   against such a man, is very much against this law of love. He has
   offended you; it may be you are as prone to offend him, or to offend
   another.

   It is little considered what is the true, the proper and right notion
   of the Christian church, or the churches of Christ in general. They are
   hospitals, or rather one great hospital wherein there are persons of
   all sorts under cure. There is none that is sound, none that is not
   diseased, none that hath not wounds and sores about him. Now how
   insufferable insolence were it, that in an hospital of maimed and
   diseased persons, one sick or wounded man should say; "Such a man's
   sores are so noisome to me, that I am not able to endure the being
   neighbour to him?" Is it fit to talk thus in an hospital "where all are
   sick? Cannot sore, and wounded men endure one another, when they are
   all there for cure? Indeed if a person is stark dead, apparently stark
   dead, it is not fit he should remain there to be an annoyance to the
   rest. But further,

   4. A secret delight taken in the harm of another is yet worse than the
   former. When those that call themselves Christians, or to whom that
   name may belong, secretly please themselves to see inconveniencies
   befall this or that person, this, I say, is a horrid violation of the
   law of love. It is a most unnatural thing to rejoice in the harm of
   another. In the body, as the apostle intimates, (1 Cor. xii. 26.) when
   one member is suffering, all the members suffer with it. And to delight
   in the harm of others is as contrary to the spiritual nature, which is
   diffused in the true body of Christ, as if the header any other member
   should rejoice that the hand or foot is put to pain. And

   5. Directly opposite to this, but no less inconsistent with this duty
   of loving our Christian brother, is envy at the good of another. When I
   behold the good of another with an invidious, displeased eye, because
   such a man is better than I am; or is better reputed, or reported of;
   or has better gifts, or parts; or there is more appearance of his
   grace; and he doth more good, has more to do good with: these are most
   insufferable things, most directly contrary to love.

   6. Most of all inconsistent with this duty is hatred. This is directly
   contrary to it, and, in the tendency of it, aims at no less than the
   destruction of the person himself. And how frequently is the case so
   even among some christians, that nothing can satisfy them but the
   destruction of those who differ from them! Nothing less than their
   destruction will serve their turn. This is a thing so common and
   manifest, as if it were quite forgotten that ever there was such a
   portion of scripture in the Bible as this; "Whosoever hateth his
   brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life
   abiding in him." 1 John iii. 15. And it is yet worse, when the very
   reason of that hatred is because such and such persons are better than
   themselves; as it is with many profane persons that go under the name
   of christians, and yet hate christians all the while for Christianity's
   sake; for living the Christian life, and observing the precepts of
   their common Lord: as Cain did his brother Abel, because his works were
   evil, and his brother's righteous. To shut up all,

   7. Another positive instance of the violation of this law of love to
   our Christian brother (in the last place) is bearing hardly on one
   another's consciences in matters of external form relating to religion.
   I speak this with respect to private persons, for such I suppose my
   hearers to be. That is, when they do in their own minds wish, or any
   way within their own compass or capacity endeavour that the consciences
   of such who differ from them may be hardly borne upon.

   It is very true indeed that the pretence of conscience, for apparent
   flagitious crimes, is a most wicked and blasphemous pretence. For that
   is to entitle God to my wickedness, or to charge him with it; inasmuch
   as I cannot allege conscience for any thing, but I must in that case
   look upon it, and refer to it as God's substitute and vicegerent, and
   as doing his part within me. Therefore to pretend conscience for any
   thing that is in its own nature wicked and flagitious, is to cast all
   upon God; and to pretend that he hath enjoined me to do such or such a
   wicked thing. But when the difference is about small matters, which are
   (as we said before) extraessential to religion, even by common consent;
   it is a great violation of love for Christians in this case to affect
   and desire to have those who dissent from them hardly dealt withal, and
   their consciences grievously imposed upon on this pretence, that they
   must be, in such forms and external modes of religious worship, just as
   themselves, or they are not to be endured.

   We do not count it necessary that it should be so as to the natural
   body. For I look upon matters of external form in the church, as I do
   upon the external vestments or coverings of our bodies. Now we do not
   think it necessary, that every member of the natural body, should have
   a covering of the same shape, size, and colour. And if this case were
   but considered as it should be, and Christian love did but do its part
   (abstracting from what necessity there may be by an authoritative
   sanction) we should not think it more necessary, that every member in
   such a christian community should be clothed in external form alike,
   than that every part of the body should have the same sort of garment;
   or, that for conformity's sake, a man should wear a cap on his foot as
   well as on his head.

   Love, if it might be allowed its place and exercise, would consider the
   necessities of the several members. Love to ourselves, in the natural
   body, teaches us to do so. Sometimes it may be I have a sore toe or a
   hurt finger, that will not endure a pinching shoe or a strait glove:
   yet I do not think it necessary to cut off that finger or toe, or to
   let it go naked; but I provide a covering for it that it will bear, and
   that is suitable to it. Certainly, Christian love would lead us to act
   in like manner to the members of the Christian body, if it had but the
   place and exercise that belongs to it and which it claims.

   Therefore now to conclude, let it be seriously considered by us how
   happy a world, and how happy a church it would make, if we could but
   learn according to what we have heard, to exercise this love to men as
   men, and to christians as christians. There would then be no contention
   in the world, or the church, but only a striving who should do the most
   good, and who should be most good and kind to others.

   And it is a vain thing to hope, until the spirit of love revives ever
   to see good days. It is no external thing that will do the business. To
   be brought under the same form in every punctilio, in every minute
   circumstance, what would that do? What I say would this do if love be
   wanting, which is the life and soul of all communities, especially of
   the Christian community? Without this, the body would hang-together but
   as a rope of sand. Love then alone is the unitive, living cement, that
   joineth part and part and all to the head. It is this that must make
   Christianity to flourish, and the Christian church a lovely and a
   lively thing; a thing full of loveliness, life and vigour. And happy
   will it be when hearts are knit together in love, and all aim at the
   edification of one another, and also at the good of the whole; bearing
   with one another in tolerable things, and labouring to redress what is
   intolerable and not to be borne. Therefore as we are to direct our
   prayers this way, so let us direct our practice also amongst ourselves,
   and all those with whom we converse. And so I have done with this
   scripture.

SERMON I. [75]

   Acts i. 7.

   And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times
   and the seasons, which the Father hath put
   in his own power.

   THESE words are part of our Saviour's reply unto an impertinent
   question that was put to him by his disciples; after he had some time
   conversed with them since his resurrection, and immediately before he
   ascended, and went up into glory from them. They inquire of him, saying
   in the 6th. verse, "Lord wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to
   Israel?" He answers, "It is not for you to know the times or the
   seasons which the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall
   receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon, you; and ye shall
   be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in
   Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." And then it
   follows, "when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was
   taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight."

   It is obvious to the observation of any, that read the Evangelical
   history, what it was that the minds, even of Christ's more immediate
   followers, were intent upon, during the time of his abode in the flesh
   among them; and great was the expectation they had of a time when the
   Roman yoke should be shaken off, and when Israel, that had now been
   tributary long to that power, should be restored to its liberty. And
   when they found that they had now got among them one that manifestly
   appeared to be an extraordinary person, who could heal the sick, raise
   the dead, and do all other wonders with a word, they little doubted but
   now was the time of this great turn and revolution, which they so much
   hoped for. He that could feed multitudes as with miracles, they doubted
   not could easily maintain an army strong enough to do the business,
   upon very easy and unexpensive terms.

   But see at length now what this great expectation of theirs came to!
   Which expectation, you must know too, had a private aspect even towards
   themselves, and their own concernments; for they doubted not if their
   Head and Lord became s6 great, they that were immediately related to
   him, must share proportionably in his greatness: and some of them, as
   the gospel tells you, thought of nothing less than sitting at his right
   hand, and left hand, in this his temporal kingdom which they thought he
   was about to set up. But see, I say, what this expectation came to!
   Him, whom they expected to be a potent glorious king, they had seen
   apprehended, and haled to judgment, and to death, as a most ignominious
   malefactor. They had beheld the end of him, and seen him expire, and
   die upon a bloody reproachful cross; and now all these great hopes of
   theirs were vanished. "We trusted," say they, "that this was he that
   should have redeemed Israel." Great hopes we had, that the so long
   expected work would now, without any possibility of frustration or
   disappointment, have received its accomplishment and be brought to a
   glorious period. But they saw their hope laid in the dust; and now they
   reckon there was nothing more to be looked for from him; there was an
   end of him, and all their expectations from him. We hoped this was he;
   but we are fain now to think we know not what, or to think other
   thoughts of him.

   Well, but at length he revives, and rises again; and now their hopes
   revive, and rise too. But their hopes are still of the same carnal, and
   low alloy; still their minds run the same way they had done, and they
   take up the matter afresh where they had left it. "Come Lord, what
   sayest thou now to this great business? Wilt thou now at this time
   restore the kingdom to Israel? Now that thou hast conquered this same
   death that hath befallen thee, what canst thou not conquer? Shall the
   business be yet done?" See what he tells them in this reply of his; "It
   is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath
   put in his own power." What kindness (as if he had said) God hath for
   Israel, in that respect you intimate, it belongs not to you to know; it
   becomes you not to inquire. In the mean time there is another work for
   you to do. "You shall receive power, when the Holy Ghost is come upon
   you, and you shall be witnesses to me in Jerusalem," &c. He answers
   them first with a rebuke, and then with a promise. With a rebuke of
   that curiosity and carnality, which they betrayed in their question. As
   if he had said, "You meddle with things that concern you not; you too
   busily pry, and with an eye too daring and adventurous, into matters
   which God hath purposed to reserve and hide from you." But unto this
   mild rebuke he adds also a gracious promise. "There is a work for you
   to do that is properly yours, and which you have been designed to, and
   you shall be fitted and qualified for it; and pray let that content
   you, and serve your turn. Your work and business must be to be witness
   bearers to me, to my name and truth; to be my agents to carry on the
   business and design of that spiritual kingdom, which I am intent to
   establish, and promote, and spread through the whole world. And in
   order thereunto, you shall have a power come upon you which you shall
   little understand till you feel it, and which shall furnish you for
   this great work. "You shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is
   come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem,
   and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the
   earth."

   You see then the occasion and drift of the words, which I have designed
   at present to speak to; and these two things, (that we may not lose
   more time in any thing previous) we may observe from them,

   I. That there are times and seasons respecting the church of God in the
   world, which the Father doth reserve and conceal in his own hand and
   power from men. And

   II. That they are not concerned to be solicitous or make inquiry
   touching those times and seasons, but are to be patient of ignorance in
   reference thereunto. These I shall briefly open, and assert severally.
   And then,

   III. Apply them jointly together.

   I. That there are such times and seasons, that have reference to the
   state of the church of God upon earth, which the Father doth reserve
   and hide from men, in his own power. Now here concerning this we are to
   inquire, what these times and seasons are; and then what the hiding of
   them in God's own power doth import, which will serve for the
   explication of this truth. And then we shall let you see upon what
   accounts the blessed God is thus reserved towards men in this matter,
   hiding the events of such times and seasons in his own hand and power;
   and therein you may have some account of the reasons of what is
   asserted in this point.

   As to the explication of it, two things are to be spoken to, namely,
   what these times and seasons are; and, what the hiding of them in God's
   hand and power is, or the putting them there, as it is here expressed.
   As to the former:

   1. The times and seasons which he doth so hide, we may say concerning
   them that he doth conceal, first the final and concluding season of
   time, the period and upshot of time; and then, of each man's own
   particular time. He hides

   (1.) The period of all time from men. We know not when the season shall
   be, that shall shut up time. It is a thing determined, that there shall
   be such a season, beyond which time shall be no more. As that great
   Angel is brought in swearing by him that liveth for ever and ever,
   "that there should be time no longer." Rev. x. 6. But we are elsewhere
   told, that "of that day knoweth no man, no, not the Son" (as man we
   must understand it) "but the Father." Matth. xxiv. 36. And,

   (2.) The period of our own times also he hides, and keeps in reserve,
   as a thing put in his own power, and not into ours. "No man hath power
   over the spirit, to retain the spirit, nor hath he power in death; and
   there is no discharge in that war." Eccles. viii. 8. The measure of our
   own days he hath not put in our power. If any would hold the spirit in
   that day, or detain the soul in the body in which they live, they
   cannot do it. No man hath power over the spirit, to retain the spirit;
   he must resign it when God commands it away; and that time is a thing
   he hath kept in his own power. You have that expression of Isaac
   remarkable to this purpose; "I am old, and know not the day of my
   death." Gen xxvii. 2. Though he was grown a very old man, and very near
   to death, yet he could not know the time: though it were so very near
   that he might be sure it could not be very far off, yet he professeth
   ignorance concerning the time still. "My times are in thy hand," saith
   David. And into his hands he commits his spirit, as you have in the
   fifth verse of the same psalm. That life which he knew he could not
   command, he very willingly commits; he is well pleased that the
   measuring of it should be in the hands wherein it was. As if he had
   said, "I desire not to have it in mine own hand; I commit my spirit
   into thy hand; let it lodge here in this tabernacle as long as thou
   wilt, and let it go forth when thou wilt; this power is better lodged
   in thy hands than mine." Moreover,

   There are contained within this compass of time in general, or of our
   own time, the seasons of good or evil unto the church in general, and
   the especial members of it in particular; which are for the most part
   unknown, and reserved in the hand and power of God.

   The good seasons seem to be more especially referred to here; for it
   was a certain good to the church of God that the apostles were
   inquisitive about. "It is not for you to know the times." God hath his
   set time, an appointed time, where in to favour Zion, that may seem
   instant and at hand now and then; as they speak in the 102 psalm (we
   may well suppose as they would have it) The time to favour Zion, yea
   the set time is come. Ps. cii. 13. Methinks it should be come; why
   should not the full time be accomplished? If one may make an estimate
   from the affections of the well-wishers of Zion, it should be come.
   "Thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust
   thereof." But this could not be peremptorily said; he had stated the
   time of it with himself; the appointment of it was a matter in his own
   hand and power. And by consequence

   The ill times, the more afflictive times of the people of God are hid,
   and put in his own hand and power too. For supposing that a good season
   be determined by him, a calm, and more serene, or halcyon season, it
   must be by consequence in his hand and power too to measure all the
   intervals: how long the intervening ill seasons shall last, how long it
   shall be that his people shall feed upon the bread of affliction, and
   have their own tears for drink, and have men riding over their heads,
   and they be themselves even as the street to them that pass over. All
   that time must come under the same mensuration, the mensuration of the
   same hand. So that to determine when the church of God shall enjoy
   better days, and how long worse times shall last, this they were to
   account and reckon upon that he had put it into his own hand and power.
   It is that which we have an interdict upon us to know. "It concerns not
   you to know, trouble not yourselves to inquire, the matter is in good
   hands." But then we are to consider too,

   2. What its being in the power of God and being put there doth signify;
   which last we are to consider chiefly as leading to the other. The
   force and emphasis of the expression, seems to set forth more, than
   that it should barely import they are in his power; the phrase
   signifieth withal a positive act that is put forth in reference to
   their being so; that is, an act of the divine will which hath
   determined with itself that it will have the matter so, that such times
   and seasons shall remain in his own hand and power. As for those
   expressions in Scripture (hand and power) they explain one another. The
   hand of God is nothing else, but his power; his active power by which
   he ruleth the world, and changeth times and seasons, as to him seemeth
   good. But if you inquire for a more distinct explication of this
   matter, How this power and hand of God exerts itself, in reference to
   such times and seasons? Why, it doth so, in reference to the existence
   of them, and to the discovery of them.

   (1.) In reference to their existence: his power doth effect, and bring
   it to pass, that there should be such times and seasons, as he hath
   stated and determined with himself. And so more particularly his power
   orders, or effects such things as these, in reference to the existence
   of the times and seasons. As,

   [1.] The commencement of them: that is, when such a state of things,
   good or evil, shall take its beginning; when such a cloud shall first
   begin to arise and spread itself over the horizon; when it shall
   scatter and be dispersed, and a bright and cheerful light spring up;
   "the day-spring from on high" to visit the desolate. This, his hand or
   power hath determined. And then,

   [2.] How long such or such a state of things shall continue. The
   duration of it, its bounds and limits, are the work of his hand and
   power. So long my people shall be afflicted; as he did determine
   concerning the people of Israel, from the time that he spoke to Abraham
   about that matter, namely, four hundred and thirty years; and then
   ensued that blessed peaceful calm, and the glorious and wonderful works
   of providence, which did make way for that and introduce it, whereof
   the history afterwards gives an account. And again,

   [3.] His own hand or power exactly measures all the degrees of good and
   evil, that shall be within such a compass of time; so as that there
   shall be nothing, more or less, than what his power orders. For we are
   not to take times and seasons here abstractedly; but so as to take in
   the events of such times and seasons: all those events which such times
   and seasons go pregnant with. All the births of those times, of what
   kind soever they be; his power orders every one so to come forth, even
   as it doth come forth. He works all things according to the counsel of
   his own will. Dan. iv. 35. And,

   [4.] That hand or power doth order all the occasions and methods by
   which such and such seasons, with all that they are laden and burdened
   with, shall be brought about. No thing comes to pass but as that hand
   or power doth direct and order: not only the effects, the things that
   are produced; but all their causes, or whatsoever is productive of
   them. And we may add,

   [5.] That the hand or power of God doth also order all the consequences
   and dependencies, of any such times and seasons. For there is still a
   concatenation in providences; and nothing falls out in the world but
   somewhat else depends upon it: this and that is done which is
   preparatory, and leads the way to something else that is to be done,
   till the end and the folding up of all things; till that season come,
   when it is determined, that time shall be no more. But,

   (2.) This hand or power of the Father hath its exercise not only in
   reference to the existence, but also to the discovery and notification
   of those times and seasons which he hath reserved in his own power.
   That is, either to make them known before-hand or not, as he pleaseth;
   or else to make them known more or less clearly as he pleaseth, with
   greater or less degrees of obscurity or perspicuity, according as seems
   to him good. This is that he hath in his own hand and power, either to
   reveal or not reveal them, what seasons shall be as seemeth him good;
   or if he let any light break out before-hand into the heads or hearts
   of those that are in covenant with him, then to let out so much and no
   more as seemeth him good.

   And this may suffice for the explication of the first point. And would
   you now have some reason of it, why he doth thus put future times and
   seasons in his own power, and keep them there; why it is always his
   will and pleasure, while such things remain hid and reserved, that it
   should be so; the reasons will partly respect him, partly ourselves.

   [1.] Respecting him there is a great reason for it on his part; that
   is, this twofold reason: it is his right, and it is his glory.

   First. It is his right to have futurity thus in his own hand and power,
   it belongs to him as he is Ruler of the world, the great Disposer and
   Orderer of all things. For is it not inconsistent with sovereignty, to
   be accountable for every thing one means to do? should there be no
   arcana imperii, nothing kept hid and secret? It cannot stand with the
   absoluteness, at least, of his dominion, and that power which
   rightfully belongs to him over the whole creation, that there should be
   nothing determined or done, but there must be previous notice of it
   given to his creatures. He gives no account of any of hit matters unto
   any. And then

   Secondly: It is his glory, and his honour: it is the peculiar honour of
   his Godhead, to have the prospect of all his works in view, even from
   the beginning to the end. A glory that he can not share nor
   communicate. It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, to hide things,
   to have his way in the dark, so as that his footsteps shall not be
   known; and so to steer the course, and manage the whole administration
   of his government, that none shall be able to trace him, or know what
   he will do next; neither make any certain collection from what is done,
   what shall be done. As the wise man says, "He hath made every thing
   beautiful in its time," (hath ordered all things in the aptest and
   fittest seasons for the same,) "also he hath set the world in their
   hearts, so that no man can find the work that God maketh from the
   beginning to the end." He hath set the world in their hearts, so as
   that the very world itself, that is, the stage on which are acted so
   many successive parts, doth become a blind to them, that they cannot
   see his way; nor from the beginning or former things conjecture, or
   make any collection what will ensue. As, you know, the eye that sees
   all things, sees not itself. He hath set the world in their heart, the
   seat of prudence, understanding, wisdom and knowledge; but the object
   is so close to the faculty that it cannot see. They cannot see what is
   done in the world so near them, so as to be able to discern and make
   inferences from any former things, to any future things yet to be done,
   at leastwise as to the timing of them, which our text refereth chiefly
   to. "Such a thing was done such a time, therefore such a thing will be
   done such a time."

   This then is his peculiar and singular glory, that he can out do
   apprehension; and counterwork the conjectures and guesses even of all
   men. Sometimes such a state of things according to all visible human
   appearances seems instant; it may be nothing but gloominess, darkness
   and horror is to be looked for at such a time, according to all the
   prognostics we can have; and lo! by a quick turn of providence, most
   unexpectedly a bright lightsome season is brought forth in view.
   Sometimes, on the other hand, external appearances are fair and
   pleasing; men are ready to cry nothing but peace, peace; and then a
   sudden cloud arises, and spreads itself over all, out of which nothing
   but storms and tempests ensue. And so doth the providence of God, as
   was aptly expressed by the poet, seem to sport with men; ludere in
   humanis rebus. God doth, as it were, glory over men in this kind, by
   giving them to see, how by letting such appearances come into view he
   can raise fears and scatter them; or excite such and such probabilities
   to make persons full of hopes, and presently dash them, that men may
   know the Lord omnipotent reigneth. There is no searching his
   understanding; he is not capable of being prescribed unto. None can
   direct the Spirit of the Lord; it runs the most unthought-of ways in
   its disposal and management of things. This then is reason enough as to
   God; it is his right to have the disposal of limes and seasons; and
   then it is his glory wherein his excellency doth shine and discover
   itself, and shews how far he transcends all the thoughts and
   apprehensions of men: how far his thoughts are above our thoughts, and
   his ways above our ways. And

   [2.] There is reason too, in reference to his people, why it should be
   so; that is, it is their great advantage that thus it should be. As

   First, That they may not be diverted from their proper work and
   business, the work they have to do from day to day, and from hour to
   hour; which certainly they would be, if they had the range of all
   future times open to them. They would be taken off from minding their
   present business; and spend their time in continual profitless ranges,
   to and fro, in the futurities that should lie open, and present a vast
   prospect to them. And again,

   Secondly, That they may not be disquieted; for certainly it would be a
   very great disquietment to the mind of a good man, if he did know all
   things that should fall out in the compass of time, even his own time.
   But I hasten to the other thing, and therefore enlarge not further
   here.

   II. The second point was this; We are not concerned, and therefore
   should not be solicitous to inquire, or know much of these reserved
   times and seasons, which he hath so put and hid in his own hand and
   power: "It is not for you to know the times, &c." And here we may
   reckon it is not for us,

   1. As being none of our right, it belongs not unto us; we can claim no
   such thing. And,

   2. As being no way for our advantage. It can profit us nothing. What
   should we get by it? It is therefore not for us. God hath so disposed
   the state of things, and the way of his dispensation towards us men,
   over whom he is Governor, as not to please and gratify our humour; but
   to do, in reference to his own, what may make for their real advantage.
   But what shall we be the better for knowing what God will do, what
   times or seasons shall come either of good or evil? I add further,

   3. It would be our great disadvantage, and a prejudice to us. For,

   (1.) It would multiply our troubles. For do not we know how apt we are
   to forecast troubles to ourselves? When we are not sure they will come,
   yet our minds will not be with held from a most tormenting anticipation
   of evil, and possible troubles; (we do not know they are certainly
   future, but we apprehend them possible) and so that which God would
   have us suffer but once, we suffer a thousand times. We ought to admire
   here the divine wisdom and mercy in conjunction, upon this occasion;
   that he doth not let us have any more knowledge than what will suit
   with our power in such things. What a dreadful concurrence would it be
   in us between infinite knowledge and finite power! Could we know all
   things, and yet do but this or that; if a man should have the knowledge
   of such and such things to come, but no power to prevent it (as alas!
   what can our impotency do?) how dreadful, I say would this be!

   There is a great deal of compassion in this: that since it belongs to
   our state as creatures to be able to do but little, to be mere
   dependencies, impotent things, that therefore we should not have a
   fore-knowledge of what it would be afflictive to us to foreknow. We are
   therefore put under a restriction that comes so close to us, as to
   stand betwixt us and to-morrow. "Take no thought for the morrow;
   sufficient for the day is the evil thereof." We are not to range with
   afflicting thoughts so far as to the next day. Thou wilt have enough in
   this day to trouble thee with, never let thy solicitude be conversant
   about the accessions of time. We foolish creatures should fetch the
   troubles of all our days into every day, if we could foreknow what is
   to come. Take then no thought for to-morrow! it is enough for you that
   you have One to think of you, and care for you. And it will make most
   for your advantage to be looked upon by him every day; who will make
   your strength to be sufficient for each day when it comes. And then,

   (2.) As it would be a prejudice to us in the multiplication of
   afflictions, so in the diminution of mercies. For there is a great
   accent of pleasure and delightfulness certainly added to them by the
   surprisingness of them, when they come most unexpectedly. How grateful
   is a bright, warm, refreshing sun, shining all on a sudden out of a
   thick dismal cloud! Memorable things have been done for the church of
   God that they looked not for: such things as eye had not seen, nor ear
   heard, neither had it entered into their hearts to conceive, or which
   they could form no conception of before-hand. "Who would have looked,
   said they, for such a day as this is?" How sweet is a mercy that comes
   unknown, unlocked for! "When the Lord turned again the captivity of
   Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with
   laughter, and our tongue with singing." Ps. cxxvi. 1, 2. God so
   provides in this matter, that nothing of the gust and sweetness of
   mercy shall be lost to his people; they shall have it with the best and
   highest set off or advantage. Now,

   III. To make some brief use of all that we have observed, taken
   together; we may learn hence,

   1. That there is an aptness in the spirits of men, even of good men, to
   be very inquisitively prying into futurity, beyond what God hath
   thought fit to reveal and put out of his own hand and power, as to the
   discovery thereof. "Lord wilt thou," (say his disciples,) "at this time
   restore the kingdom to Israel?" wilt thou do it now? It would not, it
   seems, satisfy them or serve their turn, to have some understanding,
   such as they might collect from the prophets, whom they had in their
   hands, that God had a kind thought towards Israel, had not utterly cast
   off his people: they cannot be content to know only so much; but, Lord!
   shall it be now? Wilt thou now restore the kingdom to Israel?

   That disposition of spirit, since it is so natural, ought to be watched
   and repressed; and as we find any hankering in our own spirits this
   way, we should see to it that they meet with their seasonable, and due
   rebukes, even from our own animadversions. We are, when a suffering
   time is upon us, very impatiently set upon it to know when it shall be
   over. If we have any expectation of a good time, oh! but when shall it
   be? Thus we would bring God to our punctilio, and to our very now. Upon
   such niceties would we be with him, so apt are we to dodge with the
   great Lord of heaven and earth. "That which I would have, shall it be
   now? or when shall it be? This is that I would be rid or freed of, but
   when? How long must I bear? how long must I wait?" This now is
   undutiful, and stands not with that creaturely submission, that is
   belonging and proper to our state: much less with the spirit of a
   child; that tractableness, resignation, yielding in all things to the
   Father's pleasure and wisdom, which is most agreeable to that relation.
   And again,

   2. We may learn hence, that times or seasons whether they be good or
   evil to a people, fall not out to them casually, or by chance; but they
   remain in the hand and power of God. We are too apt to let our spirits
   work many times as if we thought such and such things came to pass by
   casualty. For if any ill state of things come upon us, how apt are we
   to aggravate the evil of it to ourselves, saying; "Had it not been for
   such a thing, this had not come; this might have been kept off: if it
   had not been for the miscarriage of this instrument, our case had not
   been so bad. If it were not for this or that unhappy accident, all had
   been well enough." Alas! we forget, these things are in his hand and
   power that over-rules and orders all, that it is not blind chance that
   regulates the world, but the counsel and wisdom of God, that run
   through the compass of all events, and hath the conduct of all things.

   3. We may also learn, that men have it not in their hand and power to
   order times and seasons of good and evil, to God's people, as they
   please. We may sometimes seem to have that apprehension ourselves; and
   if we have not, some may have an apprehension, that it is in their hand
   and power to dispose and measure out good and evil, to the children of
   God, as they will. No, God hath not let the reins go yet, he hath the
   times and seasons in his own power. Say they sometimes, "We will
   pursue, we will overtake, and we will divide the spoil, we shall have
   our will over them," when God hath not said so: and his will and work
   shall stand against and above theirs. And take we heed of our
   attributing too much to creatures, that what men have a mind to, shall
   be; or what they have no mind to, shall not be. There is a God in
   heaven that changeth the times and seasons, as he seeth good. And, for
   the shutting up of all, let us in reference to this matter, and upon
   what hath been spoken to you, take in the close these few counsels.

   (1.) Let us labour to trust in him, who hath all the times and seasons
   which concern us, and his people, and the world, in his own hand and
   power. Have we not reason enough to do so, and encouragement enough?
   And so though we be blind and cannot see the product of to-morrow; know
   not what a day will bring forth; we shall have him to be eyes to us. He
   will be eyes to the blind, if they will but trust in him, As when a
   blind person is led by another he useth that person's eyes, who leads
   him. Let him lead us on from day to day, time to time y season to
   season. We cannot see with our own eyes, but is it not better for us
   that we have better eyes to see with? For we have one to see for us,
   who seeth infinitely better than we. We know not the product of the
   next day, or week; but is it not enough that he knoweth the event of
   all future times, and that he orders all things with exact judgment.
   "He is the rock his work is perfect, all his ways are judgment," (Deut.
   xxxii. 4.) or reason: the most exquisite reason, that is, the result of
   deliberation, and the most concocted thoughts. Deliberation, it is
   true, can have no place with him, who is the most absolutely perfect;
   but that which is equivalent is intended to be signified by the
   applying it to him. He sees with one view all the connexions of things;
   and so is able to outdo them who reason but by degrees, and by
   recollecting of things after things, so as to make a judgment at last.
   "Our God is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him."
   Isai. xxx. 18. To every thing there is time and judgment. He doth
   particularly state the time and season, and applieth to every thing its
   proper time when it is most fit it should fall out; and then it will so
   do to the best purpose. Trust in him, I say, who hath all future times
   and seasons in his own hand and power. The Father hath put them all in
   his own hand and power. Father! that is an expression of love,
   tenderness, compassion, and care. Is he not fit to be trusted then?

   (2.) Submit to him, who hath all things and seasons in his power;
   resign, I say, and yield the matter to him. Subdue an unquiet,
   turbulent heart; beat down all wayward and perverse reasonings. Father
   is a name of authority, as well as love. The Father hath put all things
   in his hand and power; he who is the Head of the family, that great
   family, which is made up of heaven and earth. And are you children of
   that family, and will you not allow that he orders the timing of things
   as to him seemeth meet.

   (3.) Since you cannot know his times and seasons, pray labour to know
   your own. Since you cannot know the times and seasons which he hath put
   in his own hand and power, know those that he hath appointed to you.
   Though he hath hid from you those seasons of future events, in the
   contingencies of the world, yet he hath not hid from you the duty of
   all seasons and events. This is our time. "Your time is alway ready,"
   saith Christ; (John vii. 6.) that is, the present time is ours, that he
   hath put as a prize into our hands; the present time for present work,
   if we have wisdom and hearts to make use of it.

   It is a dreadful thing not to know our own time. "For man," says the
   preacher, "also knoweth not his time." Eccles. ix. 12. That was the
   miserable state of Jerusalem; they knew not the time of their
   visitation. For our Saviour beheld the city, and wept over it,
   considering what was coming upon it. Enemies should begirt it round
   about, such and such ruins should befall it, and all because they did
   not know in their day the things that did belong to their peace; but
   now they were hid from their eyes. Thou hadst a good time, as if he had
   said, if thou wouldst have known it. We are barred up as to future
   time; but we are bid to know the present time, and what God calls for
   at our hands therein. We may know when it is a time to mourn, and when
   to rejoice; when to weep, and when to be merry and pleasant.

   He points out to us our more extraordinary praying seasons, if we would
   but observe the finger of providence, and take notice of his
   indications. It is a lamentable case, when we can not understand the
   time of such a thing; when we cannot know this is a time for such work,
   and this for such work. The present time points out such and such work
   that we should be intent upon We cannot indeed know these reserved
   times and seasons; let us then know the times, that are left open to
   our view. As now this present time is come, but do we know what ought
   to be the work of this time? God hath ordered for us this time, this
   season to be waiting for him, humbling ourselves before him. The season
   tells us what the working of our souls should be now at this time; what
   there should be of humiliation; what of striving and wrestling with
   God; what endeavours to take hold of him, that we may yet keep him with
   us, while we have him. It is a happy thing to be able to know a praying
   day, when it comes; to know it so as to answer it by a suitable frame
   and temper of spirit.

   So also you are expecting shortly another good time, a season of
   drawing nigh unto God, and to converse with him and with your great
   Redeemer, even at his own table. If God do order for you that season,
   that will tell you what disposition of spirit there must be; and you
   ought to be forecasting, that you may have a temper and disposition of
   spirit, suitable to such a season, and the work of it. If you have the
   season, it will then prove a blessed season; and if you should be
   deprived of it, yet all these sweet gracious workings of spirit will
   not be lost, they will be a rich advantage to you even in reference to
   a future holy course. Oh then if you cannot know God's time, labour to
   know your own! the present time for present work, that he seems to call
   you to. And then I add in the

   (4.) And last place; Since you cannot look far into future time, look
   more into eternity, over and beyond all time. For it is only future
   time that God hath shut up from you, while he leaves eternity open to
   you. He would have you look over time into a vast and boundless
   eternity. Look then not to the things that are seen and temporal,
   (things measured by time) but to the things unseen and eternal! And
   doing so, this will be your great advantage and gain; you will find
   that though the outward man should perish (as there will come a crash
   upon all our earthly tabernacles, and down they must) the inward man
   will be renewed day by day. If then, the outward man will perish, let
   it perish; if it will go down, let it go; there is somewhat we shall
   gain by that loss. In the mean while we shall in our souls be renewing
   strength day by day, if we keep our eye open to eternity; to that
   unseen state of things within the vail, whither he hath led the way,
   who is our great Forerunner to the glory that is to be revealed; with
   which glory the sufferings of the present time, this now, are not to be
   compared; not to be named in the same day, with that felicity which
   accrues to us hereafter. In a word, what we now suffer, within the
   compass of time, cannot bear any parallel with that glory and
   blessedness, which is to come after time is done. Let us therefore in
   the mean while seriously mind these things.

SERMON II. [76]

   2 Cor. iv. 8.

   We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed.

   I SHALL detain you very little about the context. In the foregoing
   verse the apostle speaks of a certain treasure which was committed to
   earthen vessels, with this design, that the excellency of the power
   might be of God; that is, might appear to be of God, and not of men.
   What this treasure was you may collect from the 6th verse. "God who
   commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our
   hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the
   face of Jesus Christ." Now "this treasure," saith he, "we have in
   earthen vessels;" that is, the light of the knowledge of the glory of
   God, shining in the face of Jesus Christ: conveyed in and through a
   Mediator, and discovered in the gospel. It is a treasure of light
   whereof he speaks, a treasure of glorious light. And this is that,
   which he said was put into earthen vessels; intrusted to the
   ministerial disposition of very mean, and very weak and fragile
   instruments. And that upon this account, that all might see that the
   excellency of the power was of God, and not of them; that there was
   somewhat more than human in the matter, that such effects, as he had
   spoken of in the close of the foregoing chapter, should follow that
   dispensation they were intrusted with. Where also it is by the way
   intimated, that this same treasure is not a treasure of mere light;
   feeble, ineffectual notions, that were apt only to reach the mind of a
   man, and stay there as the matter of contemplation only; but it is a
   certain vital, vigorous light whereof he speaks, a light that carries
   power, efficacy, and a transforming influence along with it. The light
   of that glory which being beheld, changeth souls into the same
   likeness, from glory to glory. This light we have, this treasure of
   glorious light, in earthen vessels; that so the excellency of that
   power, which accompanieth this light, may appear to be of God and not
   of men: that all who observe it may be convinced, and constrained to
   confess something divine in it, when such things are discovered and
   held forth to men, as work at the rate, which the Gospel dispensation
   was designed to do, and did actually do.

   And then in the words that we are to speak unto, and those that follow,
   he giveth a proof and demonstration of the excellency of the power,
   that did accompany and go with the Gospel light wherever it reached its
   end, and did the work to which it was designed; and to which it was
   also in its own nature adapted, and made suitable. Let this be a proof
   to you (as if he had said) that there is a certain excellency of power
   accompanying that light, which we are appointed to convey to the world;
   namely, that we, who are thus intrusted, though we are but a company of
   earthen vessels, are not for ail that presently knocked asunder by
   being on every side struck at, and dashed against. "We are indeed
   troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not
   in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
   destroyed." Certainly there was somewhat more than ordinary in this
   matter, that a little light should so preserve vessels of earth, that
   they could not be broken. There was an excellency of power went along
   with it. And this is brought for a proof of it, that their spirits were
   sustained and upheld in defiance of surrounding troubles. Our spirits
   are not broken, we are still where we were, whatever assaults are made
   upon us from without This is that which the apostle says here, and is
   manifestly the design and scope of the words.

   And in these and the following words we have the apostle very curiously
   criticising about the degree of the afflictions, which he, and others
   in his circumstances were exposed to, or the extent and limits of them;
   that they reached so far, to a certain point or degree, but no further.
   And he makes, as you see, a fourfold distinction between trouble on
   every side, and distress; perplexity, and despair; persecution, and
   desertion; dejection, and destruction: yielding the former as to each
   of these, but denying the latter.

   And as to the passage which we have chosen to speak unto, "We are
   troubled on every side, yet not distressed:" we are to consider the
   subject, that is common to this, and all the rest; and then what is
   said about it by way of affirmation, and by way of negation.

   It is very true, this apostle doth more directly speak here of a
   particular subject; that is, of such persons as were intrusted with the
   ministry and dispensation of the gospel: "WE have this treasure in
   earthen vessels, WE are troubled on every side," &c. But yet the same
   persons were considerable too in a capacity, that was common to them
   with all other christians. And he speaks in that guise before, of
   something that must be understood as common to christians in general;
   and not appropriated to ministers only: and that is, the having the
   light to shine into their hearts; that "light of the knowledge of the
   glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ." This was not peculiar unto
   them alone. It having shone first into the minds and hearts of the
   apostles; from thence, as its instrument, this light was further
   conveyed, and transmitted unto others. We take "we" therefore in that
   more exclusive sense, or as it holds forth to us a larger subject;
   namely, Christians as such, who are so in sincerity and truth; and I
   would observe to you,

   That it is very possible to be encompassed with surrounding troubles,
   and yet at the same time not to be in distress. Or, if we take it with
   application to the subject; sincere christians, even then, when they
   are surrounded with troubles on every side, may yet be exempted from
   distress; may be troubled on every side, yet not distressed. And that
   this may be more distinctly spoken to, we are to consider,

   I. Of whom this is said.

   II. What it is that is said of them.

   III. Upon what grounds.

   IV. Make some use of the whole.

   I. We are to consider of whom this is said. I have already in general
   told you, that we may justly extend it to all christians that are
   sincere; that is, who are entirely such, and who faith fully persevere.

   1. To those, who are entirely such, or are christians through out: who
   do not content themselves with this, or that piece of religion: but
   have gotten the whole and entire frame of it. It is very possible, that
   the whole of religion may not, by these troubles on every side, be
   struck at all at once. But if a man be an entire christian, by the
   concurrence of all the integral parts which belong to such a character,
   it is likely that he will some time or other find himself troubled on
   every side; and yet may find himself also exempted from distress. The
   apostle tells us, that "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall
   suffer persecution." 2 Tim. iii. 12. It was possible to be a sober man,
   and a pious man (as piety went in the pagan world) and yet not be
   persecuted. But if a man would be a godly man in Jesus Christ; if he
   would add Christianity, in that state of things, and at that time, to
   his profession of piety; then, as if the apostle had said, let him look
   to it, he will be persecuted; and then he had need to look to this
   also, that he be not distressed.

   2. The true christian of whom we speak is also one that faithfully
   perseveres. Having been once an entire christian, by the concurrence of
   all that was requisite to make him so, he continues to be what once he
   was. Otherwise, by laying aside this or that piece of religion, when
   that comes to expose him to danger, the case would be altered. He
   neither would be exposed to affliction, nor so much need the support.
   If I did preach circumcision, says the apostle, when the doing of that
   was so great a salvo to a man, why should I then suffer persecution? I
   should then be liable to no trouble, the offence of the cross being
   ceased. Gal. v. 11. "It were" (as if he had said) "an easy matter for
   me to avoid the stroke, if I could wave such a particular piece of
   Christian truth, and such a part of Christian duty; as this very
   juncture of time did challenge my owning and asserting even to the
   utmost hazard. I were well enough if I could dispense in this matter:
   but because I cannot, the offence of the cross is not likely to cease;
   I shall have that in my way if I were apt to stumble at it."

   II. We are next to consider what it is that is here said of these
   persons. Something is said affirmatively, to shew the extent of the
   present affliction; and something negatively, to shew the limitation of
   it.

   1. That which is said by way of affirmation, and to shew how far the
   present affliction did extend is this; "We are troubled on every side."
   It reached so far as to give trouble on every side. Here we are to
   consider what sort of trouble that is, in respect of the nature of it;
   then in respect of the degree of it.

   ( I.) In respect of the nature of it, it is plain it was external
   trouble. The very word there used, thlibomenoi, signifieth dashing a
   thing from without. As the beating and allision of the waves against a
   rock make no trouble in the rock, no commotion there; but a great deal
   of noise, clamour and tumult round about it. That is the sort of
   trouble which that word in its primary signification holds forth to us;
   and which the circumstances of the text declare to be the signification
   of the thing here meant. And then we have next to consider,

   (2.) The degree of this same trouble; or what is intimated concerning
   it in the expression "on every side." It is very true indeed we are not
   necessitated, by the literal import of the expression, (panti) there
   used, to read it thus. We may as well read it, troubled in all things,
   troubled in all kinds, or at all times. The universal expression is
   capable of any of these additions, whereof there is none expressed in
   the text. It may therefore mean a great variety of those external
   troubles that we are liable to: such as we find the apostle making a
   distinct enumeration of pretty frequently; as in the 2 Cor. xi. 22. and
   onward, and so elsewhere. And also the expression may import the
   continuedness of such troubles running along with us in our course. We
   are always troubled, surrounded with trouble, always filled with it.
   "In every city, bonds and afflictions abide me," says St. Paul. This is
   said by way of affirmation, to shew the extent of this affliction. And
   then,

   2. By way of negation, to shew the limitations of this affliction, it
   is said that it did not arrive to distress. That is the thing denied of
   this subject. While trouble on every side is confessed, the apostle, I
   say, denies their being actually distressed on this account. And there
   the word used (stenochoroumenoi.) signifieth such a kind of straitening
   as doth infer a difficulty of drawing breath; that a man is so
   compressed that he cannot tell how to breathe: that is the native
   import of the word. As if he had said, We are not reduced to that
   extremity, by all the troubles that surround us; but we can breathe
   well enough for all that. Properly there are meant, by this thing
   denied, two degrees or steps of inward trouble. As

   (1.) That it is trouble that doth not reach the heart. For that is a
   distressing trouble which does so, which cuts and wounds the heart. But
   it does not touch there, as is the import of that expression in the 32
   Psalm, "In the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto
   him." Psal. xxxii. 6. That is strange that floods of waters should not
   come nigh unto him, when he is in the midst of them. No, they do not so
   invade his spirit as to affect that, they do not afflict his heart. And

   (2.) Here is denied (supposing such afflictions do reach the heart)
   that they so overwhelm as to constrain them to acknowledge, that they
   are distressed. If the waters should so flow in upon a man's soul that
   he could not breathe, that were a distress indeed. But the matter is
   not so. Either it is a trouble that reacheth not the heart; or if it
   doth, it does not oppress or overwhelm it. But now,

   III. We are to inquire concerning the grounds of this affirmation and
   negation; or how it comes to pass that such are troubled on every side,
   and yet not distressed.

   1. Let us inquire how it comes to pass, that true, sincere christians
   are troubled on every side; to keep to the expression in our
   translation. It is to be observed, that besides the permissive and
   disposing providence of the great Ruler of the church and the world,
   who for wise and holy ends permits, and orders such a state of things
   sometimes; besides this, I say, there are those proper inclinations in
   the persons immediately concerned, which directly reach the case. That
   is, there is somewhat in the disposition or temper of those, who are
   agents in this matter, or immediately work this surrounding trouble;
   and also in the patients, by which they are exposed, or do expose
   themselves to trouble on every side.

   As to the former, there needs no other account be given of it, but only
   the hate, the malignity of a wicked heart; that will be as mischievous
   to any more visible appearances of God, and his interest, as is
   possible. Therefore wicked men will create trouble on every side,
   because they are so wickedly bent.

   But then on the part of the patients, or suffering Christians, why are
   they so exposed? or why do they expose themselves, since the trouble
   that is on every side, upon the account of religion, might be avoided?
   To this we answer, that as the reason why others will create this
   trouble is from the corrupt malignity of their natures, so the reason
   why these do expose themselves to such trouble is from that new nature,
   that holy gracious nature, which is put into them, and superadded to
   what they naturally were before. We are to consider their religion as a
   thing, which is vitally united with them; that is, as it were,
   incorporated, and wrought into them, so as to make another sort of
   person in them from what there was before. For what a difference is
   there between the religion of one, who is not thorough, and in good
   earnest, in the business of Christianity, and one who is a christian
   indeed! To the former sort, religion is but as a sort of cloak. A man
   can easily lay aside his cloak if he finds it inconvenient, or a burden
   to him. It has no living union with himself; therefore it puts him to
   no pain or trouble at all to throw it away, if he finds thereby any
   inconvenience. But the religion of one that is truly and sincerely a
   christian, is a vital thing, and part of himself. And though a man can,
   easily part with his cloak, yet he cannot so easily part with his skin.
   That has a vital union with himself to which the spirit of life gives
   an animating power. And this is the case here. One that is only an
   overly outside professor hath put on a cloak of Christianity. If he
   finds that any prejudice is like to accrue to him upon this account, it
   is, I say, the easiest thing in the world for him to throw off his
   cloak. But one, who is a christian indeed, cannot do so. He cannot part
   with his religion. It is not as a cloak to him, but it is a piece of
   himself, and therefore he must be exposed. What will directly strike at
   such a man as he is, cannot be helped; for he cannot cease to be what
   he is. It is his very nature: that is, a new nature is put into him,
   which he cannot alter, or change and vary as he will; and therefore he
   must take what comes. But then again,

   2. We are to consider the ground of the negation; why such, though
   troubled on every side, are not distressed. And they are not so, partly
   upon the account of that gracious presence that is afforded to them;
   and partly because of those principles which are in them, that
   necessarily carry matter of solace and relief, so as to keep them from
   distress, notwithstanding their being surrounded with external
   troubles. There is, I say,

   (1.) A gracious presence afforded upon promise. "When thou passest
   through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they
   shall not overflow thee. When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt
   not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Isa. xliii.
   2. This is promised and made good, more or less, in a higher or lower
   degree, as to the divine wisdom and goodness seems most meet. He will
   never leave nor forsake such, whose hearts he hath determined to
   himself, and who adhere and cleave to him. He will not cast away the
   upright man. Such a one then is not like to be in distress when he hath
   God so present to him. It is but turning himself to him, and he hath
   him at hand. And,

   (2.) In subordination to the former, the very native tendency of the
   principles, which God has implanted in a holy soul, and which incline
   and dispose it towards him, are its great relief against every thing
   that tends to distress, or works that way. As for instance; faith,
   which adjoins the soul to God, interests it in his infinite fulness;
   when the soul must be far remote from straits or distress. Love too, is
   another principle by which the soul comes to have the actual fruition
   of that fulness, according to its measure; and what God doth now see
   meet, or fit, and suitable for it. There is patience also, by which the
   soul is composed; and brought into a perfect mastery and dominion over
   itself, so far as this gracious principle obtains. "By your patience
   possess ye your souls." You are outed of yourselves, if you be not
   patient; but if you be patient you enjoy yourselves. So that let the
   storm be never so great and boisterous without, there will be peace and
   calmness within. Patience is an ability to suffer. It is passive
   fortitude. He that can suffer, who is furnished with this ability, is
   in peace and quiet; is in no distress. He considers the case thus:
   "Such and such can afflict, and I can suffer; I am therefore in this
   respect on even terms with all the world. They can indeed lay upon me
   such and such things, and I can bear them through grace that helps me."
   If such be the temper of a christian that he cannot suffer, he must be
   a slave. Every such person must be subject to the power of those that
   can hurt him, or do him an ill turn; only because he can suffer
   nothing. He cannot suffer, therefore he must serve; or yield to every
   one's beck that hath any power to hurt him. But he that can suffer,
   hath the mastery over himself, and remains in self-possession. The
   other is outed of himself; and must resign his will, his judgment, his
   conscience, and every thing to the pleasure of another. Again, the
   principle of a good conscience also keeps a person from distress. When
   a man's own heart doth not reproach him, what can be distressing unto
   him? As Job said his should never do so, though he suffered, you know,
   very hard and grievous things. "My heart shall not reproach me so long
   as I live, till I die I will not remove my integrity from me." Job
   xxvii. 5, 6. Where such a disposition of spirit remains there can be no
   distress; no distress can ever fall there.

   IV. And now to make some brief use of this subject, we learn,

   1 How happy a good man is when no external trouble though it compass
   him on every side, is yet able to bring him into distress. Is not this
   man a happy man that can defy the world? that can stand in the face of
   storms unhurt, untouched, unshaken? The matter deserves our serious
   thoughts, that there should be such a privilege as this communicated
   unto mortality; unto a poor creature dwelling in mortal flesh. It gives
   us to see, that there is somewhat that greatens the spirit of such a
   one to that degree, as to make it too big for all this world. For what
   else is the reason, why such a one cannot be distressed? only because
   things apt to distress in their own nature, and in a subject more
   liable to it, are not able to compass, and entirely comprehend within
   themselves that spirit, which they would aim to distress. The spirit of
   a good man, as such, is too big for all this world; and if it have that
   grace in exercise, that is suitable to such a case, it is too big for
   this world entirely to compass. You cannot compress and straiten that
   which you cannot grasp. This world cannot grasp such a spirit. It is, I
   say, too big to be held within this narrow sphere. It looks above all
   sensible things. It is of too great a prospect to be confined in its
   apprehension of things, to time; it looks into a vast and boundless
   eternity. Therefore such a person cannot be distressed in his spirit.
   It surmounts the world, and is too great to be straitened by all the
   powers thereof, which can never reach unto it. Or if it should be
   brought into some very great trouble, it looks beyond this present
   troublous state of things. It looks into eternity, and says; "If it be
   not well now, it shall be. Things at present are not as I could wish,
   but they shall be as well as ever I could wish hereafter." In short you
   cannot confine the eye of such a one, but it will have a look at
   something beyond what is present and liable to common view. Therefore
   there is no way entirely to cut off relief from the spirit of a good
   man; for though it be troubled on every side, it is yet exempt from
   distress.

   2. Hence we see also the vast difference that there is between such a
   one, and a wicked, carnal man that knows not God; who is unacquainted
   with, and unrelated to him. Such persons, when external trouble comes
   upon them, are presently distressed, or are very liable to be so upon
   every occasion. They have not the way of escaping the pressure thereof,
   that holy gracious persons have. A person is not distressed so long as
   he hath some way of escape or other left. This is intimated by St. Paul
   himself, when he says; "There hath no temptation taken you, but such as
   is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be
   tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make
   a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." 1 Cor. x. 13. It is
   no strange thing that an affliction or trial should be borne, when
   there is a way of escape.

   But it may be said, Why is there any talk of bearing what I shall
   escape? I answer, it is plain that it is not escaping to suffer, that
   is there meant? but real hurt or damage by that suffering, so as to be
   not at all the worse for it, or prejudiced by it, at least in our
   spiritual concerns. It is such an escape as that, which our Saviour
   means in these words: "Watch and pray always, that ye may be counted
   worthy to escape the things that shall come to pass and to stand before
   the Son of Man." Luke xxi. 36. Not that they should escape suffering
   for he had been telling them before, what grievous things they should
   have to suffer; but that they should receive no hurt from their
   sufferings: that is, upon the whole matter they should have no cause to
   reckon themselves sufferers, inasmuch as no damage should accrue to
   them from thence.

   Now when a man hath a way of escape, he is not distressed; his state, I
   say, is not to be called a real distress. There is, at least upward,
   always a way of escape. David was sore distressed in Ziklag, after the
   Amalekites had invaded, and burnt it with fire and taken his people
   captive; yet it is said, that "he encouraged himself in his God." 1
   Sam. xxx. 6. He looked upward, and had a way of escape or deliverance
   open to him from above.

   But it is however said there, that he "was greatly distressed." I
   answer it is very true, and so any good man may be in a great degree
   distressed, as well as David. Thus the apostle Paul speaking of the
   impossibility of working any separation between him and Christ, and
   intimating that nothing could force him out of the arms of his love;
   not even persecution, or tribulation, nor famine nor the sword;
   mentions distress also as the supposed lot of good men. Rom. viii. 35.
   But we must understand however only by this, that something may befall
   a good man which is apt to distress; but is not actually distressing,
   at least to that degree as to allow no way of escape. Then indeed a man
   would be in real distress, if that were true of him, which his enemies
   said of David; "Many there be which say of my soul, there is no help
   for him in God." Psalm iii. 2. But this is not the case; there is no
   state in which a good man may be, wherein there remains no help for him
   in God.

   It was indeed a distressing case, which you find Saul was in, when he
   had caused Samuel, or somewhat that appeared like to him, to be called
   up; who said unto him, "Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?"
   To whom Saul answered, I am sore distressed, for the Philistines make
   war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more.
   1 Sam. xxviii. 15. This was a grievous distress indeed: there was great
   trouble from without, and God was gone. Here then is the vastly
   different state of a wicked wretch, from that of a godly man under
   affliction in a time of trouble, and when distress is n every side; God
   is gone! God is afar off! Besides such a one has no disposition to take
   the way that leads to God. Thus Elihu speaking of such distressed
   wicked men, says; "By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry;
   they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. But none saith, Where
   is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night?" Job xxxv. 9, 10. They
   lie groveling, and groaning, ready to expire away under their burden;
   but it never comes into their mind, to inquire after God, saying, Where
   is our God? This is a thing unthought of, and therefore theirs is a
   most distressed state and condition; having no shift left them, nor
   knowing what to do. But there is always this shift left to a pious
   soul, if there be nothing else, namely, to look up. "We know not what
   to do," says Jehoshaphat, "but our eyes are up to thee." 2 Chron. xx.
   12. But when a man hath simply nothing to do, no prospect of relief,
   then the case is very forlorn; and this, at length, will be the case of
   all wicked men. We may easily guess, that they have nothing left to do,
   who cry to rocks and mountains to fall upon them. This speaks plain
   desperateness; and yet this will be the case one day with those, who
   find not out in due season, the way of being exempted from distress.
   Then there will be a great deal of trouble on every side, when the
   world will be all in flames; and then it must certainly be distress.
   There will be, as our Lord informs us, (Luke xxi. 25, &c.) distress of
   nations with perplexity; the seas and the waves roaring; men's hearts
   failing them for fear, and for looking after those things that are
   coming upon the earth: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken,
   when we shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and
   great glory; and when the cry shall go forth, "Lo he is come, behold
   his sign in the heavens!" Consider then how we are concerned to make
   sure of his favour, and to hasten to get into that state; wherein,
   though for a while we may not be exempted from trouble, yet we shall
   from distress: I mean from that distress for which there is no remedy,
   which can admit of no relief.

   I thought to have propounded something by way of counsel, in order to
   such a course as this. As,

   (1.) Labour to be disengaged from all terrene things, the things of
   this world. If there our life is bound up, if we are troubled there on
   every side, we cannot but be distressed. But if the world be crucified
   to us, and we to the world, there can be no distress; the troubles of
   it cannot be distressing to us. Dead things cannot feel, cannot afflict
   one another. Let us say then, "The world is dead to me, and I am dead
   to it; we are crucified one to another." The dead can lie quietly one
   by another, without giving mutual wounds. And then too,

   (2.) Draw nigh to God, that large and boundless good, in whom all
   fulness is. Of them that fear him it is said, "their souls shall dwell
   at ease." Ps. xxv. 13. The expression in the original, is, "Their souls
   shall lodge, or rest in goodness;" for the word there aptly signifies
   the quiet rest of the night. We must then draw nigh to God; and stick
   close to him in trust, confidence, love, obedience, subjection, and by
   a continual daily course of prayer. For they who are given much to pray
   will feel little of distress, in comparison of what they are else
   liable to. The Psalmist speaks of enemies, who were continually
   designing evil to him. "For my love," says he, they are mine
   adversaries, but I give myself unto prayer." Ps. cix. 4. If there be
   any design against me, if my enemies are aiming at me, "I prayer;" for
   so the expression is in the Hebrew text: that is, I betake myself to
   prayer, my known and usual resort, and then I fare well. Thus, in so
   doing, you will find your soul to dwell at ease, and rest in the
   goodness of God. A wicked man, in the midst of his sufficiency is full
   of straits; you, in the midst of straits will be in the fountain of
   all-sufficiency, and have the all-flowing goodness streaming on every
   side. And in such a course you may come to experience what is here said
   by the apostle, so as no longer to look upon this as a paradox, but as
   that which your hearts can witness to; namely, that though trouble be
   on every side, yet thanks be to God, we find no distress.

SERMON III. [77]

   James i. 2.

   My Brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.

   I TAKE It for granted that by temptations here, we are to understand
   afflictions; such as are, for trial's sake, laid upon the people of
   God. And whereas such, namely, those to whom the compellation of
   brethren is agreeable, are enjoined to count such afflictions matter of
   all joy; this plainly implies, that to such persons they are so. For
   they are not surely enjoined to judge otherwise of the matter than it
   really is, nor directed to make a false judgment of things. Therefore
   the truth I have to insist upon you may take briefly thus;

   That the afflictions laid upon Christians, for the sake of trial, are
   to a right and spiritual judgment the matter of joy; even of all joy,
   as you have it here expressed.

   Now that this truth may be capable of use (which is the main thing I
   design upon it) it is necessary that I do these two things in the
   general; namely,

   I. That I state this truth: and then,

   II. Give you the grounds of it.

   I. I shall state this truth, or shew you how it is to be taken and
   understood. And here we have two things to open to you; namely, the
   object of that judgment, which is here directed to be made, and then
   the nature of it. The opening of these two things concerning the
   judgment we are to make of afflictions, which good men are exercised
   withall, will take up the whole of the business that is needful by way
   of explication; so as that you may have the distinct state of the
   matter before you.

   I. I shall consider the object of the judgment here to be made; that
   is, the truth of this proposition, that afflictions laid upon us for
   the sake of trial are matter of joy. And this is the thing to be
   judged; as indeed in any proper act of judgment, a proposition is still
   the object; wherein one thing is affirmed, or denied of another. And
   the truth of this proposition is the thing to be judged; that
   afflictions, such afflictions or temptations as the apostle speaks of,
   are really matter of joy. There fore it is necessary that we open to
   you this proposition as the object of the judgment here to be made.
   Particularly that we,--consider what is supposed here to be matter of
   joy; namely, afflictions, for the sake of trial: then--we shall open to
   you that which is affirmed, or supposed, concerning temptations;
   namely, that they are matter of joy: and--then the manner of the
   agreement of the one of these, to the other.

   (1.) Let us consider what it is that is supposed by the apostle to be
   matter of joy; namely, temptations, or afflictions for trial's sake.
   Not any man's afflictions, but those that befall a christian; not any
   afflictions of a christian neither, but those which are laid upon him
   for the sake of trial, as the word (peirasmois,) used in the text doth
   plainly import. For t one very well known, and very useful and
   necessary distinction of afflictions, that they are either corrective,
   even unto the people of God; or else tentative. This is not a
   distinction of afflictions considered in their natures, but taken from
   the end thereof: for in their natures they may be the very same, as the
   afflictions of good men and bad men may be.

   Divers temptations are mentioned: which implieth not only multitude, as
   to number; but variety, as to kind. There may be the same kinds of them
   inflicted, for either the one or other of those ends. So that the
   distinction I mention to you is not of their natures, but it is taken
   from something extrinsical; as the end of any thing is extrinsical to
   the thing itself. God doth sometimes lay on afflictions to try, and
   sometimes to correct or chastise his people. The principle of those
   afflictions, that are for the sake of correction, is displeasure and
   paternal justice; which God doth exercise upon his own family, and
   among his own children. And they have been wont, as indeed they ought,
   so to understand the matter. Thus says the prophet Micah, in the name
   of the people; "I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have
   sinned against him." Micah vii. 9. And his anger is sometimes said to
   smoke, and continue long to do so; as several expressions in Scripture,
   that I might turn to, import. But when the afflictions are to try, the
   principle thereof is not displeasure; but wisdom, and sovereign good
   pleasure. In this case, I say, they are to be resolved into wise and
   holy sovereignty; not anger, as their principle.

   Now it is concerning afflictions so designed, or directed to this end,
   namely, for trial, that the attribute here in the text must be
   understood; that is, that they are matter of all joy, and are to be so
   accounted. And because we must take the state of the subject, so as to
   understand the apostle speaking not of punitive, but tentative
   afflictions, as such; therefore we are a little more concerned to
   inquire in every case, how we may be able to discern when any
   affliction, or series of afflictions, are brought upon the people of
   God, or upon a particular person, for the sake of trial. For the stress
   of the whole business lies upon the right understanding of this matter,
   and is the main thing we have to do in stating of the truth before us.

   In order to it therefore, you must know that though these two notions
   of afflictions, to wit, corrective and tentative, are very distinct;
   yet we are not to suppose that they are always to be separated. It is
   very possible that an affliction, or a state of affliction, may come
   upon a good man for both these ends at once; but it is impossible that
   both these ends should, at any time, be principal. When both these ends
   do fall in together, so that afflictions are sent both to correct and
   also to try; yet still one of them only is the principal end, and it is
   from thence that the denomination is to be taken. As for instance; that
   affliction is to be called tentative, or that state of affliction is to
   bear the name of temptation or trial, when this appears to be the chief
   end, which God designed and aimed at, in ordering such a state of
   things to be the lot of his people, or of this or that person. But when
   the principal end appears to be their chastisement, then they are to be
   accounted corrective afflictive; or punishments, and judgments, as
   these expressions are also used with respect to the people of God. But
   yet it may be said, "How shall we know which end is principal, when an
   afflictive condition comes to be the lot of any of God's people?"

   This case cannot be very distinctly and particularly spoken to now, for
   that would take up all our time. I shall only say this one thing to it
   at present, which is very plain and clear; and I doubt not satisfactory
   to every one, that seriously attends to it. When the people of God, who
   are in a state of affliction, have been and still are in a declension,
   as to matters of religion; or when this and that person can reflect,
   that they have been guilty of some very great enormity, some more
   notable transgression, and an affliction befalls them: why, truly, in
   this case they have all the reason in the world to look upon this
   affliction as punitive; that is, as principally designed for
   correction. But if the state of the church of God, when such an
   afflicted condition falls out to be their lot, is spiritually good;
   that is, if they have been for some time in a better condition than
   ordinary, or under no very observable delinquency and decay in their
   spiritual state; then the course of afflictions, which they at such a
   time fall under, is chiefly tentative; or to be reckoned as sent
   principally for the sake of trial.

   And truly if we look into the afflictions which befell the people of
   God in common, at different ages, you will find, by what you have
   recorded in the Old Testament, concerning the church in those days
   (which consisted of the Jews for the most part) that miseries always
   befell them, when they were in a state of apostacy from God, or some
   more notable defection; which therefore constantly passed under the
   notion of corrections, or chastisements and punishments, upon that
   account. But as to what we find recorded of the sufferings of the
   church of God in the New Testament (which you know gives us an account
   only of a small space of time) those afflictions and sufferings befell
   good men, at a time when the church of God was in its best state; and
   when there was most of the vigour, the power and spirit of religion,
   that ever was known. Therefore we have most reason to look upon the
   afflictions, that befell them, as designedly tentative; whereupon it is
   that you have afflictions more usually spoken of, in the New Testament,
   under the notion of trials and temptations.

   So that this is a short and summary account that I give you of this
   matter: afflictions befall persons for correction, when they are in
   their worst state; for trial, when they are in their best. And now you
   have the state of the subject (as far as it is necessary) cleared up to
   you. But concerning afflictions it is said, when it is discernible that
   they are principally tentative, that they are to be accounted matter of
   all joy. And

   (2.) This is the thing spoken of this subject, which we are now to
   speak to; we are to reckon these afflictions joy, all joy. We shall
   need to say but little here. This joy, if we take in the term all with
   it especially, includeth these two things; to wit complacency, and
   gloriation: a being well pleased with these afflictions, and also a
   visible glorying upon such an account. It is true indeed these things
   are wont to be expressed by two different words, (Chara, and
   Agalliasis) whereas we have but one in the text. You have them put
   together by our Saviour when he pronounces blessedness on them who
   suffer persecution for righteousness sake; "Rejoice" (says he) "and be
   exceeding glad." Matt. v. 10, 11, 12. There is inward pleasure, an
   inward sense of pleasure, and a certain kind of triumph, that appear
   and shew forth themselves in conjunction. And when it is said, that we
   are to account it all joy when we fall into such temptations, it
   implies, that we are to comprehend both these together in the sense of
   the expression. In which expression, we are indeed to understand joy
   objectively, as is usual, and so very obvious that I need not hint it
   to you; not, I say, the act, but the matter of joy, as we before
   explained it to you.

   (3.) We have further to consider, concerning this proposition, the
   agreement of the object, with the subject of it. How comes it to be
   truly said of afflictions that they are matter of all joy? How do these
   agree together? It is very plain it is not a natural agreement; it is
   no agreement arising from any affinity that these afflictions have, in
   their own nature, unto joy. Nothing more remote than affliction, and
   joy. Affliction "for the present is not joyous, but grievous."
   Therefore that which connects them must be something extrinsical;
   somewhat which God puts in the case, so as wholly to alter it from what
   it would else be in its natural state. But this we shall have occasion
   to shew by and by, when we speak to the grounds of it, which we are to
   come to presently.

   2. Having considered the object, we are now to consider the nature of
   this judgment. The apostle bids us so to account such affliction, as we
   have considered, all joy, as that this may be a fixed kind of judgment
   with us; for so the word egesasthe, signifies. I shall particularly say
   but these two things about it:

   (I.) That it must be a judgment spiritually enlightened: a judgment
   that is irradiated by a divine light shining upon it, by which the
   truth of the thing might be discerned; which otherwise would go for a
   paradox, and that the most incredible one that ever was heard of. It
   must be a heavenly divine light, which must inform that judgment that
   shall be able to discern the truth here asserted, that these trying
   afflictions are matter of joy. And

   (2.) It must be a judgment spiritually actuated and enlivened that so
   it may become a practical judgment. By the former means it comes to be
   a clear judgment, when divine light once shines in the mind, so as that
   the truth of this matter appears very clear; by the latter means it
   comes to be a practical judgment, that is, such as is impressive of a
   proportionable correspondent frame of heart, which is that which the
   apostle chiefly intends here. For it would do persons but little good,
   to have such a notion only hovering in their minds concerning
   afflictions, that they are matter of joy; this would be but a cold
   business. The word count here in the text, is taken from the word
   egemonikon, from whence that phrase is taken, which is expressive of
   the leading faculty and power of the soul. But there is nothing
   leading, where nothing follows; the one implies the other. It is
   therefore implied here, that this must be such a judgment as commands
   what is duly and properly the subject of it, and what ought to be
   commanded; namely, the heart, and will, and affections of the soul. It
   implies that a person willingly bear a temper of spirit, proportionable
   to this judgment; that is, maintain a holy cheerfulness and vigour, and
   liveliness of spirit, through the whole course of such an afflicted
   state, as may happen to be his lot. Such a judgment it is that being
   enlightened from above is in some measure clear, and does not suffer us
   to be always in the dark, puzzled and entangled in our thoughts about
   the matter. In a word, it is a judgment that being actuated by a divine
   power ought to be practical, proportionable and conformable to itself;
   that so we may carry ourselves in a state of affliction, as though we
   judged in this case, that it is matter of great joy that we are brought
   into such a condition as this.

   Thus now you have the state of the truth in reference to the things
   propounded to be opened, concerning the subject spoken of; and
   particularly the nature of the judgment that is to be made concerning
   the afflictions that befall good men: which as I have shewn, must be
   spiritually enlightened, and so spiritually enlightened as to be a
   practical principle in the soul.

   II. I now proceed to the next genera! head to be spoken to, after
   having stated this truth; and that is to give you the grounds of it.
   What should be the ground of this, that to a true judgment such
   afflictions as these are should be matter of joy? I can but just touch
   at what requires to be largely insisted upon. In general, if this be
   our case, that we are christians exercised with tentative afflictions,
   we are to count them all joy, if we would judge rationally and
   prudently; both upon God's account, and our own

   1. On God's account; and you have no reason to think it strange, that
   this should be alleged as a ground of a christian's rejoicing in
   temptations. For God and good men are no such strangers to one another,
   but that wherein his interest is concerned and advantaged, they have
   real matter of joy. both upon the account of their relation to him, and
   the determination of their spirits towards him, and his interest. Now
   his interest is manifestly concerned to great advantage in this case;
   and by this means it hath always been promoted, and his glory hath
   shone forth illustriously through the trials that have befallen his
   people.

   If we speak of the glory of God, which is capable of being given to
   him; which cannot be the glory that is essential to his being, but his
   extrinsical, or adventitious glory, it may be said to lie in these two
   things: namely, in the display thereof, and in the agnition and
   acknowledgement of his glory upon that display. That is all we can make
   of glorifying God, and of his being glorified in the world: that there
   is a lustre shineth forth, or a visible glorious representation of him
   made; and then, that this be acknowledged, or taken notice of, and he
   be confessed hereupon to be glorious. Why both these are concerned,
   whenever it falls out to be the lot of his people to be exercised with
   tentative afflictions.

   (1.) There is a most visible display of his glory in this case; to wit,
   the glory of his power, of his wisdom, of his goodness, of his
   faithfulness and truth, both in sustaining and delivering his afflicted
   ones. There is a spirit of glory resting upon them in such a time and
   state as that is. "If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy
   are ye." 1 Pet. iv. 14. Men cast upon you reproach, God puts a glory
   upon you; for, as St. Peter expresses it, "the Spirit of glory and of
   God resteth upon you:" it stays and abides with you, and hath a fixed
   settled residence upon you. Agreeable hereunto is the tenor of that
   prayer of St. Paul for the Colossians: "That ye might be strengthened
   with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience, and
   long-suffering, with joyfulness; giving thanks unto the Father, who
   hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in
   light." Colos. i. 11, 12. Here is a very great display of the divine
   glory in this case. And,

   (2.) The agnition or acknowledgement thereof is wont to ensue, which is
   the other thing considerable in God's being glorified. Such as feel
   supports from God in their afflictions, do highly magnify him in their
   spirits; yea and many times his glory is acknowledged by afflicting
   enemies themselves. They are made to confess that they have to do with
   somewhat they cannot master, a spirit that is too hard for them, even
   an invincible spirit. They are made to own and confess that greater is
   he that is in the sufferers, than he that is in this world.

   I have sometimes taken notice in the histories of former times,
   concerning the persecutions that befell the people of God more than
   once, that this expression hath been used in those cases, "The devil is
   in them;" that is, a more than an ordinary spirit. They could not but
   believe it was somewhat more than the spirit of a man, that supported
   them; but if they called it by any other name they must have reproached
   themselves, and acknowledged that they were fighters against God.
   However they could not but have a secret conviction, (and it appears
   sometimes they had so) that it was an almighty Spirit they were
   fighting against, when they were dealing with the people of God in this
   kind.

   This then is the ground of joy to the patients themselves, that though
   they suffer, yet God is glorified. His glory shineth through all the
   clouds and darkness that involve them, and wherein they are inwrapt.
   The apostle speaks as if he did not care what became of him, so that
   Christ might be but magnified by him, living or dying. Phil. i. 20.

   2. I now come to shew that good men, exercised with such afflictions as
   the apostle speaks of, ought to rejoice in them on their own account;
   not only because of the glory that redounds to God thereby, but also
   because of the advantage that accrues to themselves; which is twofold,
   namely reputative, and real.

   (1.) A reputative advantage accrues to them from hence: for it is an
   honour and dignity put upon them to be called to suffer on this
   account, that is, for the sake of trial. As I remember, a heathen
   moralist says, "A soldier who is one of the number selected or picked
   out to go upon some very hazardous enterprize, if he be one of true
   fortitude and real valour, he will not say "Imperator de me male
   meruit, sed bene judicavit. My general discovers a good opinion of me,
   and so he puts the honour of such a service upon me." So when God
   thinks fit to exercise his people in a way of trial, he puts an honour
   upon them, saying; "Come forth, now you shall be my champions, you
   shall be the butts and marks against which all the power and malice of
   devils and men shall be directed, and yet I will make you stand." A
   poor bruised reed, God is able to make to stand, as in another case is
   said concerning a weak christian. A reed that is bruised, and hangs its
   head, is capable of being made to stand against all the storms and rage
   of earth and hell. "You," as if he had said, "are some of my
   instruments, which I will make use of to baffle hell and all the powers
   of darkness. I will make them, even by you confess themselves outdone."

   Here then is a great reputative advantage, an honour and dignity put
   upon good men, to come forth as God's own champions; to contend on his
   behalf against every adversary and power in a way of affliction: that
   so they may overcome them by the blood of Jesus and the word of his
   testimony, not loving their lives even to the death. This is some of
   the honour of these saints of God. And if it had not been accounted so
   in former days, we should not have had, among the writings of some of
   the antients, consolations writ purposely to them who missed of
   martyrdom; whose lot it was to be delivered, and not to fall as
   martyrs, in the common day of trial. And then,

   (2.) There is a real advantage accruing from afflictions or temptations
   of this nature, both present and eternal. They that are exercised with
   them get great advantage by them at present, and foresee that they are
   like to do so hereafter; as is instanced in one particular in the words
   immediately following my text. "My brethren count it all joy when ye
   fall into divers temptations; knowing that the trying of your faith
   worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may
   be perfect and entire, wanting nothing." James i. 2, 3, 4. So that at
   the long run they tend to their consummation and perfection. But first
   it is said, "knowing that the trial of your faith worketh patience;"
   which carries this intimation along with it, that this one single
   advantage or gain by the trial of faith, even the grace of patience,
   countervails all evils what ever which such trials can bring upon them.

   And certainly it is so, if it be considered what a heaven patience
   carrieth in it; namely, that meekness, that subjection to the Father of
   spirits, that complacency in his will, that holy fortitude and
   greatness of mind, which, I say, patience carries in itself. So that if
   a man had lost all that ever he had in the world, and got patience, he
   is a great gainer. Such a one is refined, and purged, and shines so
   much the more gloriously, as a star in the higher region, or the upper
   firmament. But this is only a leading thing to the universal gain,
   which they, who are spiritual, have in other respects; for upon this
   improvement of patience the whole inward man partakes of so much more
   strength, vigour, sprightliness and activity. Spiritual strength and
   soundness are thereby throughout promoted; so that they have great
   reason to glory with respect to the present gain and advantage,
   accruing from their afflictions.

   And then with respect to hereafter, what matter of joy and glory to
   think how all will be compensated to them in the other world! The
   "light afflictions, which are but for a moment, work out for them a far
   more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." If we suffer with Christ,
   we shall be also glorified together; "for I reckon," says the apostle,
   (this is the computation I make) "that the sufferings of this present
   time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be
   revealed." These are things not to be mentioned the same day, one" with
   the other, for there is no comparison between them.

   Therefore you see how it is that this same joy doth guide itself, and
   which way the eye of the soul is directed to the exercise of it: not to
   pore upon afflictions alone, but to consider them as subservient to
   glory. Thus says the apostle, "We rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
   And then it presently follows too, "We rejoice in tribulations also;"
   that is, considered with and in their subserviency to future glory. And
   this it is that makes them the matter of the highest joy.

   But I would say something by Way of Use, though the time hath almost
   overslipt me. Sundry things might be inferred from hence, which I shall
   but name to you.

   1. Since this judgment, and the temper of spirit agreeable thereto, are
   peculiar to the case of trials or tentative affliction, they must be
   necessarily otherwise where afflictions are visibly punitive, and
   principally of a chastising nature. As this judgment, namely to count
   them all joy, answers the one case; so truly deep humiliation cannot
   but answer the other; even very deep humiliation, abasing one's self
   and lying low, and owning that the holy, righteous, jealous God is
   punishing them for the evil they have done. For in this case he is
   dealing with his children another way; he is not arraying them with
   glory, but clothing them with shame, before all the world. And
   therefore it is a season for them to be deeply humbled whenever that
   appears to be their stated case. Though to such persons there may be a
   mixture of pleasure, arising from the hope that God will bring such a
   state out of it (out of their sin and suffering) as shall turn into
   matter of joy afterwards. But the occasion of joy in such a case is
   more occult, and remote; and is wrapt up in a great deal more visible
   matter of sorrow, shame and humiliation, when it appears that an
   afflicted state is brought upon them purposely for punishment and
   rebuke. And again,

   2. We may infer hence, that mere patience is not enough for christians
   under trying afflictions. It is not sufficient to be merely patient;
   they are to account their condition all joy. Therefore the apostle
   prays that more patience might be granted to the Colossians, in the
   place mentioned before; that they might suffer with joyfulness, and
   give thanks to him who had made them meet to be partakers of the
   inheritance of the saints in light. Col. i. 10-14. He writes there to
   such as were likely to meet with, or to have very little of any earthly
   inheritance; rather to lose what they had, for the sake of Christ: and
   he intimates that it was not enough for them to be merely content, or
   patient under such a loss, but it was suitable to their state to be in
   a high triumph and exultation of spirit upon this account; because God
   was thereby making them meet for another inheritance with the saints in
   light. Those christians do not quit themselves well, nor as becomes
   them, who do only not murmur or repine that they are tried by
   afflictions: for the thing to be aimed at, in the-midst of all such
   exercises, is to thank God, and rejoice in the thoughts of what they
   are to enjoy; namely, an inheritance with the saints in their pure,
   lightsome, peaceful, blissful regions. "What an inheritance have I
   above! Blessed be God, though I lose all I have in this world, while he
   is making me meet for such an inheritance; and makes it evident he hath
   such a design in hand as this upon me!"

   3. We learn too, that to be impatient and repining upon the account of
   afflictions, is greatly intolerable. To be patient merely, is not
   enough; to be impatient, is simplicity, folly, and sin. It is
   intolerable that we should think we are ill dealt with, when we are
   exercised with such afflictions as are designed only for the sake of
   trial. But I cannot stay on this head.

   4. We learn, that joy is most exceedingly connatural to true living
   religion. There cannot be a greater demonstration of it than this, that
   there can be no state, externally so bad, that can make their joy
   unseasonable; or that can make it an incongruous, or unfitting thing
   for them to rejoice. To have a disposition unto spiritual and heavenly
   joy is a thing very intimate to the constitution of a true christian.
   That must needs be a very strong, predominant, prevailing principle in
   any thing, which converts and turns that which is of an opposite nature
   into nutriment to itself; such is the joy as can even feed upon, and
   maintain itself out of afflictions. God's people can rejoice, not only
   notwithstanding they are afflicted, but because they are so afflicted.
   The divers temptations they are exercised with are counted the matter
   of their joy. And we may yet further infer hence,

   5. That there is something very peculiar in living true Christianity.
   For how odd a sound doth this carry to an unchristian ear, and how
   uncouth a taste to an unchristian heart, that afflictions are to be
   made, and accounted matter of joy. But it is past all doubt that there
   is a real truth in the matter. We find that it hath been so; and that
   this is not a mere notion that hovers in the air, but is a practical
   thing, and has been a tried case. Do not we read of the apostles'
   rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of
   Christ? Acts v. 41. This was not only so in their account, but was
   really so. So we are told of the believing Hebrews, that they took
   joyfully the spoiling of their goods. Heb. x. 34. What! for a man to
   rejoice to be undone? A strange paradox that any, who was not seriously
   a christian, should count this matter of joy! Therefore true
   Christianity hath somewhat peculiar to itself be longing to it. It is a
   very extraordinary thing, which lies without the compass and
   comprehension of all, who do not experimentally know it.

   Before I close, there are two things I would say to you by way of
   counsel.

   1. Labour to fix this judgment in general upon your minds. Let it not
   seem to you as an uncouth incredible thing. It is a most certain truth,
   that afflictions in some cases may most reasonably be matter of joy. It
   is a sad thing when we cannot obtain so much of ourselves as to receive
   this notion, and to believe the truth of what is here implied. For when
   we are bid to count so, it is implied that it is really so; that is,
   that afflictions in such a case, namely, for the sake of trial, are
   matter of joy. But our spirits boggle at this; we cannot tell how to
   receive, or entertain it. And then,

   2. Endeavour that it may be your judgment with application to
   yourselves and your own state and case. And we must here take notice to
   you of what is in itself most obvious, that when we are directed to
   count it all joy when we fall into divers temptations, we are also
   directed to do whatever is necessarily presupposed hereunto. It is
   never to be imagined or thought, that one who lives in sin; who is a
   secure, carnal, earthly-minded creature, and a stranger to God and
   heaven, if any affliction should come upon him, that he must off-hand
   count it a matter of joy. No there is something must intervene. What
   then is it we should apply ourselves to? Why to endeavour to get into a
   safe state of soul, and that things may be so with us Godward, that if
   eve;; it come to be our case to be afflicted we maybe able to pass this
   judgment, so clear and satisfied as to impress the heart, that
   afflictions are to be counted all joy and in such a case may actually
   ourselves rejoice.

   I Thought to have insisted on sundry things here, but have not time.
   Yet I must observe, that to get our states clear with respect to God,
   and to keep and maintain our consciences both clean and quiet, are
   necessary to such a happy state as to be able to rejoice in adversity.
   Then we shall suffer without grudging, and with rejoicing for the sake
   of Christ. How impossible is it ever to rejoice in an afflicted
   condition, till we have hearts brought under the power of a
   self-denying spirit; till we are mortified to this world, and our
   spirits loosened and disengaged from every thing terrene! The man whose
   heart cleaveth to this earth; who is taken with an ample estate, an
   opulent trade, a neat habitation, all desirable comforts and
   accommodation: the man, I say, who is so taken up with these things
   that his life his bound up in them, cannot endure the thought, upon any
   terms, of suffering in these kinds; it is death to him to think of it.
   But if a man's spirit be once divested of an earthly frame, and can
   tell how to digest the thoughts of being undone, he may rejoice, and
   say; "What am I, that I may not be undone? have not many as good as I
   been undone? who had as good an estate, lived in as good credit in the
   world? Why may not I be poor, come into straits, be destitute of
   friends, and exposed to wants as well as others?" When a man by
   familiar converse with these objects hath reconciled his spirits to
   them, so that he can digest these things, then he is in a way to
   rejoice in such a case, when it comes to be his, and is able to say;
   "Blessed be God that I had an estate to sacrifice for Christ! that I
   had liberty, and have still a life to sacrifice for him, whenever he
   calls for it." If we did but thus labour be forehand to inure ourselves
   to such thoughts as these; if we did but put the case frequently and
   make the supposition familiar to ourselves, "What if we were to live in
   a wilderness? dwell in a cave of the earth? What if we were to go up
   and down helpless, living upon providence for daily bread?" When we
   had, I say, used ourselves to think thus, and made the matter familiar
   to ourselves we might if it should come to be really our case, or God
   should put us upon the trial, turn it into a matter of triumph and
   great joy.

   And so likewise it is highly necessary to live much in heaven, and to
   realize that state to ourselves; not to make it as a strange country,
   but this state rather in which we are. To a man that is abroad in some
   foreign country, which is full of war, trouble, and blood, it is some
   comfort to him (if he be certain of a way of return) to think, "Well! I
   am not to stay here long in this troublesome country; I know how to get
   home, to mine own house in a peaceful country; I shall find all quiet
   there." How pleasant a thought I say is this, especially if a man is
   sure of a return! In this case he may be sure, and a christian may say,
   "My own country is a quiet country; there will be nothing but peace,
   rest, pleasures and delights to people of God. Here indeed I do not
   intend to abide. I do not expect to stay long here this is not my
   country." Oh, to be here as in a strange country, and to look upon that
   other, namely heaven, as our own; will make it possible to us not only
   to despise, but even to rejoice in what we meet withall that is
   troublesome in this world, because it is part of our way home. It is
   indeed a dirty way, but it is our way notwithstanding to our better
   country.

   I would enforce all that has been said by a consideration or two, and
   so conclude.

   1. Think with yourselves how pleasant it is to have spirits got into
   this frame and posture, that we can really count it matter of joy to
   fall into afflictions. Oh think, I say, how pleasant it is! For how
   happy are those persons, who when they have a prospect of great evils
   before them, are yet not afraid of them? and certainly we shall not be
   afraid of that, which we have an actual disposition to rejoice in. In
   such a case we shall be under the pressure of no very tormenting fear.
   "They that hearken to me" (saith Wisdom) "shall dwell safely, and shall
   be quiet from the fear of evil." Prov. i. 33. He that has got to this
   pitch, who can count it all joy to fall into divers temptations, is
   arrived already to a safe dwelling: he hath so hid himself in the
   divine presence, that he is secure from the fear of evil. No evil can
   ever reach him. And consider again,

   2. That this is the only way we have to make any good or advantage of a
   matter, that is bad in itself and in its own nature. For let us a
   little recount ourselves. I believe there are few among us, if any,
   that have not some prospect, more or less, of troublesome days a
   coming; a very afflictive condition. Pray what shall we do in this
   case, if we will not do those things that tend to bring us into a
   capacity of making this judgment our own, in reference to our own
   concernments? What have we else to do? Would we busy our thoughts how
   any such condition shall be prevented? Shall that be our concern? Shall
   we try if we can stop the sun, or alter the course of the stars? Do we
   think to change the external posture of the world? That is, alas! a
   hopeless thought, a vain attempt.

   But we have a nearer and a possible thing to do, namely, to get the
   temper of our own spirits altered; brought off from this world; pitched
   upon another, and a better world. We have no other course to take. Let
   us then drive the nail that will go. We have hopes that we may alter
   our spirits if we will employ our power so to do, but we cannot change
   the times and the seasons. That is our province and business. We have
   work to do here. We have a superintendency over our own spirits; here
   we are authorized; God puts us upon it to see to our own spirits, that
   if they be earthly, we may endeavour to get them made heavenly; if
   impure, holy; if dead, lively; if vain, serious. This is our own proper
   business. So that as our case is, our circumstances are. We cannot hope
   to avoid suffering, our business therefore is to avoid suffering
   uncomfortably; this, I say, is our great business. To avoid suffering
   we cannot reasonably hope, though we should resolve to make shipwreck
   of faith, and a good conscience. For do we think, that all such persons
   that do so are secure from suffering? It is a remarkable passage from
   Scripture we have in St. Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians.
   "There hath no temptation befallen you, but such as is common to men."
   That is one consideration. Another is, "But God is faithful, who will
   not suffer you to be tempted, above what you are able, &c." 1 Cor. x.
   13. It is the former I would now speak to: "No temptation hath befallen
   you, but such as is common to men." As if he had said: You are liable
   to afflictions as you are men, not merely as you are Christians: so
   that you cannot certainly save yourselves from them, though you should
   abjure your Christianity. For what can a man be safe from, that is
   common to man? These afflictions follow humanity. Are christians the
   only men that are poor? that are crossed? or in a prison? If a man be a
   man (reckon only so) he is liable on that account to these things.
   Therefore, I say, since we have n way in the world to secure us from
   suffering, our great concern is to labour that we may suffer in the
   most comfortable way we can: so as that when it comes to be our lot, we
   may be capable of counting it all joy. And then we are a thousand times
   upon better terms, than if we were sure never to feel affliction: for
   that is only an external good; but the other is a spiritual good. And
   these are to be estimated according to the capacity and condition of
   the subject. I hope my flesh, my body, is not capable of so much hurt,
   as my spirit is of good. To be freed from afflictions, it is true,
   would be the advantage of the outward man; but to be able to bear them
   rejoicingly is an advantage to the soul; a thing capable of greater
   good, than my outward man is capable of.

   Therefore this is the great thing that lies upon us to do; to take
   heed, since we cannot be sure we shall not suffer, that we do not
   suffer as evil doers; neither in respect of the cause, nor of the
   temper of our spirits: to take heed that we suffer not so, as that it
   shall be the effect of a controversy between God and us; or the
   affliction be regarded as his coming upon us with anger and
   displeasure. We are to see to it that we have no rebuke nor anger to
   reflect upon; (these tend to shame, these are humbling things) that we
   may regard his sovereignty and divine pleasure as things in which we
   may rejoice and triumph; which sovereign pleasure we may rejoicingly
   comply with, when once we can make it out, that the affliction of our
   lot is principally of a tentative nature, to try our loyalty to God,
   and fidelity to his interest.

SERMON IV. [78]

   1 Peter v. 10.

   But the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal
   glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered
   awhile, make you perfect, stablish,
   strengthen, settle you.

   I SHALL spend none of your time at all in looking upon the context. And
   although there are many great truths, which lie within the compass of
   this verse, as any of you may easily apprehend at first sight; I shall
   only pitch upon that one which I intend to insist upon, and which it
   may be hoped will be equally suitable to the time and to our case, as
   it is to the text. You may without further preface take it thus;

   That to a right and well-disposed judgment, spiritual improvements and
   advantages by sufferings, are more desirable, than a freedom from those
   sufferings themselves.

   That the ground may be clear, I shall present you with a supposition or
   two, before I proceed to make out the truth itself. As

   First: We will suppose these expressions, to wit, "make yon perfect,
   stablish, strengthen, settle you," do all of them hold forth to us
   spiritual improvement and gain. I apprehend that none of you will
   doubt, but the apostle by these expressions in tended the better state
   of those, to whom he wrote, in spiritual respects. We may suppose not
   of each person considered absolutely, and singly; but all considered in
   common, that they might be brought into a better state with reference
   to their spiritual concernments and affairs; which indeed the word
   kataptisai doth more especially seem to hint to us. It signifies the
   setting in joint, what was unjointed before, and quite out of frame;
   and so rather imports a relation to a community, than to a single
   person alone. But take all together, and no doubt the expressions do
   intend spiritual improvement and advantage. And then again,

   Secondly: We may lay down this further supposition, that the order of
   the sufferings here mentioned is not merely that of precedency in time,
   but of subserviency to some kind of cause that has an instrumental
   influence to their spiritual advantage. "After that ye have suffered
   awhile, or you having suffered a little" (as the words may be read, for
   the word "after" is not in the Greek text) "May the God of all grace
   make you perfect," &c. But it would be very unreasonable to suppose,
   that these sufferings should only precede, and no more; or have only an
   idle priority in respect of time; for that were to suppose, that God,
   as it were, was consenting to it, that they should suffer for nothing,
   or to no purpose. And therefore we must conclude that the apostle
   intended to insinuate, that this precedent state of suffering would
   conduce, and contribute much to their spiritual improvement; which he
   had principally in his eye, on their behalf. These things being
   supposed, I shall endeavour very briefly to evince to you.

   I. That a well-informed judgment will reckon, and does reckon and
   account, as you have heard, namely, that spiritual improvements and
   advantages by sufferings are more desirable, than a freedom from those
   sufferings themselves. And,

   II. Shew you what reason and ground it has so to judge. And this I
   shall do only from the text, and with all possible brevity, that I may
   hasten,

   III. To the use, which I chiefly intend.

   I. That a well-informed judgment doth reckon spiritual improvements by
   sufferings to be more desirable, than a freedom from those sufferings
   themselves. We need no further light than what the text affords us to
   make this point clear, if we will but admit this twofold consideration;

   1. That this great apostle was undoubtedly furnished withwisdom enough
   to understand what was really best for these scattered strangers, to
   whom he writes here. There can be no room for a doubt concerning this.
   And,

   2. That he was prompted by that love, which would certainly engage him
   to pray for that which was best for them, according to his judgment. We
   can, I say, doubt of neither of these, if we will but consider that
   this prayer of his was indited by the Spirit of all wisdom, and love.
   We cannot therefore doubt but that he both understood that to be best
   for them, which really was so; and that he thereupon prayed for that,
   in great kindness of heart to this poor people, which he so under stood
   to be best. No more need be said to evince that a well-informed
   judgment will determine thus, that spiritual improvement by sufferings
   is better, than a freedom from them, and more desirable. I proceed to
   shew

   II. That there is a sufficient reason for such a judgment, which we may
   also see in the text; that is, that it is more desirable to have
   sufferings improved, that to have them presently removed from us. And
   this appears most suitable to that grace by which christians are
   called; and also to that glory unto which they are called.

   Observe the connexion of the request, which the apostle makes on the
   behalf of these scattered Jews; (as we have most reason to suppose them
   Jews converted to Christianity) do but observe, I say, the connexion of
   the request, with the preface to it: "The God of all grace, who hath
   called you to his eternal glory by Jesus Christ, make you perfect," &c.
   It is to be supposed, that the preface in this prayer (as it is usually
   intended in all such prayers) should carry somewhat or other in it,
   agreeable to the matter afterwards prayed for. And so it really is
   here. For the apostle does not pray, that these christians might not
   suffer; but that upon, or by the means of their sufferings, they might
   receive that great and spiritual advantage, of being brought into a
   more perfect and better state, than they were in before; and gain more
   strength, more stability, more fixedness than ever. And to pray thus, I
   say, is,

   1 Most suitable to that grace by which they had been called; or most
   suitable to God, as he is the God of all grace.

   But it may be said, "Is that suitable to the gracious nature of God, to
   let his own peculiar people be abused by a vile, wicked world? to
   expose that sort of persons (who of all others do alone love him, and
   are true to him among men) unto violent and injurious usage from the
   rest of mankind?" Yes certainly; if we consider the matter well, it is
   most suitable. God is, it is true, a Father to that select people; but
   consider where the relation falls, and where it terminates. He is said
   in contradistinction to the fathers of our flesh, to be the Father of
   our spirits. Heb. xii. 9. It is certainly most suitable to the love of
   God to let his own people suffer, if you will allow his love to be
   correspondent to the relation. He is indeed related to them as a
   Father, but to what of them? To their spirits principally, and
   especially to that spiritual product, or new nature, of which he is the
   immediate Author. There the relation terminates, to that he is chiefly
   related as a Father, and there his care and love goes with the
   relation, "Let it be well with their spirits, and it matters not much
   how it goes with them any where else. I am the Father of their spirits;
   I am to take care it may go well with them upon spiritual accounts.
   Therefore if their flesh feel pain, if it suffer want, if it be pinched
   and straitened, if it languish and complain, it agrees very well with
   my relation to their spirits, as a Father to them. Let it then be so,
   let sufferings come upon them, if all this shall prove to the greater
   advantage of their spirits; if they shall thereby come to have so much
   more thriving and prosperous souls; if by this means they grow more
   refined; more freed from terrene dross; be more fitted for my
   fellowship; rendered more capable of doing me duty in their respective
   places; and of tasting, and relishing the pleasure thereof; if this be
   the case, I think I deal with them but as a Father, whose relation is
   to their spirits."

   The apostle speaks of this with a great deal of complacency, and as one
   that is highly well pleased. "Though (says he) our outward man perish,
   yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction,
   which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and
   eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are
   seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are
   seen, are temporal; but the things which are not seen, are eternal." 2
   Cor. iv. 16, 17, 18. He does not speak this with any kind of regret
   that he found the outward man so struck as to be continually liable to
   perish.

   "No," saith he, "let it perish daily; I matter it not. Though it does
   perish, that signifies nothing to me, so that the inward man be but
   renewed day by day." And,

   2. It is more suitable to that state of glory, whereunto we are called;
   as well as to that grace, by which we are called. It is very necessary,
   to our being introduced into that glorious, blessed state, that we be
   prepared, and made some way fit for it, before we reach it. And the
   great concernment and necessity of this makes the apostle Paul bless
   God, with a great deal of triumph, on the behalf of those Christian
   Colossians to whom he wrote; and he puts them upon blessing of God,
   that though they were suffering to that degree as that they stood in
   need of all patience, yet that all this while he was making them meet
   to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. Col. i. 11,
   12. He speaks of it as the proper matter of thanksgiving, that though
   they suffered so much as to require their being strengthened with all
   might, according to the glorious power of God; yet it was all well
   enough: they were so far from having cause to complain, that they had a
   great deal of reason rather to give thanks to God. As if he had said,
   "It is a pure, a bright, and lightsome region that you are going to,
   and you need a great deal of refining before you come there, that you
   may be fit to be received. You need to have your spirits clarified, and
   freed from all impure dross, even while you are suffering so as that
   all patience is requisite unto it. You have therefore reason to give
   thanks, if God by this means is making you meet to partake of the
   inheritance of the saints, in their state of life, purity and
   perfection."

   This is also intimated in that place before mentioned. "I do not care,"
   as if he had said, "though the outward man perisheth, while the inward
   is renewed day by day." And how is it renewed? Why thus, the "light
   affliction, which is but for a moment, works out for us a far more
   exceeding and eternal weight of glory." But how do afflictions work out
   a state of glory for us? In answer to this, we are to consider what
   notion we ought to have of the glory, whereof the saints are to be
   partakers here after; and by which they are to be made happy and
   blessed. Now it is not merely an objective glory that can make me
   happy, and be the satisfaction of my soul; that is, to have only some
   glorious sights to behold and look upon, and no more. For I can be
   happy by nothing, which is not united to me; and it is impossible any
   one should be blessed by a distant good, severed from themselves. And
   therefore we are told how we are to conceive of this glory, by St.
   Paul, who tells us it is a glory that is to be revealed in us. Rom.
   viii. 18. It is a glory most intimate to the subjects, and by which
   they are made glorious; not merely to be seen, but what they themselves
   are to bear: and therefore the apostle says it is eis emas, to be
   revealed in, or into us. It is that impress of the divine glory, which
   is imparted and communicated from God to the soul, upon the vision of
   his blessed face; by which it is transformed perfectly now in to the
   same likeness, as much as a creature can be like to him. Here is the
   glory, by which souls are made happy and blessed at last; and into the
   stated participation of which they are now actually called by Jesus
   Christ.

   Now consider this glory so, as here explained, and it is very
   apprehensible how the light afflictions, that are but for a moment, do
   work it out for us. For they gradually refine the soul after the image
   of the divine nature, make it more and more conformed to God; and
   according to the degree of the progress to which this refining work is
   carried on by such means while we are in this world, is our
   participation of the divine glory hereafter. According to the capacity
   of the vessel, which God hath designed to be a vessel of glory and
   honour, is the measure of that glory which is to be put into it in the
   other state. But certainly by this refinement, to which afflictions are
   so subservient and useful in this world, the soul is made more and more
   capable and receptive; it is refined, and enlarged at once. And thus it
   is more suitable to that state of glory to which we are called, which
   was to be proved, in order to shew that it is more desirable to have
   sufferings improved, than to be freed from those sufferings themselves.

   III. Therefore now to apply this, as the time will allow; and,

   1. For Instruction.

   (1.) We may learn hence, that we have another interest to Concern
   ourselves about, besides that of our flesh or outward man. For
   otherwise it could never be understood how that, which is really an
   offence and prejudice to the outward man, should be an advantage to us
   in any other respect. As chastising afflictions by a paternal rod are
   natural evils, but yet inflicted on us for spiritual good. It is plain
   then, I say, we have another interest about which we ought to be
   concerned.

   (2.) We may further collect; that these two interests, as they are very
   distinct, so they are ordinarily too, very opposite to one another.
   That may make for the advantage of the spirit or inward man, which is
   greatly to the hurt and prejudice of of the outward; and that which
   contributes to the gratification and pleasure of the outward man, may
   be very prejudicial to the inward. These are opposite interests, and we
   should consider them as such; and it would be of very great advantage
   to us, through our whole course, to carry this as a fixed thought with
   us, "That the interests of my flesh, and of my spirit, are of ten
   stated in such an actual opposition to one another, that what makes for
   the advantage of the one, is frequently hurtful and prejudicial to the
   other." For if we would but allow ourselves to consider this, and admit
   it as a fixed thought, then it would not, upon every occasion that
   occurs to us, be our first concern and care; namely, "What shall I do
   to save my flesh and outward man? how shall I order matters that all
   may go well with that?" especially as there is another interest in
   myself, which may be provided for by the methods of providence, that
   cast a severe and threatening aspect upon the other. And,

   (3.) We may hence further learn, that the interest of the inward man is
   much more considerable than that of the flesh; which is the subject of
   the supposed sufferings, of which the apostle speaks, who puts up a
   very solemn request for spiritual advantage by such sufferings. He that
   loved them so well does not pray, that they might not suffer at all;
   but only that after they had suffered a little, they might be perfected
   and established. Certainly our spiritual interest is more considerable,
   than our outward interest; and we should be willing that the interest
   and advantage of the flesh, should be sacrificed to the interest of the
   soul: and that which I am willing to part with for another, must
   certainly be less considerable than the other. Bur,

   (4.) We may also learn, that sufferings are not novelties among the
   people of God in this world; neither are they to be looked upon as
   novel, even the sharpest and severest of them. The apostle directs
   those, to whom he writes, in the same chapter, that they should look
   with another kind of eye upon an afflicted state, than to suppose it a
   new thing, or as if nothing like it was known before. In the verse
   before my text, he intimates that they only suffered such afflictions
   as were common to others in the world, and such as many good men had
   endured, who were gone before them. And in another place of this
   epistle he admonishes them not to think strange even of the fiery trial
   ("which," says he, "is to try you") as if some strange thing had
   happened to them; assuring them: that after they had suffered awhile,
   the Spirit of glory and of God should rest upon them. That they should
   surfer was reckoned upon, taken for granted; and therefore it speaks a
   very strange spirit among us, if the thoughts of any sufferings should
   presently startle us. What! are we grown so soft and delicate, that we
   must meet with no afflictions in the world? as if it were a more
   wonderful thing that we should suffer, than others who have gone before
   us in former days. Wherein are we better than they?

   2. I pass on to another use, which may be for conviction to us, who
   seem to be so much of another judgment from the apostle, in this
   important case. And there are two or three things which I would here
   premise. As

   (1.) That there is no present question depending whether we should
   simply desire to be freed from affliction, yea or no; or whether,
   considering the matter simply in itself, we may not judge it desirable
   to be free from affliction. This is not the thing concerned in the
   present discourse, nor any part of it. It will be easily acknowledged,
   that the sufferings we speak of are natural evils; and evil as such, or
   in itself, cannot be eligible to a reasonable nature. But the thing we
   speak of is, that when these two matters are compared; to wit, freedom
   from afflictions, and spiritual advantage by them, we should not prefer
   the former: not but that a freedom from suffering, simply in itself and
   alone, is a desirable thing; but compared with the spiritual advantages
   arising from thence, is not to be preferred or desired by us. And,

   (2.) I again premise, that by judgment here I do not intend a mere
   notional, but a practical judgment. For I make no question but we are
   all of the apostle's mind without any more ado; and agree with him that
   it is better to have spiritual advantage by affliction, than to be free
   from it. But when we speak of a practical judgment, here it is that our
   error lies, and wherein we are to be rectified. The practical judgment
   is that, to which the temper of a man's soul doth correspond: that
   which is of such power and prevalency with a man, as to impress its own
   likeness, or somewhat correspondent to itself upon his own heart, upon
   his will, his choice, and affections; and so consequently influence the
   course of his walking, and conversation. The thing therefore I complain
   of, in this case, is, that the temper of our spirits is so unsuitable;
   so unlike the apostle's judgment in this case, that spiritual
   improvement by suffering is more desirable than freedom from it. These
   things being premised, I shall evince, that there is a failure among us
   in these things, particularly that we are not likeminded with the
   apostle in this matter, and then, shew you the great evil of it, that
   is, of our error in this regard.

   [1.] I am to evince that there is a great failure or mistake in our
   judgment, if we are not of the same mind with the apostle as to this
   point. And this I would do by putting a few queries to you, by which
   you may be able to convict yourselves where in the matter does require,
   and will admit. As

   First. Whether are we move sensible of the external calamities which
   befall us, than of inward spiritual distempers? Suppose a person by
   some surprising providence lose all he had in the world, is reduced to
   the utmost distress and necessity, whether is not this more grievous,
   or more sensibly felt than inward spiritual evils? "Do I so cry and
   bemoan myself because of the body of sin and death, as I do when I have
   lost my friend, my husband, my wife, my child, my house, my estate, my
   pleasant delectable things in this world?" In such cases we cry out as
   undone persons; we mourn and refuse to be comforted. "But I have an
   earthly, vain heart; a heart that will not be brought to live in love,
   and communion with God; unapt to prayer, to meditation, to spiritual
   commerce with heaven." Do we so sensibly complain upon these accounts,
   I say, as men are apt to do under the sharp and acute sense of external
   evils? This shews which way the poize of our spirits inclines, and we
   may plainly discern it by urging ourselves with this question.

   Secondly. Whether do we more dread and fear the continuance, and
   increase of inward distempers, or external sufferings? which, I say, is
   more the matter of our dread? I have a near evil that hath pressed me,
   and is like to do so still; a carnal, stupid, terrene, and corrupt
   heart; whether do I dread the continuance of this, or the increase of
   it; more than I do the continuance, or increase of any external
   sufferings that are upon me, or may threaten me? If you should be told,
   that there is danger of being devoured in all your external concerns by
   a formidable enemy; or that you are in danger of fire, of great losses,
   of coming into a decayed state in respect of your Trade and traffic;
   which things would you think of with the most dread? Should not we
   dread more the thoughts of being turned out of all, driven from house
   and home, of going to seek our bread in desolate places, of wandering
   in wildernesses and deserts, lurking in dens and holes of the earth?
   Should we not, I say, think of these things with more dread, than we
   ordinarily do of that close, latent enemy, that lies lurking at our
   very hearts and souls? namely, infidelity within, and disaffection to
   God? a proneness to depart from him, and a heart bent to backslide?
   Which sort of evils are we most apt to dread?

   Thirdly. Which should we consider with more complacency, an external
   state of things just agreeable to such an idea as we could form to
   ourselves in our own minds; or an inward frame of holiness, agreeable
   to the idea which the blessed God hath set before us in the word of
   truth? which, I say, should we think of with more delight? Suppose we
   should have the prospect set before us of such a state of things in
   outward respects as we could wish; garners yielding all kind of store,
   nothing but prosperity, pleasure and peace in our dwellings; all the
   liberty our hearts could desire, to do and walk according to our own
   inclinations: and frame again the prospect of an enlightened, lively
   mind and spirit; full of God, full of heaven, full of divine love, full
   of spiritual strength, vigour, activity and fervour in all holy
   exercises whatsoever; and which, I pray, of these seemeth the more
   grateful prospect to us? Or which is the more taking thing with our
   hearts, upon the view of the one and the other? to have in outward
   respects, all the opulence and prosperity our hearts could wish on the
   one hand; and on the other, to have hearts disentangled and freed from
   sin, so as that we may go to God upon all occasions with freedom, or
   without restraint, and always converse with him with delight?

   Such questions as these closely urged may convince some, as the case
   may require, how much they differ from this apostle; and are of a
   different sense and estimate from him, in reference to what we are
   speaking of. And if there be such a disagreeing judgment in this case,
   then we are to consider,

   [2.] The great evil of it. And this I might represent to you very
   largely; but, at present, take some account of it only in these few
   particulars.

   First. It speaks great injudiciousness in the matter of discerning
   between things that differ, and which doth more excel. It is one great
   part of the work and business of judgment to distinguish between
   things, that are of different value from one another; and he is a very
   injudicious man, who is not able to prefer those things that are more
   excellent, which when compared and judged of do vastly differ: as it
   would argue very great injudiciousness indeed if I could not tell which
   of the two to prefer; a gay feather, or a rich diamond. The odds is so
   vastly great here, that it must needs argue a great want of discerning
   the just value of things: and so it must in like manner if we cannot
   tell which is to be rather chosen; a little freedom from pain and
   affliction, or that which is a great advantage and gain to the inward
   man.

   Secondly. It argues very great unbelief of the truth of God's word in
   reference to this very case. It is expressly said, AH things shall work
   together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the called
   according to his purpose. Rom. viii. 28. But we do not believe this;
   for it is plain that if we did believe it, it were then altogether
   impossible we should reject or less value that, which at the same time
   we believe to be the greater good. For it is spiritual good that is
   there meant, which is to be wrought out by external natural evils. And
   can we tolerate in ourselves an habitual indisposition to take God's
   word? Sure, methinks, we should look upon this as a most intolerable
   thing.

   Thirdly. It argues a very low and mean temper of spirit, when we do not
   know how to value and favour most our best and most excellent good. It
   shews that we have a very vile esteem of our own souls, when we are
   more concerned about a clod of clay, a lump of flesh, than we are about
   them, or their benefit and advantage. And

   Fourthly. It argues most unworthy thoughts of the wisdom and goodness
   of the providence of God, with respect to those sufferings and
   afflictions we speak of. It looks as if we did not really believe, that
   they are brought upon us for some greater good, than any we can lose,
   or be indamaged in, by them; or that we thought that neither wisdom, or
   goodness, conducted the course of affairs towards us. What account can
   we give, or what reasons produce, why the course of divine providence
   should run so and so (as it many times has done in the world) as to
   cast smiling fair aspects on the worst sort of men, and frowning severe
   aspects on the better sort? Hence men have been apt to make very
   sinister interpretations, and applications. Thus the prophet Malachi
   charges some in his time: "Ye have wearied the Lord with your words:
   yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? when ye say, every one that
   doeth evil, is good in the sight of the Lord, and he delighteth in
   them; or, where is the God of judgment?" Mal. ii. 17. And truly, though
   we have explicit formed thoughts otherwise, yet the sense of our hearts
   will seem to be agreeable to such thoughts as these, if we tolerate in
   ourselves the error which I am detecting, and representing the evil of;
   that is, of supposing that it were better to be freed from afflictions,
   than to have them improved to our gain and advantage. Either we must
   think, that afflictions come upon the people of God by chance, and so
   that God has no design at all by such an ordering of things; or else,
   that he afflicts his people out of hatred and perfect ill-will: both
   which are monstrous, and horrid thoughts. It were altogether an
   unaccountable thing, upon the whole matter, why the course of the
   dispensations of God's providence should be as it ordinarily is, that
   the saints should be exposed to sufferings and afflictions, while the
   wicked live in ease, prosperity and pleasure; I say, this were
   unaccountable, if it could not be said that there is some greater good
   to be wrought out by these sufferings which shall abundantly compensate
   and countervail them. But if we persist in the error I speak of, we
   lose the only way of solving this difficulty of providence.

   Fifthly. To represent the evil of this error yet more, I would observe,
   that it argues much impatience and weakness of spirit: for patience is
   passive power, fortitude, or ability to suffer. It argues very great
   weakness when we had a great deal rather not he good, than suffer
   affliction. Sure it is a sign that we can suffer nothing. And if there
   he such a disposition to faint in the day of adversity, our strength is
   small; as saith the wise man: and this is not only our great infelicity
   but our sin. Prov. xxiv. 10.

   Sixthly. It is a tacit choosing of sin, rather than affliction; and
   certainly that is a very had thing. It is manifestly so, if we consider
   and look upon the case as it is. "Let me be impure still, drossy and
   terrene still, unlike to God still; so my flesh may but escape, my
   sense be gratified and indulged, and incur no prejudice."

   Seventhly. It argues a great deal of pride; and also insensibleness
   both of what we deserve, and what we need. If any can by no means bring
   their spirits to think of suffering, there commonly lies at the bottom
   an insensibility of what they are; what wretched hearts, and untoward
   natures they have. It is little apprehended what we deserve, and what
   we need, when we look upon such an aspect of providence as unsuitable;
   which threatens us with suffering, and is like to prove afflictive.
   This should be the sense of our hearts: "Alas! whatever I suffer, it is
   much less than my iniquity deserves! Yea, if I suffer never so
   severely, it is but what the exigency of my case requires. My heart is
   very sleepy and dead, and needeth rousing; it is very drossy and needs
   a hot furnace." And we should think so if we thought of ourselves
   aright, and if too good an opinion of ourselves did not blind our eyes.
   I might mention several things more, but the time permits not. I shall
   only design, hereupon in the close, to recommend two things;

   i. That we should fix this judgment of the apostle in ourselves, as the
   standard and measure of our own. I judge thus, as the apostle Paul
   says; "I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy
   to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us." Rom. viii.
   18. As if he had said, "This is my logic, I compute so upon the whole
   matter; and this is the result I come to, having considered it
   thoroughly, and viewed it on every side." Let us settle our judgment of
   this in like manner, and record it: "This was my mind at such a time,
   and I came then to be convinced of the truth of it. I will never alter
   it, till I see better reason (which I suppose I never shall) for laying
   it down, than I had to take it up." And,

   ii. Agreeably hereunto let us direct the scope, current, and end of our
   prayers, on such days as these, as the apostle here doth his. It is
   necessary our hearts should be brought to an agreement with our
   judgments. What is the good I should most desire, and wish, and seek
   for my soul this day? If this be a right judgment which we have now
   heard of, it will be very good for us, at such times as these, and even
   at all times in our prayers to say: "I pray not that I may be freed
   from suffering; that is not the great thing I request. As to that I
   refer myself to the divine pleasure, and acquiesce in the determination
   of providence. But, O Lord! I have another request to make unto thee,
   that whatsoever shall befall me, I may have more of thine image; more
   life and strength; vigour and heavenliness; fitted for holiness in this
   world, and blessedness in the other. And then let my sufferings be what
   they will, so they be but subservient to this great design, of
   procuring my spiritual advantage."

   And we pray upon pretty sure grounds when we pray thus. We do not need
   to doubt whether this be agreeable to the divine will or no. We are
   upon a certainty. If I should insist peremptorily in prayer upon this,
   and that temporal good for myself, or the community I belong unto, it
   may be said; "Where is the promise? and thereupon, where is the faith
   of being heard in such a prayer?" But I am sure I pray agreeably to his
   own will, when I pray, that I may be brought into spiritual prosperity.
   I am sure therein to suit with what he himself doth command. This will
   be acceptable, and well-pleasing to God; and turn to my ineffable good
   and advantage, both here and hereafter.

SERMON V. [79]

   Isaiah lxiii. 10.

   But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore
   he was turned to be their enemy, and he
   fought against them.

   IN the forgoing part of this chapter you have a representation, as it
   is generally agreed, of our Lord Christ in triumph; returning as a
   conqueror from his victories, with garments discoloured with the blood
   of the slain. "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments
   from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
   greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to
   save," The enemies, whom the Messiah is supposed to have engaged
   against, are represented and set forth by Edom, and the metropolis
   thereof, Bozrah; because they were the next enemies to the church of
   God, mostly confined within Palestine, upon which Idumea bordered, and
   who were continually vexatious, and afflictive to them: by these, I
   say, are the spiritual enemies represented, which our Lord Jesus Christ
   was to set himself against. And so I have taken notice of a certain
   author (though I profess not to like all his allegories) who
   allegorically speaks of the carnal part, under the name of Edom. "The
   mind or spirit ought to follow God unweariedly, without deviating or
   turning aside, lest he come into Edom:" alluding no doubt to the word
   itself edom or earth, as the name of Adam comes from the same root.
   Against these spiritual enemies, that readily fall in with our carnal,
   earthly part, did our Lord Jesus Christ use his prowess, unto a
   glorious victory and triumph. This being represented, how ready the
   Redeemer was to undertake on the behalf of them, who were to be
   defended, and saved by him; a reflection is made upon God's former
   dealings on the behalf of this people, and their unequal carriage and
   deportment towards him, in the seventh, eighth, and ninth verses. But I
   cannot go distinctly over them. Unto which this complaint is subjoined;
   "But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit; therefore he was turned
   to be their enemy, and he fought against them."

   There are two things, which present themselves to our view, and
   consideration, from these words: namely, that the rebellions of a
   people professing the name of God, are very vexatious to his Spirit;
   and that such vexations engage him against them as their enemy. To
   speak to both these together, for the sake of dispatch, I shall do only
   these two things.

   I. Inquire concerning the evil done; that is, vexing the Spirit of God,
   by rebelling against him. And,

   II. Concerning the evil suffered; and that is his turning against them,
   so as to become their enemy. Upon which,

   III. The use of all will ensue.

   I. As to the evil done, we are to inquire in the first place concerning
   the nature of it; and then in the next place, the cause thereof.

   1. Let us consider the nature of the evil done, namely, the vexing of
   the Spirit of God. We are not to understand it as if the blessed Spirit
   of God was capable of such vexation, as we are in ourselves; that is,
   of real perturbation or passion. That, common reason will tell us, the
   divine nature is not capable of. But yet notwithstanding, this doth not
   signify nothing; there is some great thing lies under this expression,
   which we may conceive of in these two particulars.

   (1.) His will is really crossed; somewhat is done, that is, against his
   will. I mean his will concerning our duty, not his will concerning the
   event; against his preceptive will and consequently against that good,
   which he wills to us upon the supposition of our compliance with his
   just and righteous will. He really wills many things in reference to
   men, which he doth not will effectually to procure that they shall be
   done. He wills our obedience and duty; and, as this is connected with
   it, he wills also our felicity and happiness. The will of God in the
   former part, is expressed by his precepts; in the latter, by his
   promises, so far as they are of a general tenor. But there is a will of
   his in reference to the event, of which it may be truly said, "Who hath
   resisted his will?" Rom. ix. 19. When the commands of God are
   disobeyed, and persons by their disobedience rush upon vengeance, and
   put themselves under the effects of divine displeasure; then is that
   done, which is averse to the legislative will of God, as it is
   signified to us by his word. And this is implied in the expression in
   the text of his being vexed; namely, that there is a matter or object
   lying before him, at which he may take offence, or resent.

   (2.) It is implied also, that he doth apprehend and resent this matter;
   though without any commotion, or perturbation. He resents it so as not
   to look upon it as a matter of indifference. It does not escape his
   notice, as profane, atheistical spirits are apt to fancy; who say, "The
   Lord shall not see, neither will the God of Jacob regard it." Psal.
   xciv. 7 No, there is no such thing to be imagined. God takes notice of
   the matter, and resents the wrong done to him; yet so calm is the
   resentment, as every way agrees with the felicity of the divine nature.
   It is this which he lays up in store, as it is emphatically expressed
   by Moses, and seals up among his treasures. Deut. xxxii. 34. This he
   keeps by him as the just matter of a controversy, which he will manage;
   and will animadvert upon it in his own time, and when a fit and proper
   season shall come. So much then are we to conceive as spoken of God, or
   of the Spirit of God, under the expression of its being vexed.

   2. We are now to inquire concerning the cause of this vexation; or
   shew, what it is that thus vexes the Spirit of God. We may well
   understand in the general that sin does so; being in its own nature a
   direct contrariety to his good, and holy, and acceptable will. But
   especially rebellion against the Spirit of God is vexatious, which is a
   higher pitch of sin; and implies a continued course of disobedience.
   Rebellion speaks a prevalent, and continued malignity of sin. "They
   rebelled, and vexed his Spirit."

   But to be more particular here; we may understand what sin is more
   especially vexing to the Spirit of God, if we allow ourselves to
   consider what the titles and attributes of this Spirit in Scripture
   are. By these we shall know what is the tendency of the office and
   operations of the blessed Spirit of God; and so more easily conceive
   what tends to vex, and to grieve it, as you know the expression is
   elsewhere. "Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed
   unto the day of redemption." Ephes. iv. 30.

   (1.) The Spirit of God is styled the Spirit of truth. John xiv. 17. It
   is therefore very grievous, and vexing to this Spirit, to have a light
   esteem of divine truth; to be indifferently affected towards it; to
   have a loose adherence to it; an easiness to part with it; and much
   more a proneness to oppose it, and run away from it. This, I say, must
   needs be vexing to the Spirit of God. And because I foresee I shall be
   able to speak but little to the use, I desire you as we go along to
   make reflections on each head; and to consider how far you may suppose
   yourselves guilty, and how far this age (professing the truth of God)
   is guilty of vexing the Spirit in this, and other respects. Again,

   (2.) It is mentioned in Scripture under the name of the Spirit of
   grace. Heb. x. 29. It is therefore very vexing to this blessed Spirit
   when that grace, of which it is the author, and which it is its office
   and business to convey and apply, or effectually to reveal, is
   rejected; when in that gospel under which we live, and which is the
   ministration of the Spirit, grace is offered and despised; when there
   are few that express any regard to, or any desire or value of the
   Spirit of God: this is a most vexing thing to this Spirit.

   (3.) It is called the Spirit of faith. 2 Cor. iv. 13. Infidelity
   therefore must needs be reckoned a most vexing thing to this Spirit.
   When persons continue under the gospel in obstinate unbelief; and the
   great things, there revealed and discovered to us, are but as a tale
   that is told; or regarded no more than we would regard the word of a
   child; a most vexing thing to the Spirit of God this must be understood
   to be. More over,

   (4.) It is a Spirit of contrition and repentance. This is an effect
   that is attributed to this Spirit as the author of it. The Spirit of
   grace and supplication shall be poured forth, as it is promised in
   Zechariah, and then it is that souls shall mourn over him whom they
   have pierced, and be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness
   for his first-born. Zech. xii. 10. An impenitent hard heart, a heart
   that cannot repent, is a most vexatious thing to the Spirit of God. We
   cannot conceive a greater vexation to him, than to find hearts hard as
   rocks and stones, under the dispensation of the everlasting gospel.

   (5.) It is stiled the Spirit of love; which is the great principle,
   that disposes and inclines the soul towards God. He hath given us the
   Spirit of love, (2 Tim. i. 7.) that principle which influenceth, and is
   the life and soul of all the communion there is, between the blessed
   God, and those that do be long to him; which itself therefore is called
   "the communion of the Holy Ghost." 2 Cor. xiii. 14. A cold heart then
   towards God, a heart that is disaffected to him, that keeps at a
   distance from him, that will not be engaged in sweet communion with him
   through love, is a most vexing thing to his Spirit. Again it is in the

   (6.) Place, called a Spirit of power and of life. It is the Spirit that
   quickeneth, says our Lord. John vi. 63. And again St. Paul tells us,
   God hath given to us the Spirit of power. 2 Tim. i. 7. It is a very
   vexatious thing to this Spirit, when any indulge themselves in deadness
   of heart; when they allow themselves to be formal, lukewarm, and
   indifferent; neither cold nor hot, as it was said of the Laodicean
   church, whom, our Lord threatens therefore to spue out of his mouth; a
   strong expression of his being vexed, and of his resenting the matter
   with very high displeasure. Rev. iii. 15, 16.

   (7.) It is stiled the Spirit of holiness. Rom. i. 4. And here in our
   text it is said, They rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit. This is a
   most vexing thing, when persons professing the Christian name indulge
   themselves in a liberty to walk at random; are impatient of restraints;
   affect libertinism; have not refrained their feet but have loved to
   wander: therefore the Lord doth not accept them; he will now remember
   their iniquity, and visit their sins. Jer. xiv. 10. When no bonds can
   be endured; when the yoke and burden of our Lord Jesus Christ are
   apprehended uneasy, grievous, and intolerable; and the resolution is
   come to this, "Let us cast away his cords, let us throw off his bonds
   from us, he shall not reign over us;" when the law of sin and death
   contesteth to that height against the law of the Spirit of life in
   Christ Jesus, as to engage us to comply with the lustings of the flesh;
   this is a most vexatious thing to the Spirit of our purity and
   holiness.

   (8.) It is a heavenly Spirit; and the design of all its gracious
   operations upon souls is to fit them for heaven. "He that hath wrought
   us for the selfsame thing, is God, who also hath given unto us the
   earnest of the Spirit." 2 Cor. v. 5. And again says the apostle, "We
   have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of
   God, that we might know the things which are freely given us of God:"
   even those things which "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
   entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
   them that love him." 1 Cor. ii. 12, 9. A worldly heart therefore is a
   vexation to this Spirit; that is, when we mingle with, and suffer
   ourselves to be swallowed up of the spirit of this world: the
   inclinations and tendencies of which spirit are earthly, and running
   downwards; while the Spirit of God is aiming to lift us up towards God
   and heaven. Again,

   (9.) It is a Spirit of prayer. So it is called in Scripture, the Spirit
   of supplication. Zech. xii. 10 It is the great business of this Spirit
   to act souls, and to raise them to God, in the way of prayer. It is a
   very great vexation therefore to the holy Spirit, when persons grow to
   a prayerless disposition; do not care to converse with God in this
   duty; are slow in the business of prayer; either not minding it, or
   doing it as though they did it not: this, I say, is a very vexing
   thing. So he interprets it, and speaks of it with resentment: "Thou
   hast not called upon me, O Jacob; thou art weary of me, O Israel."
   Isai. xliii. 22. When persons, who formerly loved prayer, are now grown
   out of love with it; when those, that have taken pleasure in being in
   their closets, and shut up in corners, are now grown strange to him,
   and care not to come nigh him in that way; this is especially to
   provoke and grieve the Spirit. The very bent and tendency of such a
   soul runs now directly counter to his proper design and business; which
   is to engage the souls of men with God in that great duty, wherein they
   may enjoy continually a fruitful and useful commerce with him. But they
   decline, and will not be brought to it by this means. This is also a
   very bitter vexation. And again,

   (10.) It is a Spirit of sincerity and uprightness; and wherever it
   obtains, it makes men upright and sincere. Thus it is called the Spirit
   of a sound mind. 2 Tim. i. 7 Hypocrisy therefore, or a deceitful
   dealing with the blessed God in matters of religion, is a most
   vexatious thing to his Spirit. When there is only a shew and appearance
   of love, and devotedness to him; and this only made a cover to a false
   disloyal heart: this is an abomination unto God. He loves truth in the
   inward parts, and his countenance beholdeth the upright; giving them
   pleasant, smiling, complacential looks, which are plain indications of
   his approving, and being well pleased with them. So again, he cannot
   but frown with displeasure, where there is falsehood and deceit; where
   there is an unsound heart; a latent hypocrisy, as if we designed to
   impose upon him by a cheat and shew; to deceive and mock him, who
   cannot be deceived, neither will be mocked.

   (11.) It is a Spirit of union, peace, and meekness, among them that
   belong to God. It is designed to form the hearts of believers to these
   things; and so far as his Spirit is given, one heart and one way are
   also given; as we may see from Ezekiel xi. 19. compared with other
   scriptures. Animosities among the people of God; heart-burnings,
   whether they be upon a common, or a particular, personal account; are
   the most vexing things imaginable to the Spirit of God, which is the
   Spirit of union, peace, and concord, and the very soul of the mystical
   body. It is a very vexatious thing when one member of this body goes to
   fight with another; and it may be some against the common interest of
   the whole. And it is in the

   Last place, A Spirit of sobriety and temperance, in opposition to
   grossly sensual lusts. It is a very vexatious thing to the Spirit of
   God, when among a people that profess his name, there is a general
   profusion, and running into vile sensual lusts. Some are sensual, not
   having the Spirit. Jude 19. The connection is very observable. Whereas
   God gives his Spirit, to form a people to that purity, that they may be
   different from the rest of the world; they allow themselves to run into
   the same excess of riot. And I believe there are few of us that ever
   heard, or read of an age, in which there were more gross instances of
   impurity among professors, than the present. How many instances do we
   hear of this kind! It must needs be very vexatious to the holy Spirit,
   whose design it is to form a people unto God, to bear up his name in
   opposition to a commonly dissolute, and debauched age.

   You see then as to the evil done, what it is, and what is the cause of
   it; namely, sin, and more especially rebellion in those instances,
   wherein the designs of the Spirit (as represented to us by various
   titles and attributes in Scripture) are most opposed. We are therefore
   now,

   II. To inquire concerning the evil suffered hereupon; or which we may
   expect will be inflicted on persons on this account: namely, his
   turning against them so as to become their enemy. Here we should speak
   distinctly,

   1. Concerning the nature of this evil; and,

   2. Concerning the issue of it, and how justly it does ensue in this
   case.

   1. Let us consider the nature of this evil, and shew what is imported
   in it. And here something is expressed, and something is implied in the
   words of my text; "therefore he turned to be their enemy, and he fought
   against them." It is implied, that he shall cease doing for such a
   people as he hath done. If he was wont formerly to be a bountiful,
   liberal benefactor, he shall stop his hand. And especially it is to be
   expected, that we should be so dealt with in that very respect, wherein
   we have been vexatious: that is, Have we vexed the Spirit of God? then
   it is natural to expect that the Spirit of God will retire. This is
   certainly implied in his becoming an enemy to us. If he become an
   enemy, it is not likely he should hold that friendly commerce, which
   sometimes he hath done. If God become our enemy, his Spirit shall
   withdraw from us; shall not strive, nor wrestle with us. And then also
   these words express some positive evils against such persons; which t
   might instance in many particulars, but cannot now mention them.

   2. I am to consider how justly this penal evil does ensue in this case;
   namely, that God should turn against those, who rebel and vex his
   Spirit. This is to be collected from the greatness of the evil done.
   Consider therefore how just cause and matter of provocation, this
   injurious dealing with the Spirit of God doth carry in it.
   Particularly,

   (1.) Consider that this is very despiteful dealing, to do that which
   will vex his very Spirit. Sinners of this kind are expressly said to do
   "despite unto the Spirit of grace." Heb. x. 29 And surely to do that,
   which must directly contradict the very business and design of the
   Spirit, is a most spiteful kind of wickedness.

   (2.) Consider that this is a wickedness, wherein the most immediate
   kind of affront is offered unto God. He deals with men in a more
   distant way when he deals with them in his providence, or the outward
   manifestation of his will in his word. But when he comes to deal with
   the spirits of men, and to have his work within them, and their spirits
   resist and oppose him; there is then a most immediate contest between
   the blessed God and them. And we cannot but think this is a high
   provocation unto God, and reckon upon this issue, that he must hereupon
   become our enemy. And,

   (3.) It is to be considered that sinning so as more directly to vex the
   Spirit of God, does carry with it a withstanding of the Spirit in that
   which is its proper office; which is a great aggravation of the
   wickedness. It is one thing when I withstand a person in a thing, which
   he does casually and by the by; and another when I withstand him in
   that, which is his stated business. It is, you know, reckoned a high
   affront among men to be resisted, and withstood in an office. To oppose
   an ordinary, private person, is but a small matter in comparison of
   affronting an officer, in the execution of his office. The Spirit of
   God, when it is about the work of diffusing gospel light and grace, is
   in the work of its own office. And when persons do such things as are
   vexatious in this respect; that is, oppose and withstand the holy
   Spirit in its proper stated business, this must needs be highly
   provoking. It is a bold and insolent affront done to the blessed God;
   and therefore may well infer upon such a people that dreadful thing
   that God should turn against them, and become their enemy.

   III. Now as to the use (though these matters have been more lightly
   touched and considered, than the matter required for want of time) we
   may infer the following things.

   1 We may infer hence, that among a people professing the name of God,
   the Spirit of God is wont to be at work; and where it is not doing any
   work, we cannot suppose it to be thus vexatiously resisted, and
   contended against. It was the testimony that Stephen bore against this
   people, even dying, that they constantly rebelled, and vexed the Holy
   Spirit. "Ye do all ways resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did so
   do ye." Acts vii. 51. Now what doth this imply? Inasmuch as it is said
   expressly that there was a war kept up against the Spirit of God, from
   age to age, and from generation to generation; it implies, that as they
   were from age to age a professing people, so from age to age the Spirit
   of God was still, more or less, striving with them: or else how could
   they be said always to resist? Where there is no striving, there is no
   resisting. We ought therefore to consider this, that ordinarily where
   the gospel is professed; there the Spirit of God is at work, more or
   less; though not always so, as to prevail. It is a free Spirit; and
   works, as the wind blows, where it listeth, and to what degree also.
   But I conceive, that in all those who live under the gospel, the Spirit
   of God moves at some times, in one degree or another. For it is hardly
   to be imagined, that any should wear out a life's time under the
   gospel, and not, one time or other, have the injection of some good
   thought, some check or rebuke, as to their evil course; and some
   inclination, at least, to return, and alter their course. And I doubt
   not but there is a parity between these two cases; that is, as in
   matters of consolation the Spirit of God co-operates with our spirits,
   so he doth in matters of conviction, whether it ever becomes effectual
   or no. So that I reckon it most safe, and most honourable to God, when
   any injection of that kind is made in the conscience of any man, that
   lives under the gospel, to ascribe it to the Spirit in its common
   operations.

   2. We are hereupon to reflect and consider, whether this may not be
   much our case and the case of the generality at this time, even thus
   like the Jews to have vexed the holy Spirit of God, which hath been for
   a long season dealing with us. Recount with yourselves the particulars
   mentioned; and think whether there has not been a great deal of
   vexation given the Spirit of God in those several ways. But I cannot
   stand now to remind you of them.

   3. Let us be hereupon persuaded to hasten the taking up this
   controversy (for it is a dreadful thing to have it depending) by
   humbling, and abasing ourselves in the dust, before the Lord; for
   ourselves on our own account, and on the behalf of the generality of
   those among whom we dwell. Surely this ought to be much the business of
   such a day as this, even deeply to humble ourselves before the Lord,
   for the vexation given to his Spirit; and that our temper, course, and
   spirits run sp directly counter to him. We should not want matter of
   humiliation for many such days, if we did but seriously consider this
   case; though every day should be kept a fast, and as a day of
   humiliation on this account. And indeed it is sad, when the matter of
   humiliation is so very great and manifest, there should be any
   appearance of declining these occasions, or of shyness in closing with
   them. We desire to bless God for it, that it is in the hearts of any to
   join us, but yet it cannot but be observed that there is too great a
   coolness; and many persons are easily diverted, it is to be feared,
   from closing with such occasions as these. And methinks it is more
   especially to be observed, that but few masters of families do appear
   before God, at such times and on such occasions; who might represent
   their families, and in the name of them come and lie prostrate at the
   foot of the throne of grace.

   Give me leave but to reflect upon a passage, which is not unworthy of
   our notice upon this occasion. They are the words of those idolatrous
   women that burned incense to the queen of heaven, who said to the
   prophet Jeremiah; "When we burnt incense to the queen of heaven and
   poured out drink-offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship
   her, and pour out drink-offerings unto her without our men?" Jer. xliv.
   19. Did not they come and fall in with us?' It is a sad case, if the
   men of our times cannot be as forward to fall in with the ways and
   methods of atoning God, and pacifying his displeasure against us, as
   they were in those days in ways pf so high provocation!

   4. Let us apply ourselves particularly and with great earnestness to
   supplicate the continuance of the Spirit, where it remains breathing in
   us; and the restoring it, where it had been in any measure restrained.
   O, how loud and importunate should our cries be upon this account! It
   is a fearful thing to lie under the guilt of continual vexation to the
   Spirit of God. You know there is a particular accent put upon such
   wickedness. You know there is such a thing as the sin against the Holy
   Ghost, in an eminent sense; and we had need to take heed of every
   gradual approach unto it. I do not think that every sin against the
   Spirit of God, is that sin against the Holy Ghost; but we had need, I
   say, to look to ourselves as to any gradual approach to it. For how
   great is the censure laid upon that sin! It is therefore a fearful
   thing to have our heart and way bent against the way and course, the
   tendencies and motions of the Holy Ghost.

   And when we consider the matter in this light, what reason have we to
   cry out, as we find the Psalmist does! "Cast me not away from thy
   presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me." Ps. li. 11. It is a
   great matter God hath against us, when he hath this to charge us with,
   namely the vexing of his Spirit. It is a part of the charge against
   Sodom, that they vexed Lot's righteous spirit. 2 Peter ii. 8. It is
   mentioned as a high aggravation of their wickedness that they vexed the
   spirit of a righteous man. But how much more heinous a thing is it to
   vex the Spirit of God! Is it (says the prophet Isaiah) a small thing to
   weary men, but will ye weary my God also? Isai. vii. 13. And the more
   we apprehend the heinousness of this matter, the louder should our cry
   be, "Take not away thy holy Spirit from us, that Spirit, which we have
   vexed, grieved, and done so much to quench." And to this purpose
   consider, before I conclude, these two things.

   (1.) The exigence of the case, and the necessity of having this Spirit.
   Alas! what will become of us when this Spirit is gone, quite gone and
   breathes no more? What do we conceive of ourselves, we that carry about
   with us bodies of flesh, animated by a living soul? What becomes of us
   when that spirit retires, and is gone? into what noisome putrid
   carcasses do we turn in a short time! and what a miserable carcass will
   that church become, out of which the Spirit of God is gone! a body
   without a soul! an unmoving breathless thing! If God should leave us
   the gospel, and the external frame of ordinances, what will that avail
   us when the Spirit is gone? The matter would be with us, as with some
   noble stately mansion-house, that is deserted of its great inhabitant.
   There you may come in, and walk from room to room, and find no body,
   where there was once great resort, and a great deal of splendour, pomp,
   and joy, but now, nothing but desolation! Such a thing will that church
   be, out of which the Spirit of God, the great Inhabitant, is gone. You
   might have gone to that ordinance and the other, and have met with
   life; but now no such thing; there are the empty rooms inhabited by no
   one.

   We should therefore so apprehend the exigence of the case, that our
   spirits may be awakened and stirred up, even with the utmost
   importunity, to obviate and avert, as much as in us lies, so great a
   calamity as this, and so great a death. The presence and influence of
   the Spirit would stand us in the stead of a great deal of mercy of
   other kinds. It was supposed, that to have ministers and teachers in
   the church would overbalance a great calamity, where it is said;
   "Though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of
   affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any
   more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers." Isai. xxx. 20. But how
   much external misery would it outweigh, to have this Spirit (so
   teaching as none does) remaining among us! So that it may well become
   us still to be praying; "Lord whatever thou doest, withdraw not thy
   Spirit from us! Rather tear our flesh, pour our blood like water upon
   the ground, than cease to be pouring out thy Spirit among us!" We
   should make this much the design of all our prayers on such a day as
   this.

   It may be, many are come before the Lord this day, to try to deprecate
   and avert that wrath, which threatens us with external calamities; or
   that they may do something for the saving their estates, and their
   pleasant delectable things: but this is a low design. Rather say, "Let
   all these things go, if thou wilt Lord, but let thy Spirit remain! let
   that breathe, and work in us still; and do with us, in all external
   respects, what thou wilt."

   Let us labour thus, I say, to apprehend the necessity of our case. It
   is not necessary that we should be rich, or in quiet, or at liberty; it
   is not necessary we should have such, and such external accommodations;
   but it is necessary we should have the Spirit: for they that have not
   the Spirit of Christ are none of his. Rom. viii. 9. And again,

   (2.) Apprehend too (wherewith I close) the possibility of succeeding
   well, in our strivings and wrestlings with God, yet to obtain more of
   his Spirit. It is itself a Spirit of grace, and supplication; and
   according as it is complied with in that, which is its proper business
   and office, so we may expect more and more plentiful effusions of it.
   We are therefore to look upon this -as a hopeful case, if we set
   ourselves to strive with God for his Spirit, that it shall not
   withdraw. But if it be an in different matter with us, then are we lost
   before we are aware. We feel death creeping upon us by degrees, and we
   regret it not; death drawing near our vitals, but we mind it not.

   This is a sad case; but if we, feeling a decay and languishment, cry
   with importunity to God, the case is not hopeless. He hath said, that
   he will give the Spirit to them that ask for it; and that he will pour
   out his Spirit upon us. Christ represents it as given to a child, as a
   boon from the Father; and that this gift is comprehensive of all good
   things. Matt. vii. 11. compared with Luke xi. 13. Nay, that the Spirit
   is to us, as bread to a child; for we can no more live without the
   Spirit, than a child can without bread.

   If we would therefore set ourselves a craving in good earnest, and
   represent our case to the Father of spirits and mercies, his bowels
   would work towards us; and he would not long with hold his Spirit from
   them, whom he sees to want it, and ask for it. Therefore beg of God
   thus: "O Lord, behold a poor company of creatures gasping for life! thy
   Spirit is vital breath; we are ready to die, if thy Spirit breathe not.
   Pity thine own offspring, thou Father of mercies, and of all spirits!"
   Surely then this Spirit will return; for why should not we rest upon
   his promise, who has said, that God will give his holy Spirit to them
   that ask him?

   And we may the more boldly ask, because we may suppose ourselves to be
   nearer those days, wherein there shall be a more general pouring out of
   the Spirit? And we might argue that those days are nearer indeed, if
   there was a more general, and importunate, and loud cry for this
   Spirit. This would import that a great measure of it is already come,
   and that far greater measures are coming. It would be an argument, that
   it would be a Spirit of consolation and joy, life and vigour; which
   would make religion a glorious thing, and Christians shine and live,
   both at once.

SERMON VI. [80]

   James i. 22.

   But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your
   ownselves.

   THE limits of my time, since I intend to discourse to you only this
   hour upon this scripture, will not allow me to reflect much upon the
   context; which is all suitable, and of the same piece with the words of
   the text itself. We have at the eighteenth verse a very high eulogy
   given us of the word of God, as that which is the divine seed and
   principle of the new birth; and out of which God's great and glorious
   work of the new creation doth result. "Of his own will begat he us with
   the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of his
   creatures." Whereupon the exhortation, "Be swift to hear," (ver. 19.)
   is grounded; that is, be very covetous of all seasons to wait upon the
   dispensations of this word. And then, at least, we come to this caution
   here in the text; "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only."
   Though hearing the word is the appointed means of this new creation;
   and is that, which by divine designation is able to save the soul of a
   man, by virtue of that efficacy which many times accompanies it from
   God; yet this is not to be understood, as if it should do any such work
   upon them, who only give it the hearing, and no more. And therefore the
   apostle thinks it seasonable, and necessary to give this intimation by
   the way, upon what terms we might expect so glorious an effect to be
   wrought by it: that is, supposing that we apply ourselves to attend
   upon it, with that earnest intention of the mind, as those who have a
   design to comply with, and to guide and govern their practice by the
   word they hear; otherwise all will come to nothing. "Be ye doers of the
   word, and not hearers only, deceiving your ownselves."

   We might recommend to you several propositions of divine truth from
   this scripture; but we shall choose to collect, and gather up all as
   much as we can into one, for the sake of greater dispatch, which you
   may take thus.

   That it is a miserable self-deception for any to be hearers of the word
   only, and not doers of it. And herein we shall speak to these three
   things, as previous to the improvement of it.

   I. Shew what it is to be a doer of the word.

   II. What to be a hearer only. And

   III. Wherein those, of the latter sort, do so miserably deceive
   themselves.

   I. We are to shew what it is to be a doer of the word. The expression
   plainly imports a habit; according as we denominate every person that
   is of such or such a calling or trade, from the course and way of life
   which he follows. A doer of the word, (poietai,) is not one that doth
   some single act, now and then, which the word enjoins or directs; but
   one whose wonted course, and the business of whose life it is to obey
   the dictates of this word, and who governs his life and the tenour of
   his actions by it. Just as we find the phrase of a worker of iniquity
   is, in the Old and New Testament, made use of to represent and hold
   forth to us the course of those persons, who trade in sin. They are
   said to be sin-makers, as the expression kakopoiountes doth
   emphatically note: their business is to work sin; and they do often
   exert their strength, and power that way. So we are to understand in
   general, a doer of the word of God; that is, one whose business of his
   life it is to do it in a continual course. And this supposes, and
   includes in it many things, which I shall briefly hint to you.

   1. It doth suppose a design, a formed fixed design, that this shall be
   my course. Accordingly we have the Psalmist speaking to this purpose;
   "I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous
   judgments: I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway,
   even unto the end." Ps. cxix. 106, 112. As if he had said, "I purpose
   and intend so to do; and this is an intention I resolve to pursue,
   throughout my whole course, from which nothing shall divert me." So in
   like manner when we attend upon the dispensation of the word, it should
   be with a settled design in our hearts, and a sincere purpose to learn
   somewhat in order to practice; to apply and accommodate to practice the
   truths we hear, and that are capable of being applied to this purpose.

   2. It carries with it a very serious applying of our minds to
   understand what is the mind and will of God, which is held forth to us
   in his word: that we content not ourselves to have heard such and such
   things propounded to us; but that we distinctly apprehend the scope and
   drift of what we hear, and what is the great thing aimed at in it. For
   we can never be doers of the word and will of God blindly, and in the
   dark. It is necessary that we understand and know it first. It is a way
   we are to walk in with open eyes. A good understanding (says the
   Psalmist) have all they, that do his commandments. Ps. cxi. 10. He
   supposes a good understanding as necessary to the doing the
   commandments of God. We cannot do them, without having a right
   understanding of them. These words do also imply (which seems to be the
   particular sense of them) that a good understanding will certainly
   incline a man to keep his commandments; and that the keeping his
   commandments will argue him to have a good understanding. And indeed he
   is the wise man that understands this to be his interest, and
   accordingly makes it his business to know, and practice the mind and
   will of God.

   3. It implies the use of our judgment in hearing the word, in order to
   distinguish what is divine, and what is human. For God hath thought fit
   that it should be so dispensed in the world, by such hands and
   instruments as may too possibly admit somewhat that is human into the
   dispensation of it. It is so sometimes merely as to the manner of the
   dispensation. There is nothing of this treasure that is conveyed to us
   by such vessels, but it will, some way or other, taste of the vessel:
   and that which we are principally to attend and mind, is t close with
   that which is most substantial, as supposing it to be altogether
   divine. It is also true sometimes that there may be some error as to
   the matter, as well as the manner. And there our desire ought to be of
   the sincere milk of the word, that we may grow thereby, even as
   new-born babes. 1 Pet. ii. 2. New-born babes have a kind of discerning
   if the milk he pure, or if there be any thing ill tasted or unsavoury
   in it. And there is a certain kind of taste and relish, which belongs
   to the new creature. "Cannot my taste (says Job) discern perverse
   things?" Job vi. 30. And this was the great commendation of the
   Bereans, That they searched the Scriptures in order to know, whether
   the things spoken to them by the apostles, were of God or no. Acts
   xvii. 11. And it was noted to be a piece of generosity in them. They
   were more noble than they of Thessalonica, upon this account. We are to
   make use of our judgment: as the apostle prays for the Philippians,
   that they might abound in judgment and all sense, spiritual sense; that
   so they might discern the things that differ, or approve those, which
   are more excellent. Phil. i. 9, 10.

   4. It requires a great deal of reverence to be used in hearing the
   word. So to hear it as that we may be doers, requires a very
   reverential attendance upon it; as considering, that this is a
   revelation that comes from heaven, some part of which is now to be held
   forth to us. It is a divine light, which, through such a medium, is to
   shine forth to us. And there is certainly altogether a fault in this
   respect, among a great many professors of religion; that the reverence
   is wanting, which is due to those sacred records that go under the name
   of God's word, and which he claims and appropriates to himself, as his
   word. I have wondered, I confess, to see how among scholars, and
   learned men, there should be so great a veneration for some or other
   notable pieces of antiquity, any aged volume, any old record; and how
   high a price and value have been put upon them. Now there is no such
   piece of antiquity as this in all the world that we know of. The holy
   Scriptures, at least a great part, are the most ancient writings in all
   the world. And it should challenge a mighty reverence and veneration,
   to have a word brought down, and transmitted to us, through so many
   successive ages. But to consider it as a divine word, a revelation come
   from heaven, doth much more claim our reverence. How strange a
   veneration did those Ephesians express for that image, which, they were
   made to believe, fell from heaven! All Ephesus, as it is expressed, is
   a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell
   down from Jupiter: (Acts xix. 35.) as if all the city were of a piece,
   all heart and soul upon that one thing, which they believed to be of
   heavenly descent. Now this word we are sure is a divine-breathed thing;
   for all Scripture is given by the inspiration of God. 2 Tim. iii. 16.

   Then it is that the word is like to be done, when it is received with
   reverence, not as the word of man, but of God: when we in our own
   thoughts prefix that preface to every part of that truth, which he
   himself hath prefixed to many parts and portions of it; namely, "Thus
   saith the Lord," who is the Lord of heaven and earth. It is his word,
   who made and sustains all things by the word of his power. When
   therefore we look upon this word as carrying the stamp of the majesty
   of God upon it, then it is like to command the heart; but it will
   signify little, till this is done.

   5. To be a doer of the word supposes that we believe it, or that our
   hearing of it be mingled with faith. It profits not where it is not so;
   and signifies nothing, if there be not that mixture. The word of God,
   says the apostle, works effectually in them that believe. I Thess. ii.
   13. But, as it is in another place, "The word preached did not profit
   them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it." Heb. iv. 2.
   And it is never likely that men should practice that word, which they
   regard no more, than the word of a child. If any one, whose truth you
   suspect, tell you this or that, it will signify little to determine
   your practice, or to guide and influence any design you have in hand.
   Now. to receive this word with faith, is to rely upon the authority of
   the Speaker, or him from whom it originally comes. "This is the word of
   God. There is no more doubt to be made of it, than whether the things
   be, or exist which I see with my own eyes." For it is faith that sup
   plies the room of sight, in reference to things that fall not under our
   eye. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things
   not seen. Heb. xi. 1. "God hath said this; and therefore it is as sure,
   as if my own eyes saw it all." The gospel is the power of God unto
   salvation, to every one that believes; but to them that believe not, it
   signifies nothing, it has no power with them. Again,

   6. It requires love; a great exercise of love that the heart may close
   with it. It is said of some, that they received not the love of the
   truth that they might be saved. 2 Thess. ii. 10. They had pleasure in
   unrighteousness. They had so much love to wickedness, that they had
   none for truth. Therefore they were left under strong delusions to
   believe lies, that they might be damned. So you find things are
   connected there. The love that is required here, is such as works out
   in sincere desire of the milk of the word, that so we may grow thereby.
   1 Pet. ii. 2. Also in delight; for the soul hath a sweet and savoury
   relish in it. "O how love I thy law!" (Ps. cxix. 97) says David: which
   was the name of that revelation of the mind and will of God then
   extant; and was sweeter to him, than honey to his taste. Ps. cxix. 103.
   Thy words (saith Jeremiah) were found, and I did eat them; and thy word
   was unto me the joy, and rejoicing of my heart. Jerem. xv. 16. The word
   of God is then like to be done, when there is so dear a love to it; and
   the soul so taketh complacency in it, and unites to it, that it becomes
   as it were consubstantiate with the soul itself. And again,

   7. It requires subjection; an obediential subjection to it, and
   compliance of heart with it. Receive with meekness (as it is in this
   contest) the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls. James.
   i. 21. There are many hearts of men so opposite to the word of God,
   that when they meet with that in, and from it, which is cross and
   adverse to their corrupt inclinations, their spirits swell, and storm
   and tumultuate; and they are ready to say with those in the prophet,
   The word of the Lord, which thou hast spoken to us, we will not hear.
   Jerem. xliv. 16. You must then receive it with meekness; that is, so as
   to yield to it, how cross soever it may be to any present disposition
   of yours. The word has been so received by gracious hearts, when it
   hath spoken terrible things. When dreadful things were foretold by the
   prophet to Hezekiah, he said; "Good is the word of the Lord, which thou
   hast spoken." Isai. xxxix. 8. Again,

   8. It requires a previous transformation of the heart by it, so as that
   the proper stamp and impress of it be upon the soul. For the word can
   never be done by the hearer, but from a vital principle; of which it is
   itself to be the productive means. So it is said to be in the
   eighteenth verse of this chapter, in, which is my text; "of his own
   will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of
   first-fruits of his creatures." If the new creature be not wrought by
   it in the soul, there will never be that doing of the word, which is
   expected and required. There must be an exemplar copied out from the
   word upon our hearts; and then we are to practice, and do according to
   that exemplar: still comparing it with the first idea, to be seen in
   the rule, or word itself. You obeyed (says the apostle) from the heart
   that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Rom. vi. 17. Or, as the
   words are capable of being read, into which ye were delivered. That is,
   you were cast into the very mould of the word; and have received the
   stamp and impress of it upon your souls, and so have obeyed it from the
   heart. Our Lord Jesus Christ in his kingdom (in that part of it which
   is more appropriate and peculiar) rules over a willing people and is
   not a king of slaves. He is obeyed with an inward inclination and
   propensity of heart. His power hath made his subjects willing; that is,
   by writing his law in their hearts, which is the great promise of the
   evangelical covenant. When souls are made the epistle of Christ, having
   his mind transcribed, and written out upon their hearts; then it is
   they obey, and do the word, and never till then. And then it requires
   also,

   9. A faithful remembrance of it; that is, of its rules accommodable to
   particular occasions as they occur. The apostle subjoins here in the
   words following my text a representation of the man that hears, without
   a design of doing the word; who says he, is like unto a man beholding
   his natural face in a glass: for he beholdeth himself, and goeth his
   way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. Jam. i. 23,
   24. If we apply the apostle's similitude fully unto the purpose for
   which he brings it, it must not only have reference to such an idea, as
   we have exhibited to us in the word; or the representation of what we
   now actually are, but also of what we should be, both together. Looking
   into the word as into a glass we have a representation made to us
   there, of the new creature in all the lively lineaments of it; and so
   we see what we should be: and comparing ourselves therewith, we see
   what we are; and wherein there is a deflexion, and disagreement from
   our pattern. They that do only throw a transient eye upon the glass, go
   away and forget what they see; the image vanisheth presently out of
   their thought. Therefore there must be a perpetual image kept up before
   our eyes, by a faithful and continual remembrance of what the word of
   God representeth to us; to wit, of the true complexion of a christian,
   and wherein our own disagreeth; that so upon all occasions we may be
   able to correct thereby what is amiss; and to direct our way and course
   according thereunto. And then there must be in the

   Last place, an actual application of all such rules in the word, to
   present cases, as they occur. Thy word I have kept in mine heart, that
   I might not sin against thee. Psal. cxix. 11. It is laid up in that
   repository and treasury for this purpose, to be used as there is need
   and occasion. Therefore so skilful ought we to be in the word of
   righteousness, which hath enough in it to make the man of God perfect,
   and thoroughly furnished for every good work; that upon all occasions,
   and whatever work we go about, we may have our rule still in readiness
   to apply, and actually may apply it to our case; so as neither on the
   one hand to walk dubiously, nor carelessly on the other. For those are
   extremes to be avoided. A continual scrupulosity is provided against by
   a continual acquaintance with the word, and having rules always in
   readiness to measure particular cases by as they occur; and, on the
   other hand, carelessness is inexcusable. For many walk without having
   any regard to their own spirits, and matter it not whether they are
   right or wrong. To have this word, as the measure of our lives, to
   apply to upon occasion, is necessary in order to avoid these
   exorbitances; the one whereof is so very uncomfortable, and the other
   so very dangerous, and destructive. But then we are,

   II. To speak to the other thing a little; namely, what is it to be a
   hearer only? By being a hearer only, we must not understand every thing
   to be excluded, besides the bare external act of hearing; as if no more
   were intended by it, than the outward act common to man with the brute
   creatures: for, undoubtedly, there may be included in it many acts of
   the understanding, and of the outward man. So to be a hearer only, is
   in the general to hear without any design of doing at all. For when it
   is required that we should be doers, the meaning of it is, not that we
   must be doers of all that is bidden and directed by the word, just
   while we are hearing. Therefore that which is required over and besides
   hearing, is a design to be doing the word; while, to be hearers only,
   is to hear without any previous design of acting according to what they
   do hear. Some other motives and considerations there are, which bring
   persons to hear; but as for the business of practice they intend it
   not. It never came into their minds to look upon that as the true and,
   proper end of hearing that they should do and practice what they hear.

   Now truth is but one, error is manifold. If there be but one right end,
   that end is to be aimed at, which is practice. And that we may be
   capable of this, but one entire frame and right disposition of soul is
   required. But various are the ends, and many are the ill principles and
   dispositions, which may have place in the spirit of a man in reference
   to this matter, It is, therefore, a manifold character, which I might
   give, if the time would allow, of the hearer only. For as there is a
   manifold end; and many indispositions, in the spirit of a man, to the
   true end: so manifold are the characters of such as are hearers only.
   Therefore we are not to suppose, that they all belong to one and the
   same person; but some to one, and some to another. There is,

   I. The inattentive hearer; that taketh very little heed to what he
   heareth. We ought (says the apostle to the Hebrews) to give the more
   earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we
   should let them slip. Heb. ii. 1 And set your hearts (says Moses) unto
   all the words which I testify among you this day. Deut. xxxii. 46. He
   that never intends to be a doer of what he hears, will very probably
   little regard what he hears.

   2. There is the inconsiderate hearer; that never ponders what he hears,
   nor compares one thing with another. I can but name particulars to you,
   which might well be enlarged upon. There is again,

   3. The injudicious hearer; that never makes any judgment upon what he
   hears, whether it be true or false. All things come alike to him, he
   matters them not. Consideration is in order to judgment, and judgment
   follows upon it. We deliberate first, and then judge upon that
   deliberation. The inconsiderate hearer, therefore, will be an
   injudicious one. There is also,

   4. The unapprehensive hearer: who hears all his days, but is never the
   wiser. Ever learning, but never comes to the knowledge of the truth. No
   light comes in to him, and he remains as ignorant after twenty years
   living under the gospel, as he was at the first.

   5. The stupid, unaffected hearer; that is as a rock and a stone under
   the word. Nothing ever enters or gets within the stony ground. Things
   are heard sometimes that even rend hearts all to pieces, if rightly
   disposed; things full of terror, amazement, astonishment, and of dread;
   but they are heard by these without any trembling. Rocks and mountains
   may shake and shiver sooner than they. Again,

   6. There are your prejudiced, disaffected hearers; who hear with
   dislike, especially those things which relate to practice: and with the
   greater dislike it may be, by how much the more what they hear, relates
   to the proper end of hearing. They cannot endure such things as aim at
   the heart, and concern the business and work of religion. And there are
   again,

   7. Your fantastical, voluptuous hearers; that hear only to please their
   fancy or imaginations. So they come on purpose to try if they can hear
   a pretty sentence, any fine jingle, some flashes of wit. For it may be
   they have found some, who have to do with this sacred word, that will
   allow themselves to be so vain, as to gratify them in such things, when
   they come with such an expectation. Of which temper I remember an
   ancient saying, Dissoluti est pectoris in rebus seriis quaerere
   voluptatem: it is a dismal token upon a person to seek for the
   gratification of his fancy in serious matters. As if one would bring
   music to another, that lay under the torture of a broken leg; how very
   incongruous would this be! And such we are to consider is the state of
   souls, all shattered, broken, diseased, and maimed. This is the common
   case of those we have to do with. [81] There are again,

   8. Your notional hearers; that are of somewhat a higher form and sect
   than the others: who do not aim merely to have their fancies and
   imaginations gratified by something light and flashy but their
   understandings also. But it must be by some fine notion, which they
   have not met with before. And so they always come to learn some kind of
   novelty; and if they cannot meet with some new thing, which they have
   not met with before, they go away with a great deal of dislike, and
   distaste, at those they hear. With these, (and they are for the most
   part of the same sort, and therefore we may join them together) you may
   put,

   9. Those talkative persons; who only come to hear that they may furnish
   themselves with notions for the sake of discourse: or that, when they
   come into company, they may have something just to talk of afterwards.
   Upon which a heathen moralist reflects with a great deal of ingenuity.
   "That is (saith he) when they hear such moral precepts as the
   philosophers use to deliver, and press in the schools; as all came into
   them in words, so, with them, all go out in words. Which is just the
   same thing, as if the sheep, when they have been grazing all day,
   should come at night to the shepherd; and cast up the grass they
   swallowed, to shew how much they had eaten. Grass it came in, and grass
   it goes out again. The shepherd does not expect this, but expects that
   of the grass they had eaten that day, there should come milk and wool
   from the concoction, and digestion of what they had eaten." It is much
   that we have need to learn such documents as these from a heathen.
   What! because all we hear comes to us in words, should it all come out
   in words again? No, the end is surely that it should be so digested,
   and concocted, as to yield work and fruit, agreeable to what we hear.
   And then there are again,

   10. The censorious and critical hearers; who come on purpose not as
   doers of the law, but as judges. They come to see what they may carp
   at, and so to pass their verdict. "Were such and such things rightly
   methodized? such and such words well placed? was there an exact
   concinnity in what was said?" and the like. This now is all the design
   they have in hearing the word. And then there is another sort too, and
   we have some experience, I am afraid, of too many such, in the age and
   day wherein we now live, and that is,

   Lastly, Malicious hearers; that come on purpose to seek an advantage
   against those, they come to hear, particularly from what they preach.
   By this sort, you know, our Saviour was often pestered: who came to
   hear him; and to put questions to him; and so gave him occasion to
   speak, only to entrap and insnare him. To which maybe added your raging
   exasperated hearers, such as Stephen's were at his last sermon; who
   gnashed upon him with their teeth, and could not forbear violence to
   his precious life, upon their hearing him. Thus you see the characters
   of those that are hearers only, which are various and manifold. I shall
   only touch upon the

   III. Thing, namely, to speak to the self-deception of such persons. And
   here I shall shew, wherein such are deceived; and the grossness of the
   deception itself.

   1. Wherein such are deceived. And they are certainly so,

   (1.) In their work. For they commonly think they have done well; and
   they find no fault with themselves, that they have been hearers only.
   And then

   (2.) As to their reward they are also deceived. They get nothing by it
   all this time. That, and their labour are lost. "Whoso looketh into the
   perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a
   forgetful hearer but a doer of the word, this man shall be blessed in
   his deed" Jam. i. 25. But they never go away with a blessing; most
   certainly they miss of it, who are hearers only.

   2. For the grossness of this deception, it will appear to be very
   great, if we consider,

   (1.) That they are deceived in so plain a case. For it is the plainest
   thing in the world, that the gospel is sent in order to practice. Now
   how strange is it, that men should fee deceived in a thing so plain!
   What can the gospel be sent for but only in order to practice? What
   other aim, or end, can it possibly have? As might be shewn in many
   particulars, if time gave leave. And,

   (2.) It is self-deception; for they are said to deceive themselves;
   which is a far other thing, than when the matter is Wont to be
   expressed passively only, and in softer terms. As to say to a person,
   "Sir, you are mistaken; you are deceived and imposed upon." This, I
   say, is much gentler, than to say of a man, that he deceiveth and
   imposeth upon himself. For this carries in it an intimation, that men
   do use some industry in the matter; that they industriously deceive
   themselves, as indeed it must be so in this case. For if men did not
   use some art or contrivance, they could never have hid these things
   from their own eyes; particularly, that this word is sent to be the
   guide of men's practice. And to overlook such a thing as this all their
   days, (as those men must be supposed to do who are hearers only) is
   miserable deception. It is their trade, and a poor trade the Lord
   knows! And they must be supposed to have used a great deal of artifice
   with themselves, to veil so plain a case as this from their own eyes
   and view; so as not to understand, that the gospel is sent to be their
   rule of practice, in order to their attainment of a happy state at
   last.

   And now, to shut up all with a little application we may learn hence,

   1. That persons are apt to overlook the main of their duty, and take up
   with some lesser parts.

   2. That in the very business of hearing the word, there is great danger
   of self-deception, if persons do not carefully watch against it. And
   again,

   3. We may learn, that the whole business of the gospel hath a designed
   reference unto practice. Be not hearers only, but doers of the word. As
   if he had said, Do not satisfy yourselves with merely hearing the word
   of God, as if there was nothing in it conducing, or referable to
   practice, as generally the things contained in it manifestly have; for
   this alone is not sufficient to answer the end and design of the
   gospel. Again,

   4. We may learn, that it is a duty of very great concernment to attend
   upon the word preached or to be a hearer of it; for the whole business
   of our practice is to be consequent thereupon. It is then of great
   consequence to be a hearer of the word; and as much as this duty is
   neglected by many, the whole stress lies upon it of the design and end,
   for which the gospel comes into the world. The gospel signifies nothing
   unless it be believed, and this "faith cometh by hearing." Rom. x. 17.
   There are many persons that humour and please themselves in talking
   against so much hearing, and so much preaching; and think it a vain,
   and needless thing. But that is certainly because they have little
   considered what hearing, and preaching are for. If it were only for the
   minister to teach, and the hearers to learn some new thing not known
   before, truly all necessary truth, by attentive diligent inquirers,
   might be learnt in a little while. But it is rather to urge and
   inculcate things, which were known before. Therefore when the apostle
   had said, that it is by the word of truth that we are be gotten of God,
   to be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures, he presently adds, "Be
   swift to hear." Jam. i. 18, 19. As if he had said, these things ought
   to be often urged, and inculcated upon you; that so the product
   thereof, to wit, the new creature may be sure in you. If this be not
   done at one time, it may at another; some time or other it may be
   effected. Therefore be swift to hear, your life lies upon it. But then,

   5. And lastly, You see of what consequence it is to add doing, to the
   hearing the word. And for that I need to give no other encouragement
   than that of our Lord at the close of his sermon on the mount.
   "Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them; I will liken
   him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock: and the rain
   descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that
   house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock. But, (says he,)
   Every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not; shall
   be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand: and
   the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat
   upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it." Matt. vii.
   24-27. And I cannot upon consideration of this but apprehend, that, as
   the stability of many (I hope) hath been promoted by the much
   preaching, and hearing of our times; so there are many (I am afraid)
   near to a very dreadful fall, who have been hearers only of Christ's
   sayings, but never minded to be doers of them.

   And I must needs think it strange, if we have not among us a general
   apprehension of the danger of losing our opportunities of hearing the
   word of God. We have these upon such terms, that we should, methinks,
   reckon ourselves always in danger. And if we have any cause for that
   apprehension, what in all the world can we imagine more provoking, and
   likely to infer such a doom and judgment upon us, as the penury of the
   word of God, than to be hearers only, without any design to be doers of
   it? Whereas if we did but set ourselves, with a more earnest design, to
   apply, and turn all that we hear, into fruit and practice; it may be
   this might prevent such a stroke as we are not without reason to dread,
   nor without grounds to fear. But if we should not prevent it, yet it
   would be a very comfortable thing however in a cloudy, dark and gloomy
   time, to be able to make such a reflection as this; "Blessed be God,
   while I had such seasons, I laboured to improve them as well as I
   could. I laboured to take all opportunities that I could, to hear with
   a design to do, to quicken and help me to move onward in Christian
   practice." It will, I say, be very comfortable to be able to make such
   a reflection in a time of gloominess and darkness which it is possible
   we may see, and how soon we know not. And if in such a season we should
   be able to make this reflection, it would be a happy provision for us
   against it. It would suppose us to have gotten some stock, some
   treasure within us, which we might draw forth. We should then have the
   word within us, which when we should lie down, rise up, or walk, might
   commune within us; and so we be capable of being preachers to
   ourselves.

   In a word, if ever we should come to such a state of things, that we
   should never see the face, nor hear the voice of a minister of God's
   word, where our lot is cast; if we should wear out our days in a
   wilderness, a desert, or a cave; it would be comfortable to have this
   word a companion to us, and ingrafted into us, which is able to save
   our souls: it would be comfortable, I say, to have a stock of divine
   truth to live upon, when we should, as to the external dispensation of
   it, be in penury and want. Let these things, therefore, move us to a
   more earnest endeavour to be doers of the word, and not hearers only.

   [81] The word here akroatai, hearers only may remind one (says the
   author) of an ancient word that is of affinity with it, namely,
   akroamata; of which this is the sense. It was the name of certain songs
   and sonnets, joined with vocal and instrumental music, which were wont
   to be used in the conclusion of stage-plays, wherewith the hearers were
   entertained at their going out of the theatres. They were also very
   frequently used in the close of banquets. Why! the word of God is
   looked upon as such an akroama, and the things contained in it as
   akroamata, so these [akroatai] kind of bearers. "Thou art," (says the
   Almighty to the prophet Ezekiel) "unto them as a very lovely song of
   one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for
   they hear thy words but do them not." Ezek. xxxiii. 32. Such hearers
   there are who come only to have their imaginations and fancies
   gratified with somewhat, that may be delicious to them; and that is all
   that they aim at. These sure are hearers only!

SERMON VII. [82]

   Luke xviii. 18.

   And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to
   pray, and not to faint; saying, There was in a city a judge, which
   feared not God, neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that
   city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. And
   he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though
   I fear not God, nor regard man; yet because this widow troubleth me, I
   will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the
   Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge
   his own elect which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long
   with them?

   MY purpose is not to give you a particular explication of this parable.
   The design of it is sufficiently seen in the application of it, which
   our Saviour here makes. All that I shall at present do shall be to shew
   you, with all possible brevity, the strength of the reasoning which our
   Saviour here useth, from the importunity and success of this widow; in
   order to encourage our addresses to God, and a continuance therein
   without fainting. And his argument to this purpose may be seen to be
   very strong and cogent if we consider these two things in the general.

   I. The parity of reason between the case he argueth from, and that
   which he argueth to.

   II. The superiority of reason, which is in the latter case, above the
   former. For so we must understand him to argue, partly a priori, and
   partly a fortiori. And the strength of the argument both ways we shall
   endeavour to make out unto you.

   III. We shall make application of the whole.

   I. I am to consider the parity of reason between these two cases; which
   you may conceive especially in these four things.

   1. That here was distress in the one case, and there is distress in the
   other. This widow comes to this judge in a very distressed case, as it
   should seem, though it be not particularly expressed; only it appears
   she was very much grieved, and that there was a great deal of wrong
   done her. And so in the other case, the elect of God are always very
   much injured; and they sustain a great deal of wrong from this evil
   world, in which they are. And surely if this unjust judge was moved
   with the distress of this suppliant, there is a great deal of reason to
   suppose, that distress will be moving in this case also; and that the
   elect will be heard, when they make their cries to heaven, urged by
   their own distresses.

   2. There appears to have been justice in the one case, as we are sure
   there is justice in the other. This widow's did appear to be a just
   cause. She comes with this request to the judge, that he would avenge
   her of her adversary. The wordEndikeson, there used, signifies, Right
   me of my adversary. She came to petition a matter of right, and all
   that she desired was to have right done her. And there is a great deal
   of right in the other case also. "It is a righteous thing with God
   (says the apostle) to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
   and to you, who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall
   be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels." 2 Thes. i. 6, 7. And
   again,

   3. There was importunity in the one case, and there is importunity in
   the other. Why then should not success be hoped to correspond in this
   case, as well as that? This widow was so urgent, that the judge was
   sensible of a grievance in it; and found a necessity upon himself to do
   her right, lest he should he wearied by her importunity. The elect too
   are represented as crying night and day; that is, the loud voice of
   their prayers is not by fits, only now and then, but is continued, and
   incessant; as night and day take in the whole complex of time. And do
   you think then, saith our Saviour, that God will not hear their cry?
   Besides,

   4. There is an obligation by office to do right, both in the one case,
   and in the other. The person, to whom this woman, applied herself, was
   a judge in the city. Now it is known, that in several of the more
   eminent cities of Israel, there were constituted stated judges, to whom
   all persons might have recourse, and bring their grievances, in order
   to their being redressed. So that this woman doth not come to a person
   unconcerned. She does not request, that an occasional kindness might be
   done her; as one might request such a thing of any one, when in
   necessity: but she comes to an appointed person, to one who by his
   office was obliged to right her. And God hath been pleased to take upon
   himself such an office, and to make himself known by the name of the
   Judge of all the earth; that all might know whither to apply, and to
   whom they may appeal and address themselves. And why is not right to be
   expected in this case, as well as in the other? So far this parable
   gives us ground to argue from a parity of reason. But,

   II. It gives us ground also for arguing from a superiority of reason
   too, in sundry respects. As,--In respect of the supplicants in the one
   case, and the other:--in respect of the persons supplicated in the one
   case, and the other: and--in respect of the supplication itself in the
   former case, and the lat ter compared.

   1. There is very prevailing and much stronger reason in the latter
   case, than in the former; if we consider the supplicants in both, and
   compare them. In the former case you have a poor woman; and here we are
   to consider,

   (1.) That she was a single woman, only one person who comes to make her
   complaint to this judge: but in the other case you have a community,
   the whole body of the elect. How vast is the disproportion here! This
   great body joining in one cry, surely that must needs be unspeakably
   more prevailing! And,

   (2.) (For we can but speak shortly to so many things as are before us)
   This was but an ordinary woman, of an inferior rank, by any thing that
   appears; that is, she is not mentioned here under any remarkable
   particular character, that might add weight to her cause and suit: but
   this community is a choice community; the elect; a community of very
   peculiar persons, that are severed from the rest of men, and
   distinguished by God's own special seal set upon them. As when God's
   portion in the several tribes was spoken of, there were sealed of such
   a tribe, so many thousands; and of such a tribe, so many thousands.
   Rev. vii. 4. &c. All God's elect ones, are sealed ones; they carry a
   mark of honour upon them. "The foundation of God standeth sure, having
   this seal, The Lord knoweth, them that are his." 2 Tim. ii. 19. And,

   (3.) The supplicant was unrelated to him, to whom she makes her
   supplication. We do not find, that she pretended to any relation to him
   at all; only comes to him as the judge of her city. But in the other
   case, the supplicants are God's elect; his own peculiar people that he
   had taken, and made nigh unto himself: "called, and chosen, and
   faithful," as you have those expressions put together in Scripture.
   Rev. xvii. 14. And do not we think then, that a more especial regard
   will be had here? Besides,

   2. There is a great superiority of reason in arguing from the one case
   to the other, if we consider the persons supplicated; or to whom the
   addresses are made in each case. In the general, in one case it is man;
   in the other, it is God. And particularly,

   (1.) In the former case it was a wicked profane person, to whom the
   address was made; one that did neither fear God, nor regard man: good
   to no one, neither to God nor man; a vile wretched creature, wrapt up
   within himself; who studied, and consulted nothing but his own ease,
   and peace; having no fear of God before his eyes, nor any regard to
   man. But in the other case, you have the holy God addressed to; whose
   natural, essential holiness, is a perpetual law and obligation to him,
   to do always that which is best. His essential rectitude cannot but do
   such things, as have an agreeable rectitude in them to his own very
   nature.

   (2.) In the one case it was a merciless man, that was applied to; in
   the other, a merciful God. How much stronger is the reason! This judge
   was a man who had no mercy, no pity to any one, but to himself. He took
   some pity of himself indeed, that he might not be wearied out with
   continual clamours and cries; otherwise, it seems, his heart knew no
   pity, there were no bowels of compassion rolling, or working in him.
   But in the other case, it is the Father of mercies who is addressed,
   and appealed to. It is he with whom there is so abundant pity, and
   kindness; so strong a propension and inclination to do good to the
   necessitous and miserable, only because his will inclines and leads him
   thereunto: the Spring and Fountain of all that pity and mercy, that is
   any where to be found, diffused among his creatures. If parents pity
   their children; if there lie bowels gathering in any towards the
   afflicted and distressed; from what spring, from what fountain did all
   this proceed? All must come from some original or other; and they can
   be derived from no higher, neither are they to be derived from any
   lower, than this great Father of mercies. And what! shall not he hear
   his elect? And again,

   (3.) It was, in the former case, an unjust man that was supplicated;
   here it is the just and righteous God. As his holiness doth oblige him
   in general to do that, which is right and fit to be done; his justice,
   as a particular attribute in his general character, inclines him in
   this case to administer, and execute justice. As he hath been pleased
   mercifully himself to lay down a rule and law of mercy, in reference to
   those that are his (though it be impossible that God can injure a man
   in any thing, yet it is possible that men can injure one another; and
   very certain also that those are the worst used by the world, who have
   such a near relation to him, and whom he hath chosen and gathered out
   of the world) so here in this case, when there is a proper object of
   vindictive justice, shall not the Judge of all the earth do right, to
   whom righteousness belongs as part of his peculiar glory? And then
   again,

   3. There is, in respect of the supplication on the one hand, and on the
   other, a great superiority, and triumphant prevalency of reason. For,
   in the former case, consider,

   (1.) The matter of the petition of this widow; and that was only a
   private good, that she sought for herself: and consider also the
   petition of the elect of God. They have all one common concernment,
   wherein the interest of God is involved with theirs. So that whatsoever
   they supplicate for, as the elect of God, must needs be a matter that
   is so far public; that is, wherein they all agree, and in which their
   hearts and desires do meet, and concur. It is one thing for a
   particular person to desire to be gratified in some particular, private
   concernments; and another thing to insist upon such matters as are
   common to us, with all the elect of God. And this it is to be supposed
   is the matter of the supplications of the elect unto God in this case.
   It is that, wherein all the elect do concentre and wherein all their
   desires do meet.

   (2) Look to the manner, and style of the supplication; on the one part,
   and on the other. This woman comes in her own name, but the
   supplications of the elect of God run in another style; they come all
   in the name of the great Mediator, and Intercessor. And is there not
   unspeakably more reason, that we should expect their supplications to
   prevail? They come in the name of him, who is most nearly related to
   the Judge, and to them. "We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
   Christ the righteous. 1 John ii. 1. It is said in definitely, with the
   Father: not of his, or our Father; but the common Father of him, and
   us, as we are to understand it. And since with him we have such an
   Advocate, shall we not hope to prevail? Again,

   (3.) Consider the principle of the one's supplication, and that of the
   other. We must suppose this woman's supplication to be dictated by her
   own sense of the urgency, and necessity of her case; and the
   unrelievableness of it by any other way than that of addressing herself
   to the known judge. In short, it was her own private spirit that
   dictated her supplication; for she alone knew her own need, felt her
   own necessity. But the prayers of all the elect of God have another
   principle. When they know not what to pray for, they are furnished with
   matter, and with sighs and groans at once. Rom. viii. 26. There is a
   spirit appointed on purpose, known by the name of the "Spirit of grace
   and supplications;" whose business it is to indite requests for the
   elect of God, and to strive and to wrestle with him: which is strongly
   moving at the same time in their own breasts; so as that their hearts,
   and the heart of God, as it were, are united, and joined by that
   Spirit. Shall they not then hope to prevail? They may say, when they
   are putting up such prayers as are the common sense of all the elect of
   God; "Lord, I do not speak of myself now. Thou hast taught me to pray.
   This prompts me to it, and puts me upon it; and I had never prayed so,
   nor uttered such cries: and such desires had not entered into my heart,
   if thou hadst not put them there." And shall not God hear his own elect
   offering up petitions of his own bespeaking? And desires of his own
   creating shall not he answer? Doth he stir up desires on purpose to
   disappoint them? or, will he make his people refuse to pray, by denying
   their petitions, and casting their prayers back upon their hands? And
   then,

   (4.) Consider the end of one's supplication, and that of the other. The
   end that this woman aimed at, was nothing but self-advantage, to be
   relieved herself; but the end of the elect of God in their
   supplications, is somewhat wherein their interest is jointly concerned
   with his in reference to those great concernments, which belong to the
   whole body. They know he hath a concern twisted with theirs; and so can
   speak it, with Daniel, as the real sense of their hearts, "Do, defer
   not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city, and thy people are
   called by thy name." Dan. ix. 19. This is the common sense of all the
   people of God: "Thou hast not been ashamed to be called our God. Thou
   hast taken us into a near relation unto thee. It is a grievous thing to
   be twitted with our God. It is as a sword in our bones to have it said
   to us, Where is your God? Thy concernments and ours are one; do
   therefore, and defer not for thine own name's sake." In this strain do
   all the supplications of the elect run. So that in all these respects
   you see there is a great superiority of reason, if such a widow should
   succeed well in her private request to such a judge, why all the elect
   of God should much more succeed in the requests, which they are day and
   night making to the great Lord of heaven and earth. And therefore,

   III. Briefly to apply all this, we learn;

   1. How great a privilege it is to have this matter clear to us, that we
   are of the elect of God; and how much therefore we are concerned to
   make our calling, and election sure; for then we find ourselves to
   belong to a community, that are continually praying prayers which shall
   be sure to prevail. And how great a privilege, how blessed a thing is
   this! Methinks when we understand how certainly the elect of God shall
   be heard, who are crying to him night and day; we should be at this
   work, night and day, poring into our hearts, till we are certain of
   this, that we are the elect of God. Then we shall be sure to put up all
   prosperous and acceptable prayers, when they are all of the same sense,
   and run in the same channel, as theirs are wont to do. And again,

   2. We are to collect hence, that the elect of God, as long as they
   continue in this world, are to bear the character of praying ones. To
   be acted by a spirit of prayer, and to have continually a praying
   disposition, is characteristical of the elect of God, who are gathered
   in from among the common refuse of a sinful world. Therefore we had
   need to look well to ourselves concerning this thing. How stand our
   hearts Godward? Are they formed unto prayers? Is it become even a
   spiritually natural thing to us to pray? As natural as breathing is to
   a living man, so natural a thing is praying to the new creature, and as
   agreeable. The elect are supplicants day and night. The great business
   of their lives is prayer. This is that, to which the heart of an elect
   person doth impel him; so far as he is himself, and hath the true
   genius and spirit working in him, which is common to all the elect of
   God, and also peculiar to them. And again, we are to learn hence,

   3. In how wretched a case they must needs be, who are the stated, and
   habitual enemies of the church of God in the world. It is a fearful
   condition that such men are in, to have all the elect of God crying
   against them, night and day. What will become of this matter at last?
   Who, that considers the case, would not dread to be found in such a
   condition as these are in? to be one against whom all the elect of God
   are joining their requests, night and day, and exhibiting complaints!
   For they do in common pray against the enemies of the name, and
   interest of God: and so every one is involved, and the cry of this
   whole community goes against each individual; that is, supposing them
   to persevere in a course of enmity to the interest of our Lord, and his
   Christ. So that this might make any heart to tremble, to think what
   this is like to come to, and what it must needs infer. What fearful
   storms of wrath and vengeance will be plucked down at length upon their
   heads, against whom all the elect of God are continually joining their
   requests! And, in the last place,

   4. We see hence, how unreasonable a thing it is to be despondent in
   prayer, or to faint in this duty, supposing that the things we mainly
   insist upon are the common concernments of the elect of God. This being
   supposed we pray securely. Indeed if we vainly and unwarrantably set
   our hearts upon this or that particular thing, that would gratify
   ourselves; and nothing will serve our turn, but that we be so and so
   gratified; we may pray, and pray, and all to little purpose: for there
   can be no acceptable prayer that is not the prayer of faith; and that
   can be no prayer of faith, which goeth beyond the bounds of the
   promise. Therefore, if I pray for that, which was never promised, I may
   thank myself if I succeed not.

   There are some things that cannot be the matter of a universal,
   absolute promise; being things which are in themselves of an uncertain,
   and variable nature: as all such things as have no intrinsic goodness
   of their own, but may sometimes be good to particular persons, and
   sometimes not. For circumstances may so vary the case, that the good
   that is in them may be preponderated by afar greater evil, if they
   should at that time be given. And whatsoever is a good of this nature;
   that is, good or not good, according as circumstances are, which often
   vary; it is apparent cannot be the matter of an absolute promise: for
   supposing circumstances so to vary, as that this should become an evil,
   you would then have evil to be the matter of a promise, which is
   contradictious and absurd. But since it is possible, that external or
   worldly good things, yea, and some also that may be externally
   subservient to religion, may in some circumstances do more hurt to the
   people of God, who does with a gracious care preside over their
   actions, and all things that have any respect to them, and who is best
   able to judge; they cannot, therefore, be the matter of his absolute
   promise. These things may be more hurtful, than gainful, in such and
   such circumstances; and he sees how to do them more good by the want of
   such things, than by the having of them. A less good, when compared
   with a greater, is then to pass under the notion of evil; and it would,
   I say, be unreasonable to suppose evil to be the matter of a promise.
   And where any thing of that nature is not promised absolutely, but with
   a reserved latitude to the wisdom, and goodness of our great Lord, and
   Ruler; our faith can be exercised no otherwise about them, than
   according to the tenour of such promises: that is, we may believe we
   shall have such and such things, if God seeth good; but if he seeth not
   good, he will deny, or withhold them, even in mere goodness and
   faithfulness to us.

   But then in such things as are absolutely promised to all the elect of
   God, there we may give room and scope to our faith. And it is an
   unreasonable thing to be at all desponding concerning the matter of
   such prayers: as it is, with respect to others also, no less
   unreasonable to admit the least doubt, that we shall have such things
   if they be best for us; and what God in his unerring wisdom discerns
   will be for our advantage. Therefore let us settle this apprehension
   with ourselves, of how great concernment it is to us in prayer, to
   insist on such things, as are properly of common concern to the whole
   fraternity of the elect; and therein to take heed of any diffidence, or
   distrust.

   Great and glorious things are promised to be the portion of God's elect
   in this world, at his own appointed time and season; but he hath not
   told us when that shall be. However we may, with this peremptory faith,
   go unto God in prayer, that he will make the kingdoms of the earth, the
   kingdoms of our Lord, and his Christ, who shall reign for ever and
   ever; that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established, above
   all the mountains; that there shall be new heavens, and a new earth,
   wherein shall dwell righteousness. But we make all this matter a
   private business, if we go and cry; "Oh let it be so now! let it be in
   my time, that mine eyes may see it!" especially if we peremptorily
   insist upon it; without reservation: or submission to the supreme
   wisdom and will. Whereas if we pray in general, that such things may
   be; our hearts should be full of hope, faith, and joy, in the
   apprehension that thus it shall be; and we cannot be without success,
   since it is the common sense of all the elect of God.

   And in matters, which respect the particular concernments of our souls,
   see that they be things of absolute necessity, and that fall within the
   consent of all the community. Let us pray against the body of sin and
   death; that we may have grace kept alive, and maintained and improved;
   that we may grow, and be carried on from strength to strength, till we
   reach "the measure of a perfect man in Christ Jesus." This is the
   common sense of all the elect; and our prayers fall in with theirs, who
   have been, wont to cry out against the body of sin and death, as the
   great and most violent enemy they would be rid of. We may then be sure
   that our prayers shall have effect, and not be lost; and that God will
   certainly hear them.

   If we are praying for the divine presence; he hath promised that he
   will never leave, nor forsake those that cleave to him. Heb. xiii. 5.
   Whatever he may do to people in common, he will never break the bond
   between himself, and that soul which is one of his elect; and when they
   cry, "Lord never leave me, nor forsake me!" they shall be sure to be
   heard. When we pray for the divine presence to be afforded more
   especially to us, in reference to some special case, or season of
   trouble and trial, this is what God will not fail to do. If his
   presence be desired, I say, as to any special duty; so it will be, and
   God will hear us.

   I hope you are desirous, and earnest in your prayers to God, for his
   more immediate presence, in reference to that special season of your
   approaching to the Lord's table. Sure all the elect of God have been
   wont to do so, praying and striving that they might at such times and
   seasons meet with God; that there might be a real intercourse, between
   their souls and him (whom they love) to such a degree as to him seems
   best. Why, God will hear all these cries, that are common to us, with
   all the people of God; and such prayers being directed to him, shall
   not be in vain. Therefore we should take heed, upon these accounts,
   that we faint not.

   We must know that fainting may be either when faith languisheth, or
   desire. It is faint praying, when we pray as if we cared not whether we
   prayed or no. The word ekkakein here rendered faint, in our text, is
   the same with that, which else where is rendered weary. Let us not,
   ekkakomin, be weary in well-doing; for in due season we shall reap if
   we faint not: (Gal. vi. 9.) that is, if ye be not sluggish in the
   course of well doing. Take heed therefore of praying the sluggard's
   prayer, or at the sluggard's rate. "The desire of the slothful kills
   him, because his hands refuse to labour." Prov. xxi. 25. His own
   desires carry no life in them; they are even death to his very heart;
   cold things that strike death into the soul, and put no life into it.

   And then too when faith languisheth, it is faint praying. "Let not that
   man," (says St. James) that is, the man who wavers like a wave of the
   sea, and is driven of the wind and tossed; "think that he shall receive
   any thing of the Lord." Jam. i. 7. What! come to God, as if we did not
   expect to get any thing by God! and as if we agreed in the same sense
   with those profane atheists, and symbolized with them who say, "What
   profit is it that we have prayed to him or kept his ordinances?" go
   heartlessly into the divine presence; give way to a cold, dull spirit,
   in the very performance of the duty; and never look after the success
   of it when it is over. Such had as good never pray at all, who pray
   only to keep up a custom, and to make a shew; and that they may be able
   to say when all is over, "The duty is done." Let not such think they
   shall receive any thing at the hands of God; such especially as come to
   him with no expectation, and pray to him as to one that can not save.

   It is to cast infamy upon the great Object of our worship; as if we
   were only blessing an idol, when we pray to the true, living God, as if
   he were such a one as the idols of the Gentiles are said to be, that
   have eyes but see not, ears but hear not, and can neither do good nor
   hurt. It is no wonder if such praying signify nothing; for it carries
   an affront in itself. Every such prayer is an indignity, and an
   insolent affront put upon the great God: as if the injunction of this
   duty upon the children of men, was either unreasonable and to no
   purpose, and so a reflection upon the wisdom of his law, who has
   commanded us to pray; (inasmuch as that is always unwisely enjoined
   that hath no end) or, as if there were no power in him to accomplish
   what we come to him about, though we come according to his own
   direction. It cannot, I say, but be an affront to God, either way, to
   come to him with desponding hearts. In the former case, if our desires
   languish, we are worse than the importunate widow; in the latter case,
   if faith languish, we make God worse than the unjust judge.

SERMON VIII. [83]

   Rom. v. 5.

   --Hope maketh not ashamed--

   IT will not be impertinent or unuseful to say something, from this
   scripture, concerning this property of the Christian's hope; namely,
   that it maketh not ashamed. But let us first, briefly consider the
   scope and series of the apostle's discourse here, and see how this
   passage depends and is introduced.

   We have here, after a long discourse touching our justification by
   faith in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, some account of the
   privileges of a justified state in the beginning of this chapter. As
   first, peace with God. "Being justified by faith we have peace with
   God, through our Lord Jesus Christ." Ver. 1. And secondly, free access
   unto God, and the liberty of his presence. "By whom also we have access
   by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the
   glory of God." Ver. 2. In which words we have also the patient, joyful
   expectation of the glorious state, that was designed for the people of
   God hereafter. And finally, cheerfulness in a present afflicted
   condition, is represented by the apostle as another privilege. And not
   only so, but we glory in tribulation also. Ver. 3. It was no such
   strange thing, that they should be found exulting in the expectation of
   so glorious a state, as that which Christians look for hereafter; but
   we have this also to say (saith the apostle) concerning our case, that
   we can glory in tribulation too, and triumph over all the difficulties
   that accompany an afflicted condition. And of this, as having something
   of a paradox in it, and appearing more strange he giveth the particular
   grounds and reasons. As

   First: The knowledge of this truth, that tribulation worketh patience.
   Ver. 3. We are, as if he had said, well pleased, yea, and do even glory
   in our present afflicted condition upon this ground, that we know, by
   this means, that patience will be wrought out, We look upon it as a
   thing of very high value, that the mere hope of so much gain should
   make persons glory in such tribulations, which seemingly call for other
   affections. Tribulation is not a pleasant thing to be gloried in of
   itself; why then, or upon what account is it to be gloried in? Why,
   upon this account, as that out of it the gain of patience shall accrue,
   and result to us. By this we shall have our spirits composed to a
   peaceful acquiescence in the divine will, and the waywardness of our
   own wills shall be subdued and brought down. There is a future heaven
   to be enjoyed, a glorious heaven; and we rejoice in the hope of the
   glory of that state: yea, and there is a present heaven too involved,
   and wrapt up in patience. When once the heart comes to be resigned, and
   rest quietly and peacefully in the divine will, this is a present
   heaven; and bears a great resemblance to that which is future, and
   expected.

   Secondly: The apostle adds, that of this patience there will be a
   further gain, to wit, of experience. Ver. 4. As patience comes to be
   more and more exercised experience will grow. And,

   Thirdly: Of that experience shall spring hope, (ver. 4.) that shall
   reach and touch the other heaven; hope, as he had said before, of the
   glory of God: (ver. 2.) even such hope as will not make ashamed; and
   that for this reason, because (saith he) the love of God is shed abroad
   in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. Ver. 5. While
   we find, by the Holy Ghost that is given to us, an effusion of the
   divine love into our souls; while we find this love shed abroad in our
   hearts, and then testifying itself, as if there was an immediate
   assurance of heaven; this puts us out of all doubt that God will never
   let our hope be disappointed nor end in shame.

   This is the order and contexture of the preceding discourses. And as to
   this passage that we have chosen to insist upon, we need not go about
   to vary the words, which you see are short and plain; "Hope maketh not
   ashamed:" only it is needful to inquire,

   I. Of what this is spoken. And then consider,

   II. This particular property of it.

   1. Let us inquire of what this is spoken, or what it is that doth not
   make ashamed. It is here indefinitely said to be hope. But though it is
   so generally expressed, yet, it is plain, it is not meant of all hope.
   The circumstances of the text are sufficiently limiting, and teach us
   of what hope this is to be principally understood. It is hope of the
   glory of God; it is hope that groweth out of experience; it is hope
   that is maintained by the love of God, shed abroad in the soul, through
   the Holy Ghost given to it. It is in short then undoubtedly the
   Christian hope that is here meant; and whereof we find this is
   expressed, that it maketh not ashamed.

   If you would have a more distinct account of this hope, take it thus:
   It is that sanctified affection of a renewed soul, by which it is
   carried continually to expect what God hath promised, concerning its
   own welfare and blessedness here, and especially hereafter;
   notwithstanding whatever difficulties do occur in the pursuit, and
   expectation of those things hoped for. And if you would know what it
   superadds to common hope, or what there is in this Christian hope of a
   distinguishing, peculiar nature; it superadds,

   1. Sanctity. A true Christian hope, is a pure and holy hope. It engages
   them that have it, to purify themselves even as God is pure. 1 John
   iii. 3. And again it superadds,

   2. Solidity. That which a christian hopes for, is some so lid
   substantial good thing. He hopes not for shadows and lying vanities.
   They who lived in the exercise of this hope, to whom the author of the
   epistle to the Hebrews speaks, had before them the prospect of a better
   and enduring substance in heaven; (Heb. x. 34.) a substance that would
   never fail their hope. There is a kind of hope that runs all in the
   chase of trifles, for the most part. Men hope for things, which they
   cannot have; and if they had, were to very little purpose. It
   superadds,

   3. Certainty. Men that hope at the common rate, do but hope
   conjecturally; and therefore their hope often maketh ashamed. Even at
   present they frequently outlive their hopes, they being pitched mostly
   upon things that are temporary. They hope for that, which is swept away
   like a spider's web. It is a most vanishing, uncertain hope. But if
   they should cast their eyes on futurity, that future happy state of
   things beyond time, they have no real ground to entertain any hope of
   it; or if their hope relate to present things, it is merely
   conjectural, and self-founded. God hath given them no ground for this
   hope. He hath not promised them, that they shall be rich; live a long
   life, and spend all their days in prosperity here. There is that
   strange kind of monstrousness in the common hope of men; that whereas a
   christian hopes, be cause God in his word hath promised, who cannot
   lie; they hope, even with reference to these their greatest
   concernments, because they think he will lie. For if they believed that
   he would not lie, but that all was true that he had promised and
   spoken; they would be in despair: they would with respect to these
   concerns, have no hope at all, but the horror of despair. Besides,

   4. Which is another distinguishing circumstance of the christian's
   hope, every such person hath a community belonging to it. The Christian
   hope is common to them that are Christians, in which they all unite and
   meet: whereas in reference to the hope of other men, there is no such
   thing as a centre in which their hopes may unite and meet; and so they
   lie scattered, according as their own inclinations, and appetites carry
   them. Falsity is various, and manifold; truth can he but one. And
   therefore says the apostle, concerning the hope of Christians, "There
   is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your
   calling." Eph. iv. 4. All the hearts of Christians do run into one
   hope; they meet in one and the same hope, the ground of which is that
   they are called to one, and the same state; and this call will warrant
   their hope, and justify it. "Why should not I hope to reach the state
   to which I am called? and why should not I attend to the affairs
   relating to that state? May not a man be warranted in things relating
   to his calling? This is my calling (saith the christian) and I hope
   for, and expect success." He can answer it to all the world, be the
   things never so great and high of which he is in expectation. They are
   very great things we hope for, but however to such things we are
   called. God hath called us to his eternal kingdom and glory by Christ
   Jesus. 1 Thes. ii. 12. This calling is not peculiar, or particular to
   persons severally; but the same unto all that are called, whose hope is
   one. There is a community, whose hearts as they run one way in desire,
   so do their hope and expectation; and their faith too being one common
   principle among them, they must needs have one common hope of the glory
   of God. Now concerning this hope which is proper to the Christian
   community it is said, that it maketh not ashamed; which we are now to
   speak to in the

   II. Place, And as to this property of the Christian hope, which we now
   proceed to consider, we have only two things to do;

   1. To open the import of it: and,

   2. To demonstrate the truth of the assertion; or to shew how
   necessarily this property doth agree to the Christian hope, namely,
   that it maketh not ashamed.

   1 We are to open the import of this property of the hope of Christians,
   which maketh not ashamed. Not making ashamed, is a negative expression
   denoting, that those who admit or give place to this hope, and in whose
   hearts it lives, and is fixed, are not liable to be made ashamed on
   this account. Now to make out this, there must be a concurrence of
   several things, which we must understand to be denied by this same
   negation: or that do not belong to the hope of Christians. As,

   (1.) Shame, as it refers to the foregoing hope implies disappointment.
   There may be shame upon many other accounts, but as it refers to hope
   it implies a disappointment. They were confounded (as the expression is
   in Job) because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
   Job vi. 20. Job is speaking there allusively to a troop of travellers,
   or merchant men, passing through desolate countries, and expecting
   relief of which they fail, and meet not with. They were ashamed because
   of their hope; that is, because they had hoped, and were disappointed;
   they met not with what they hoped for.

   (2.) It supposes hereupon disgrace and reproach. For shame is properly
   the resentment of any thing under the notion of its being ignominious,
   or that carries matter of reproach in it to us. We find therefore these
   in conjunction sometimes in Scripture; to wit, reproach, shame, and
   dishonour; Psal. lxix. 19. and elsewhere. Now in this present case; to
   have hoped, so as to suffer disappointment, is an argument of weakness,
   and so is apt to spread a shame over a man's face, and even to clothe
   him with confusion. A man reckons it a reproachful thing to him to have
   betrayed his impotence, want of foresight, an aptness to be gulled and
   imposed upon in this respect; and very shameful that he should hope
   with no more security. When a person has cause, and apprehends that
   others have also of censuring him, concerning the hope that he had,
   there it is that shame takes place. But this we must understand to be
   denied here. This hope, which the apostle speaks of, shall never meet
   with a disappointment; and consequently no reproach, nor disgrace,
   shall attend the hoper. He shall never have cause to call himself fool,
   because of his hope; nor shall any one else have cause or ground to
   call him so for ever.

   (3.) Shame doth also imply our own reflection upon that reproach; or
   else there is no actual occasion of shame, if we do not consider in our
   minds, or view the reproachful thing we are to take shame for.
   Therefore when the matter is such as only in vulgar estimate is
   shameful, but is not so indeed; to fortify one's self against shame in
   that case, is to overlook it, or look another way. So it is said of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, that he "endured the cross, despising the shame."
   Heb. xii. 2. Because it was to him no shame, he overlooked it, and
   looked upon it with contempt. "This will be counted a shameful thing,
   but I mind it not." He looked another way, having his eye set upon
   glory. If any thing be really matter of shame, it is by reflecting on
   it that shame ensues. But this is denied here. In this case there shall
   be no occasion to pore and look on, so as that from thence matter of
   reproach may accrue to you that have hoped for the glory of God. Let
   not your hearts misgive you; you shall have no uncomfortable reflection
   for what you have done in this matter. As there shall be no reproach,
   so you shall imagine none. And

   (4.) Shame includes in it a heart-dejecting resentment hereupon. That
   is, a resentment seizes the heart upon this reflection, and sinks into
   the soul so as to depress it, and bring it low. Shame is grief; only
   distinguished from other grief by this particular distinction in the
   object, that it is grief for a thing under the notion of its being
   uncomely and ignominious. But that is denied here. Hope maketh not
   ashamed. You shall never grieve for this hope. You shall never suffer
   heart-displeasure on this account. Your hope shall never leave your
   heart to sink, because it fails and comes to nothing.

   This now is the negative import of this property of the Christian hope;
   it maketh not ashamed. But then there is some what positive implied
   under this too. We may fitly under stand a meiosis, as they call the
   figure, in this expression; that is, when less is said than is intended
   or meant. Your hope, Christians, shall not make you ashamed. No, it
   shall make you exult; it shall make you triumph, and glory; it shall
   raise, and heighten your spirits, so far shall it be from occasioning
   in you a sinking or dejection of soul. This is very common, in
   Scripture, for negative expressions to be put with an accent, to
   signify some very great positive thing. Thus it is said of the Messiah,
   that "he shall not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking
   flax;" (Isai. xlii. 3.) that is, he shall cherish and support it.
   Again, (f his commandments are not grievous," 1 John v. 3. Here also a
   great deal less is said, than meant; for they are glorious,
   consolatory, and refreshing. "Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and
   all her paths are paths of peace." Prov. iii. 17. This then must be
   understood to be the property of the christian's hope, that it is so
   far from making ashamed, or exposing him to ignominy, that it ennobles
   his spirit; and that it does according to the nature and degree of the
   thing hoped for.

   It is obvious to observe how the hopes of persons, by degrees, greaten
   their spirits from their childhood. There is in some an aptness to mind
   greater things, and to live at a greater rate than others. And this we
   call generosity, it being not a name from the descent, but from the
   temper of the mind. It not only shews itself by men's being descended
   from noble and generous parents and ancestors (though there may be
   something in that too) but when such persons as are born to greater
   things come to understand their capacity, and what they are born to,
   their hopes do heighten or raise their spirits, and lift them up above
   the common pitch. So that the proper spirit of a nobleman, a prince, or
   a king, is greater than that of a common, and inferior man. And the
   reason is, because as he comes to understand his quality, his spirit
   grows with his hopes of what he shall come to; his very hopes greaten
   his spirit, ennoble and raise him, and make him think of living like
   one that expects to be in such a state, as that to which he is born.
   Therefore if a prince should be reduced in his infancy to that
   condition as to be brought up in a beggar's shed, and under stand
   nothing of his birth; it is likely he would mind such things, as
   children of peasants use to do: but if he afterward come to understand
   the truth of his own original and descent, and what he was really born
   to; and withal what his capacity is, and the ground of his hope that he
   shall one day inherit such and such grandeur and honours ] with this
   hope his spirit will swell, and rise, and greaten.

   And such is the property of the christian's hope. It not only makes him
   not ashamed; but it heightens, enlarges and greatens the christian's
   spirit, so as to make him aspire high, and to look for great things.
   Hence it is given as the description of them, to whom God will give
   eternal life, on that day when he shall give to every one according to
   his deeds; that they are such as, "by patient continuance in
   well-doing, seek for honour, glory, and immortality." Rom. ii. 6, 7. To
   these he will give eternal life; but to those that are contentious,
   against the plain truth of the gospel which should rule and govern
   them, will he give "tribulation and anguish, indignation and wrath."
   The former sort, who shall have eternal life for their portion, are
   such, whose minds, hearts, and hopes are carried after great things;
   who seek for honour, glory and immortality; who disdain and scorn this
   earth, and all sublunary things, and can say, "non est mortale quod
   opto; I have something above, better than, and beyond all that this
   earth can afford."

   In a word, a true christian is one that seeks that better, even the
   heavenly country (Heb. xi. 16.) so as not to stoop to this world though
   there were never such opportunity for gaining it: he would not go back,
   though he had the opportunity of going into Egypt. And all this is by
   reason of the hope of coming to a better country. The christian would
   not go back into the world, being called out of it; though he should
   have opportunities for it as good as other men: no, because he is
   seeking a better country; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called his
   God. "Such are of a great, a noble, and generous spirit, like my
   children;" saith God. "Such are in some measure worthy of me. They
   discover something of an excellent spirit, heightened proportionably to
   those great hopes which I have set before them." And now,

   2. We proceed to demonstrate this to be the true property of this same
   subject; which will be soon done, though we have but little time, if we
   do but consider these things about this hope.

   (1.) Consider the Parent and Author of it. It is a divine thing, it is
   part of the new creature, it owes its rise immediately to the Holy
   Ghost; as the apostle intimates, when he says, "Now the God of hope
   fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in
   hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost." Rom. xv. 13. Far be it from
   us to think, that God should beget a hope in his, that should end in
   disappointment and shame!

   (2.) Consider the object of this hope. Christians do not hope for
   creeping shadows; they have no reason to be ashamed of such great
   things, as they hope for. They hope for the glory of God, for a kingdom
   that shall not be shaken, for the unseen things of the other world.
   Their hope entereth into that with in the vail, whither the forerunner
   is for us entered, even Jesus. Heb. vi. 19, 20. A man that hath only
   pitched his hopes upon mean, base, low things, hath cause to be ashamed
   that he was such a fool to hope so; but the christian's hope will never
   make him ashamed.

   (3.) Consider the ground of their hope. They hope in God upon the
   encouragement of his truth and promise. Uphold me according to thy
   word, that I may live; and let me not be ashamed of my hope, saith the
   Psalmist. Psal. cxix. 116. Thy word is that which I ground my hopes
   upon; shall I be ashamed? I hope in thee, thy truth, thy power, and
   goodness; let me not be ashamed. That prayer is as much as a promise,
   that he should not be ashamed. Prayer, by divine inspiration is as good
   as a promise. The prayer is, Let none that wait on thee be ashamed.
   Psal. xxv. 3. The promise is expressly, They shall not be ashamed that
   wait for me. Isai. xlix. 23. It is true, indeed, if there were not a
   proportionable ground for one's hope, a man might be ashamed of his
   hope; as well because it is too big, as because it is too little. But
   if there be a real ground for it, a word of promise from that God who
   cannot lie; then there is no cause to suspect the matter. There is no
   reason why any should be ashamed, let his hope be never so high, when
   he hopes only for what God has promised.

   Now to make some brief use of what has been said.

   1. See the highly privileged state of christians; though in this
   present condition of little and low enjoyments, yet their case is so
   good as that they shall not be ashamed. They shall have heightened
   spirits, their minds shall be greatened by their hopes, even while it
   is little that they can enjoy in one kind or another.

   2. Hence consider and contemplate the different state of other men. It
   is not said, concerning their hope, it shall never make them ashamed.
   There is no body that warrants their hope to them. The christian's hope
   hath a very good warrant. I warrant you for your hope, that it shall
   never make you ashamed; but what have other men to warrant their hope?
   they have no one that undertakes to guarantee it, and therefore they
   are left liable to a shameful disappointment, and bitter disgrace upon
   that account. Yea, they are not only liable thereunto, but it is a sure
   and certain matter that it will end so; for "Their hope shall be as the
   giving up the ghost." Job. xi. 20. We commonly say, "As long as there
   is life there is hope;" but their hope comes at length to the giving up
   the ghost, and then the man is gone. A wicked man's hope quite vanishes
   away; it does not remain weak, and feeble, and in firm only, but it is
   absolutely gone, and become nothing at all: as we have no hope at all
   concerning a person, when he hath once given up the ghost. Let the
   object of their hope be what it will, either such do hope for vain
   things, which are gone when they expire; or if their hope lies towards
   better things, it is a vain hope. If they hope not for vain things, yet
   they hope for these better things vainly, having no ground nor reason
   for their hope; and so still it perishes, and, as the giving up the
   ghost, comes to nothing. Or it makes them ashamed, and despised; sinks
   them into horror, amazement and consternation, and so much the more, by
   how much the stronger was their hope. Such a disappointment is a most
   confounding thing; when a person expects it should go well with him,
   yet he perishes, and all his hope turns on a sudden into horror!

   3. We learn hence also, that hope must needs be a very great thing in
   the life of a christian; and a most intimate, essential part of his
   Christianity. It is that which holds his soul in life. This property of
   hope, that maketh not ashamed, as Was said before, is not to be
   understood as merely negative: It is that which establishes the heart;
   invigorates, and gives life to the soul. Indeed you would make a poor
   thing of Christianity, if you abstract and separate this hope from it.
   "If in this life only (says St. Paul) we have hope in Christ, we are of
   all men most miserable." 1 Cor. xv. 19. The most peculiar and
   distinguishing things in the hope of a christian, objectively taken,
   are things beyond time. But if all we were to get by Christ were to be
   compassed within time, then we were very miserable creatures indeed; we
   should make a bad bargain of it, if we had no more by Christ, than what
   time can hold, and deal very poorly by ourselves.

   A christian lives by hope all along, from first to last. He is born to
   hope, begotten of a lively hope, [84] is saved by it; [85] as if it had
   been said, he were lost if it were not for this hope. This then is the
   great, the momentous thing in the life of a christian; for if it were
   not for this, we should sink and perish. So that if I am a christian
   indeed, if I am a new creature, I must live by hope all my days. And
   that I may shut up all, I shall only leave with you a word or two of
   counsel, and caution.

   (1.) Of counsel. Labour to establish in your hearts this hope, and
   maintain it; and live by, and upon it. But I can not enlarge upon this.
   And then,

   (2.) By way of caution, I add; be sure that your hope be the truly
   Christian hope only: that hope, whereunto you can entitle the Holy
   Ghost as the Author, so as that hereupon we may say, we are begotten by
   him to that hope. And also see to it, that it be just commensurate with
   Scripture grounds. That is genuine Christian hope, that measures with
   the Scripture, and the word of promise. "Remember (says David) thy word
   unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope." Ps. cxix.
   49. Then you will hope for nothing, but what God has promised; and in
   the way, and according to the tenour of his promise. And you need to
   hope for no more, for. he hath promised to give grace and glory, and to
   withhold no good thing from them that love him. Ps. liiiiv. 11. And
   what would you have more? what need your hope to range beyond that, or
   without the compass of this promise? But then it must be according to
   the tenour of his promise; for if you hope absolutely for that which is
   a matter only-of a limited promise, then your hope would be beside its
   ground, and so be liable to disappointments.

   And you must know there are things which lie within, the promise, that
   cannot be the matter of an absolute hope; because God's promise,
   concerning them, is not absolute. As. to temporal good things; outward
   prosperity to ourselves, or the church of God in common; there is no
   absolute promise of these: therefore if we hope for them absolutely, we
   deceive ourselves, and it is our own fault if we be made ashamed. Who
   bid us hope so? who bid us let our hopes run that way, otherwise than
   as God commands, or beyond what he has promised? We may hope absolutely
   for things, that are of an immutable goodness; but some things are not
   so, and are only to be estimated according to their end. Sometimes they
   will serve the end that God designed them for, and sometimes not; and
   when they do not, they are not good, but evil. External prosperity to
   the church of God, or ourselves, will not always be serviceable to the
   end, for which it is designed by God; to wit, to make our spirits
   better, and more of the temper which he looks for, and approves: and he
   always knoweth whether it will be best for that end or no. Now if we
   suppose an absolute promise for any variable good things, which are
   sometimes good and some times not; then take the time when they are not
   good, and can they be the matter of a promise? No sure; the promise
   would in that case, be turned into a threatening.

   This then shews the reason, why it is altogether impossible that
   promises, concerning external good things, can ever be universal and
   absolute. They are not always good, but only as circumstances are. But
   from the nature of the thing promised we may be at a certainty how the
   promise is to be understood; that is, in reference to divine wisdom.
   Such things as do appear good for us, to that unerring wisdom, in
   certain circumstances, shall be bestowed upon us; and if we so order
   our hopes, they will never fail us, for no good thing will God with
   hold from them that love him. But when there is a doubt in the case,
   whether it be good or no, there is all the reason in the world he
   should decide the doubt, and we should yield a matter of dubious
   consequence to him. But if our hearts be so set upon any temporary good
   thing, as that such savour more with us, than those things which run
   into an eternal state; this we ought to guard ourselves against. As
   suppose it should be more consolatory to me, to be assured of present
   deliverance or prosperity, than to be told of being at the resurrection
   brought within the compass of his sheep, whatever troubles I meet with
   here: this is certainly a great distemper of soul, that I cannot taste
   the best, the sweetest, the most satisfying, and fullest good, more
   than present ease; but that any thing of earth would be more tasteful,
   and grateful. And this, I say, we should always take heed of; that we
   do not indulge ourselves in any thing, which is in itself of so very
   dangerous, and dreadful a consequence.

SERMON IX. [86]

   1 Thes. v. 6.

   Therefore let us not sleep, as do others--

   I CAN spend no time in giving you a view of the context, which is very
   suitable to the words now read. They are a caution against security,
   and contain in them these two things. To wit, in the first place, a
   monitory prohibition of it; "Let us not sleep." And, secondly, a
   specification of the prohibited evil; "as do others:" which words
   plainly intimate that others sleeping is no warrant to us to do so.
   Common example indeed is apt to have that pernicious influence: but we
   are taught that it cannot justify us in sleeping, that others so
   generally, and as it were industriously, compose themselves to it.
   Moreover, these words signify, that others sleeping ought the more
   effectually to warn us not to do so. Examples that carry much of terror
   in them ought to strike our hearts with dread, and to possess us with a
   cautious prudent fear, lest we fall into the same dangerous and
   desperate state. It is as if he had said; "Come, let me shew you a
   fearful sight. Take a view of the world, cast your eyes round about on
   every side; be hold the generality of men all asleep, asleep under
   wrath, care less and at ease, securely slumbering while their judgment
   lingereth not, and while their destruction doth not slumber: be warned
   by so dreadful an example not to do, as they do."

   The words do not need much of literal explication. Sleep is wont to be
   variously taken. You know what it means in the proper sense. In the
   borrowed sense it sometimes signifies, natural death; sometimes a quiet
   composure, and rest of the spirit: (( I will both lay me down in peace,
   and sleep; for the Lord only maketh me dwell in safety." Ps. iv. 8.
   cxxvii. 2. Again, that is, in a moral sense, it signifies the state of
   sin: "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead; and Christ
   shall give thee light." Eph. v. 14. It denotes especially the security
   of such a state, with reference to the wrath and judgment of God,
   whether temporal or eternal; which sleep is always sinful, and in some
   cases penal too in some degree: for we read of a pouring forth a spirit
   of slumber, and a deep sleep. Isa. xxix. 10. Rom. xi. 8. But we must
   know that the word Kathendomen, here used in the text, signifies a
   deeper or a more intense sleep. It is the word that is used by the
   Septuagint to signify the sleep of death. "Many that sleep in the dust
   of the earth shall awake." Dan. xii. 2. And they use the same word to
   express that fast sleep of the prophet Jonah, out of which all the
   storms and perils of the sea were not sufficient to awaken him. As for
   the words us, and others; the former plainly means true sincere
   christians, and the latter the rest of the world: the refuse, as the
   word loipoi emphatically signifies; or the reprobate, and worst of men.
   Two things offer themselves to us from the words, namely--that these
   others, the refuse who are the most of men do sleep: and--that God's
   own people by no means ought to do so. I shall speak to these two
   things: And,

   I. Shew you, that these others, here referred to by the apostle, do
   sleep: And,

   II. Upon what accounts it so very ill becomes the people of God to do
   so too. And then,

   III. I shall make the use of both together.

   I. I am to shew that the others, whom the text means, do sleep. And
   herein I must premise to you, before we come to evince this point, that
   by sleeping is not merely meant, that they do actually for the present
   sleep only; as if the apostle supposed them to be but in some present
   temporary slumber: but we are to understand him as speaking of them as
   habitual sleepers; or that they are under such a sort of sleeping
   disease, as is resembled by a lethargy; or a caros, which is reckoned a
   more intense degree of that disease; a veternum, or dead sleep. How
   physicians distinguish these things, or critics, I need not stay to
   tell you. But the thing that is plainly meant hereby is to represent
   this as the common state of the world, that it is an habitual
   drowsiness, such as that kind of disease serves to resemble.

   Now that this is the common state of most of the world, we may evince
   to you by such things, as are usually incident to sleep; or are
   symptoms of a sleepy, sluggish disposition. As,

   1. Forgetfulness, which has most proper reference to things past.
   Sleepy persons are very oblivious. So is the common case of the world.
   Men are forgetful of things they are most concerned to remember, and
   most forgetful of them. They have generally forgot that they are
   creatures; have forgot that with the rest of men they are lapsed, and
   revolted from their Creator, and become sinners; forgot that they
   sprung from an apostate race, and that they were children of wrath, one
   as well as another. Thus their strange forgetfulness of things, which
   one would think should continually urge them, shews that they are
   continually asleep.

   2. Insensibleness, or stupidity, which hath reference to what is
   present. Persons that are in a more intense and deep sleep, you cannot
   make them feel without difficulty. Such as are in a caros, prick them
   and they do not feel. Sleep is a binding of the senses, and such a deep
   sleep strongly binds them. So the common case is with the world. It is
   a wonder of divine power if at any time their hearts are made to feel;
   and a thing to be recorded (as you find it is in the Acts of the
   Apostle's, chap. 2. 37.) if any are ever pricked in their heart, though
   never so pungent things are spoken to them.

   3. Security; or unapprehensiveness of any future threatening danger.
   Why, so you know the case is with persons asleep. Let the danger be
   never so near, as well as dreadful; if the house be on fire, if the
   murderer be by the bed-side, if the sword be at the breast, the knife
   at the throat, yet they are void of all fear. And do not we know this
   to be the common case with the world? Destruction from the Almighty is
   no terror to them. They rush with all violence upon every danger, as a
   horse into the battle: or are like persons in their nocturnals; who, if
   not hindered, would come upon rocks, precipices, or rivers, or fall
   into dangers that would certainly destroy them. Another thing incident
   to sleep is,

   4. Misapprehension of all things past, present, or to come. For you
   know in sleep persons use to dream, and then how strangely do they
   misapprehend things? their heads are full of false images, or false
   conceptions of those things which are true. The case is so with the
   world too in their sleep. They can tell how to dis-imagine all the
   greatest realities, and turn them into shadows. God and Christ, heaven
   and hell, and the eternal judgment, which must determine them to the
   one or the other of these, are all fancies with them. But the pomp and
   grandeur of this world, which is called fancy; [87] the business and
   turmoils of it, which are all walking in a vain shew; outward
   prosperity, which is but as a dream when one awakes: these things are
   great realities, and with them these are the main things, and the most
   important. Riches and poverty, prosperity and adversity, which will be
   all thought fancies in a little while, are great things with these men;
   so aptly do they misapprehend in their dreams!

   5. There is also (which is near a-kin to the last) a great unaptness to
   reflect upon any thing as absurd, though never so truly so, which
   occurs to them in this dreaming sleepy state. It is so with persons,
   you know, in dreams. Let things occur to them never so absurd, they
   never take notice of the absurdity. Let them dream themselves to be in
   never such odd, an tic postures, all is well; they find no fault with
   any thing they do, or is done to them, while they are in their
   slumbers. And so is the case with the world too. The most absurd things
   imaginable, are no absurdities to them. To live in this world of God's
   making, while he feeds them with breath from moment to moment, yet as
   "without God in the world;" to be concerned a great deal more to please
   themselves than him, as if his favour were of no importance, and
   signified nothing; to study more the satisfaction of their flesh, than
   the saving of their souls; busying themselves all their days about mere
   trifles: these, I say, the most absurd things that ever could enter
   into any human imagination so much as to think of, are yet no
   absurdities to them. They find no fault with this; think all is well,
   though this be their continued course, which plainly shews they are
   asleep. Those things, for which persons when awake are ready to tear
   their flesh, and do abhor and loath themselves for, they indulge
   themselves even for a life's time, Baking no displeasing reflections
   upon them all their days; never at least till they awake, which shews
   what their state was before.

   6. It is especially incident to a deeper sleep to be awakened with very
   great difficulty. The difficulty of bringing them to a right mind, to
   the exercise of their understanding, and to apply themselves to do
   according as a rectified understanding would dictate, shews them to be
   very much under the power of sleep, since there is so much ado to
   awaken them. And yet nothing will serve some, who are called upon by
   the word of God from heaven, even all their time, and yet never awake;
   roused by strange thunders of providence, many times, yet awake not.

   7. Sloth fulness is manifestly ascribed to such a sleepy distemper, or
   a listlessness to business. So it is with the world too. That which is
   the proper business of men, in this world, they will not be got to it;
   they are altogether indisposed there unto. You know how Solomon
   represents the sluggard whose hands refuse to labour and indulges
   himself in sleep and slumbers. Prov. vi. 9, 10. xxi. 25. xxiv. 30-34.
   Again,

   8. They are apt to shew great displeasure, and forwardness towards
   those, who attempt to awaken them. So it is with very drowsy persons,
   who soon grow peevish and angry if you offer to awaken them. They are
   ready to quarrel even with the very light itself, if it shine in their
   faces. Thus it is with the sleepy world too. This very light itself is
   as the shadow of death, and whatsoever it is that tends to awaken them.

   9. And lastly, there is a constant proneness to fall asleep again, if
   at any time they are startled a little. Thus it is with the world. You
   may have here and there persons who are roused to bestir themselves a
   little, but presently they drop asleep again. They can hold their eyes
   open but a little while. And thus I have shewn what is the common state
   of the world, these "others;" they are generally asleep. I now come to
   shew,

   II. That it ill becomes those who are God's own children, that is, true
   sincere Christians, to sleep as do others; namely the refuse of the
   world. This will appear upon a threefold account: it holds no
   agreement, either with their principles, or with their state, or with
   their design and end.

   1, It is very unsuitable to their principles that they should sleep as
   do others; to the constituent principles of the new creature. As for
   instance,

   (I.) Light is a main ingredient principle in that holy frame of the new
   creation. New creatures are all the children of God, as God is the
   Father of lights. They are born light, of light. It is true, light
   signifies holiness; not directly and formally, but consequentially, as
   being potently influential and efficacious. It derives, or makes an
   impression upon the heart which is correspondent, and agreeable to
   itself. The apostle tells these Thessalonians, that they are the
   children of the light and of the day. 1 Thess. v. 5. It is day with
   them. It is not only day round about them (so it is wherever the gospel
   is afforded to men) but God hath made it day within; or, as the apostle
   expresses it, hath shined in our hearts. 2 Cor. iv. 6. A daystar is
   risen there; and to lie sleeping under the light of such a day, is a
   very unsuitable thing. They have light whereby to discern, both the
   mysteries of grace, and the methods of providence; and very unsuitable
   it is in both respects that they should sleep. They have light to
   discern the mysteries of grace; those strange and wonderful things
   unfolded in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which should always
   hold the soul in an admiring posture, for it is a marvellous light they
   are brought into, 1 Pet. ii. 9. or an amazing light as the word
   signifies. (thaumaston phos.) And they have light more than other men
   to discern the methods of divine providence. The Lord's voice crieth to
   the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name. Micah vi. 9. There
   is that wisdom which is of heavenly descent, wisdom from above, by
   which they know what is the nature of God, and what are the ways of
   God, which are highly conformable to his nature, in his government of
   the world. It is not likely these should be asleep, when comparing
   things together; especially when they expect God will be doing some
   strange matter on the earth: though, at some times, the appearances
   thereof are greater than at others, and things seem near even at the
   door. If they be so, they who have not internal light cannot apprehend
   it: but those who have enlightened eyes may, especially at some times,
   see that the providence of God is bringing it to pass. It is
   unreasonable then such should be asleep, who are not in darkness, lest
   the day should overtake them as a thief; as the expression is in the
   fifth chapter of this epistle and the fourth verse. And again,

   (2.) It is unsuitable to the principle of life and power in the new
   creature. They are made to live by the most agile and noble kind of
   life that is in the world, and to which sleepiness is most
   disagreeable. They are made to give themselves unto God: as those that
   are alive unto him, and gotten out of death, wherein they were sleeping
   before. They are to reckon themselves indeed dead to sin, but alive to
   God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom. vi. 11. I might also mention
   those three eminent principles of faith, love and hope, all directed to
   action; but the lime will not permit.

   2 For sincere christians to sleep as do others is very unsuitable to
   their state. As in the ninth verse of this chapter the apostle
   observes, that God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
   salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. By which he intimates, that the
   refuse part of the world have the to kens on them of persons appointed
   unto wrath; while those, who are true and sincere are appointed to
   obtain salvation* And,

   3. It is unsuitable to their designs and ends. They who have so great
   things to do, as to serve and glorify God all their time in this world,
   and to save their own immortal souls, and to gain an immortal state of
   life and glory; methinks should have no time to sleep. It would be
   altogether unsuitable to their business to allow themselves so to do.
   But I cannot insist further here, and shall pass on,

   III. To the use of this subject. And sundry things these truths taken
   together would yield us by way of inference, for our improvement. As,

   1 That God's own people, and the men of this world, are two distinct
   sorts of people. They are alii, atque alii. "Let not us sleep, as do
   others." It would be a very useful consideration to us many times to
   think seriously of this matter, that there are two sorts of people in
   the world; and then to think seriously also to which I must annumerate
   myself, or to which sort I belong.

   2. The people of God are a select and a saved people, the rest are a
   refuse people. This is plainly too held forth to us. Christians are a
   faithful, chosen generation, and possession; the others are not so, but
   are of a vile and abject sort. All indeed were naturally alike; but
   they who are taken out and selected, are made a very peculiar sort of
   people, in their habitual frame, and in respect of the permanent fixed
   excellencies that are in them, above and beyond what are to be found in
   other men.

   3. The people of God are not to imitate the rest of the world. "Let not
   us sleep as do others." They are a peculiar and a different people from
   these "others;" and therefore must do other kind of things. "What do ye
   more than others?" said our Lord to his disciples, upon a supposition,
   that they should only do so and so; or content themselves with going no
   further than the Scribes and Pharisees: but this absurdity is implied
   at the bottom, that for them to do no more than others were a most
   intolerable thing. Our Saviour there reasons ex absurdo, and supposes
   it very absurd that his disciples should do no more than others. They
   are not to be conformed to this world; not to run with others into the
   same excess of riot, though they speak never so ill of them for their
   singularity. 1 Pet. iv. 4. We may further learn,

   4. That it is not enough for the people of God to abstain from the
   positive evils of these others, but they must beware also of their
   neglects. Many think that they do fairly well, that they are not guilty
   of those gross commissions that many other men are; but do not tax
   themselves for being guilty of their neglects, carelessness,
   sleepiness, sloth and security "But alas! we are not to sleep with
   others, to be emissive with them of what is incumbent upon us to do.

   Well, that I may hasten to a close, this truth ought to be awakening to
   us all, and should put us upon rousing ourselves. What! is the world
   asleep about us? and do we profess to be of another sort from them, and
   yet sleep with them? Surely it highly becomes us to bestir ourselves,
   and to shake off this drowsy temper. If I had time I would shew in some
   particulars, how pernicious and mischievous a drowsy sluggish temper of
   spirit is to a christian. While he sleeps, corruption grows. "I went by
   (says Solomon) the field of the sluggard, and by the vineyard of the
   man void of understanding (the sleepy person is a fool and a witless
   person) and it was all grown over with thorns." Prov. xxiv. 30.
   Temptation prevails; "Watch and pray therefore, that ye enter not into
   temptation." Mat. xxvi. 41. Where there is no watching, but continual
   sleeping, temptation carrieth all before it. Grace languisheth, and
   cannot but do so hereupon. Comforts fail, we cannot so much as taste
   them; much less can we fetch them from the proper objects which would
   afford them. While we sleep providences are unobserved. A great deal of
   instruction is to be got out of them, and much duty lies upon us in
   reference to them. But while we sleep, we take no notice of what ever
   God does in the world. The breathings of the Spirit also are neglected;
   for they do not always quite awaken, though they do in a degree. It
   looks to be complied, and comported with by our stirring up ourselves
   to meet with it. The divine presence is hereupon withdrawn! Christ is
   gone! How many good times are lost when our doors are knocked at, and
   we asleep! Is it not often so? Duties stand for little! all most
   slumberingly performed! in a slight, listless, heartless manner; as we
   do every thing, when we are between sleeping and waking. Either there
   is no calling upon God, or it is to no purpose. It is a dreadful thing
   to sleep upon the knee. There must be a stirring up of ourselves to
   take hold upon God, and a watching unto prayer. With what wakeful,
   lively spirits should we attend at the Lord's table! but if we indulge
   ourselves in this sleepy distemper, so it will be even there too. Our
   eternal states are hazarded! Are we sure we have done all that is
   requisite, in order to the securing of them? If we had done ever so
   much, we should be less for sleeping. While the bridegroom tarried, all
   slumbered and slept; the wise as well as the foolish virgins; but the
   wise had their oil, and their lamps ready trimmed; but the foolish had
   not. He comes, and then the door was shut, and they were shut out. They
   were not ready, they had slept away their time. Matt. xxv. 1-13. We
   make ourselves by this means liable to the surprisal of judgments. And
   is not that terrible to our thoughts, to think of being caught asleep,
   when God comes to plead in his displeasure with the inhabitants of the
   earth? I am afraid this would be the too common case among those who
   bear the name of christians, and is so now while God's judgments are
   abroad in the world. And I wish it may not be the case of many of
   those, who go for stricter professors among us, to be so surprised as
   the old world was. But certainly it will be inexcusable in us to do so
   who have had such warnings. We do not know that the old world had from
   Noah more express warnings than we have had. It is recorded as one part
   of his encomium, that "By faith he being warned of God, moved with
   fear, prepared the ark." Heb. xi. 7. We have been warned, I do not know
   how we have been moved. But sure we are very much without excuse, if we
   are without fear and care upon such warnings as we have had. For what!
   would we expect voices from heaven? or must God send prophets among us,
   or else we will regard nothing? Needs it be proclaimed, that within so
   many days, we and our city shall be destroyed? Surely we have so much
   understanding as to compare the way of God's dispensation in former
   times, when the case has been as it is with us; and to make a
   comparison between the former, and the present case, in respect of
   wickedness and provocation! we may then see how we are to make the
   comparison, in respect of God's judgments.

   I know there are pretences for security; and things do very obviously
   suggest themselves to the thoughts of many, by which they put off or
   prevent what there is of an awakening tendency in the judgments of God.
   And perhaps it may be said: "Why, to what purpose would it be for us to
   be so wakeful, and apprehensive of such and such fearful things coming
   on? we can not prevent them by that." But that is more than you know.
   You do not know but that most serious importunate seeking of the face
   of God, jointly and separately, in congregations, and families, and
   closets; being much upon the knee, much with God in private; may
   prevent a great deal: you do not know how much it may prevent of the
   divine displeasure. But if you do not by this means prevent the common
   calamity, is it not much to save your own soul? And though you be not
   hid in the common calamity, is it not a desirable thing to die accepted
   with God?

   But if you still say, To what purpose is it? I answer, Not to that
   purpose, that we should torment ourselves with the forethought.
   Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. Matt. vi. 34. This is not
   the meaning of God in requiring us to be watchful; nor that we should
   put ourselves upon the trial or use of any undue means, for the
   securing ourselves from external calamity. It is not, I say, to that
   purpose neither. But, positively, we have a great deal to do and a
   great deal we might do if we be awake, if we be not found asleep, when
   any wasting desolating judgment comes. We may be drawing near to God.
   Is it not better that judgments take us near to God, than afar off? We
   may be entering into our chambers; we may be making our calling, and
   election sure; clearing up our title to the eternal inheritance;
   labouring to get such graces in actual exercise, as are suitable unto
   such a time, and such a state of things: to be prompt and ready to know
   how to use our faith and patience and not to be as those who know not
   how to use their hands, when the time for action cometh.

   Finally. We may be contemplating the heavenly state; recounting with
   ourselves, that it is happy for us we are sure of happiness above:
   endeavouring to frame our hearts to an indifferency, as to all
   sublunary things and enjoyments, ready to lose all and be undone. These
   are things we know not how to digest, without preparation. And to have
   these things snatched away, before our hearts are loosened from them,
   will be the way to pluck our hearts away too. But we should be
   crucified to the world, and have the world crucified to us. Then we are
   unconcerned with one another. Dead men He quietly one by another, give
   one another no more wounds. And certainly it is better to be taken in
   such a posture as this, when judgment comes, than to be found in all
   these respects altogether unprepared.

   And whereas it may he said: "But why should we so concern ourselves;
   why should not we rest in peace and quietness? We have apprehended
   danger a great many times before to be very near us, but God has kept
   it off. He is able to keep us still." And this I am most troubled at of
   all, that this should be used as a kind of religious pretence for
   security, "God is able to keep off any threatening danger."

   The doctrine is true, but grossly misapplied. Did never any storm
   befall the church of God yet? and what! was not God as able to have
   kept it off then? We should consider with ourselves. Is it, according
   to the aspects of providence, and God's ordinary methods before, likely
   that it should be kept off? How can we but think there is a day coming
   of God's reckoning with a people of such provocations as we are? What I
   are we more innocent than our neighbours, weltering in blood, and in
   great desolation, round about us? Nor do I think our danger is so much
   from incensed enemies abroad (for we hear of wars, and rumours of wars
   among our neighbours) as from the security of our own hearts. We have
   not so much reason to fear their arms, as we have a slumbering spirit
   in our own bosoms.

   But if these threatened evils be yet kept off, what are we the worse
   for being prepared? We lose no labour. It is worth our labour to lie
   prepared to live or die, for good days and bad. We have been only
   doing, what is our duty at all times. We should be always watching; for
   we know not when our Lord will come and call us. Therefore we have no
   reasonable pretence why we should indulge ourselves to sloth, and say;
   "Yet a little more sleep, and yet a little more." No, no; there has
   been a great deal too much already.

SERMON X. [88] [89]

   Daniel ix. 25.

   --The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous
   times.

   THAT we may the better discern the reference of these words, we shall
   give you a very general and brief account of the contents of the
   chapter, which consists more especially of two parts; a prayer, and an
   answer thereunto.

   We have first, the prayer made by Daniel on the behalf of ruined
   Jerusalem, and captive Judah. The occasion of which we have an account
   of, premised in the first and second verses of the chapter; to wit,
   that at such a time as is there mentioned, Daniel did understand by the
   books (that is, no doubt, by consulting the writings of Jeremiah) how
   long the desolations of Jerusalem were to continue, and that God meant
   to accomplish seventy years in those desolations. Hereupon he knew that
   the time was near expiring. There was a way opened very far, for the
   restitution and deliverance of this people. The feign of Nebuchadnezzar
   was finished; and those of Evil-merodach, and Belshazzar past; Cyrus
   had succeeded; and having taken Babylon, transferred the monarchy
   (which had continued for many years among the Assyrians [90] ) unto the
   Medes and Persians. This Cyrus is called the servant, or the anointed
   of the Lord, (Isa. xlv. 1.) by whom he meant to make way for the
   deliverance and restitution of his people; and by that Darius also, who
   is mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, and who, as some
   conceive, was at this time a viceroy under Cyrus. [91] Hereupon he
   applies himself to serious seeking of God's face; and makes that
   prayer, which you find continued unto the twentieth verse of the
   chapter. From thence, unto the end of it,

   Is secondly, The answer to this prayer by the angel Gabriel, sent while
   Daniel was yet a praying. In which he acquaints the prophet with the
   measure and compass of that time, wherein the great things were to be
   done; which he now not only immediately prayed for, but which he
   further had a commission to acquaint him with; namely, that seventy
   weeks were determined for the bringing these things to pass (manifestly
   weeks of years, as is the Scripture way of computation sometimes) all
   which amount to four hundred and ninety years. Within the first seven
   of those weeks, that is, forty-nine years, the angel gives him to
   understand, that Jerusalem should be rebuilt: namely, the street, that
   is, all the inward part, or the houses of the city; and the wall that
   should encompass it about; that after the expiration of sixty -two
   weeks, added to those seven, the Messiah should come; [92] and that in
   the last week, even in the middle of it, he should be cut off. A
   prophecy to which after wards the event did so very punctually
   correspond, that a very noted philosopher speaking of it was wont to
   say; that surely that prophecy (as it was called) must have been
   written after the things were done.

   But the words that we are to consider concern what was done within the
   first seven weeks, or forty nine years; for at the beginning of that
   time did the command go forth for the rebuilding of the temple and
   Jerusalem, as it was said it soon should. But the work was very soon
   after intermitted, as is reckoned for about three years; and then
   dispatched in the forty-six years that followed. Unto which the Jews
   have reference, more particularly speaking of the temple, "Forty and
   six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in
   three days?" John ii. 20. As it was not a total destruction which it
   suffered afterwards; so it was not a rebuilding from the ground, but a
   restoration, which it had by Herod.

   This is that which is, in short, foretold to Daniel here, in reference
   to Jerusalem: that though it would be a troublous time, in which such a
   work should be attempted and carried on; yet the work should be carried
   on, and completed notwithstanding. And therefore what the words do more
   obviously present us with and offer to our observation, is;

   That God takes care for the rebuilding of his Jerusalem, so as to
   effect it notwithstanding the troubles of the times.

   But that we may consider this matter with the more use and profit to
   ourselves, it is requisite that we understand, that Jerusalem was
   capable of being considered under a twofold notion: cither as
   spiritual, or as civil. In the former sense, by the name of Jerusalem
   is usually in Scripture signified the church of God; and we are not to
   think that this sense was unintended in this colloquy, as I may call
   it, or interlocution about Jerusalem between Daniel, and the great God
   by his angel. Neither had Daniel a reference to it in his prayer, nor
   God in his answer by the angel, only considered upon a civil account;
   that is, as it had been a great, and an opulent, and a famous city, of
   much account in the world. It was not, I say, upon this civil
   consideration, merely, that either Daniel was so concerned: or that the
   great God did seem so directly, and with so special a care and
   providence, to concern himself about it: but as it was the seat of the
   divine presence, and worship; and had been the throne of his glory,
   though he had suffered it to be disgraced to a very great degree. And
   therefore both Daniel in his prayer, and the angel in his answer, speak
   of it under the name of the holy city, as you may see in the sixteenth,
   nineteenth, and twenty-fourth verses of this chapter; in which they do,
   as it were, mutually and certatim interest one another. And so the
   thing we have to observe and consider is this;

   That the great God doth mercifully provide and take care, that the
   building of his church should go on, even in troublous times.

   It will be worth our while to consider this point a little. The people
   of God are by the apostle Paul called his building. "Ye are God's
   husbandry, ye are his building." 1 Cor. iii. 9. The conversion of souls
   is the building the church. The growth and improvement of the
   converted, is the building up or edification of particular souls. Such
   building work as this the blessed God takes care should go on; should
   not be laid aside altogether, even in times of difficulty and trouble,
   but should go on notwithstanding. For the power is greater by which God
   doth manage such work, than that by which he cart be resisted in it;
   and the mercy is greater with which he is intent upon it, than to be
   diverted from it. If he have such work to do, who shall let it? If he
   will work, who shall hinder him? And if his merciful inclination hath
   once made him intent upon it, he will never suffer any thing to divert
   it. His power, I say, is too great to be resisted; and so is his
   goodness, to be diverted from such a work.

   Yea, and he not only takes care that it should be carried on,
   notwithstanding the troubles of the time; but also that it shall be
   carried on in some measure by them, or that they shall be in some sort
   subservient thereunto. For lie so orders it, as that even by the
   troubles of the times,

   First: His under-agents, his instruments or builders whomhe employs,
   have their diligence so much the more quickened. Those that were
   employed in the building of Jerusalem, appeared so much the more eager
   and intent upon the work; by how much the more Tobias, Sanballat, and
   some others did bend and set themselves against them in it. Yea, and

   Secondly: By the means of such troubles too are particular souls, many
   times, stirred up, and made more serious and impressible; more apt to
   prize, and more ready to improve all good seasons, which tend to
   spiritual edification, as they do occur. When the word of the Lord is
   more precious, when it is enjoyed upon very uncertain terms, it ought
   to be always so; and sometimes it is so, by God's gracious disposition.
   Then it is usually most savoury! then it is most operative, and doth
   most good! And so this work of building the church of God is carried
   on, not only notwithstanding, but even in some measure by the troubles
   of the times. Some brief use we shall make of this, and so pass on.

   1. We should learn from it not to account and reckon, that in times of
   trouble and difficulty there is nothing to be done, but to sit still;
   no further endeavours to be used, for the carrying on of God's
   spiritual building. Far be it from us to think so! For our own parts we
   have reason thankfully to acknowledge, that it is somewhat a quiet time
   with us hitherto; but it is a troublous time in the world round about
   us; and too prone we are to stand at a gaze, as amazed persons wistly
   looking round about us; and having our eyes in the ends of the earth
   (as Solomon says concerning the fool) and in the mean time to neglect
   our own proper work. We mind what others are doing, in their busy
   hurries up and down in the world; and do but little consider what we
   should be doing. Our own work lies still too much neglected, as if we
   had no such thing to do as the building up ourselves in our most holy
   faith; as if we had finished our work, and had nothing more remaining,
   nothing left us to do. And,

   2. We should take heed too of mistaking our work in a time when there
   is so much of hurry and confusion in the world; and when things are so
   blundered, that it is not very easy to discern what is to be done, and
   what not; or what way is to be taken, and what not. There are many who
   are so very intent upon this or that little mean design, in reference
   to this building, that it very much disturbs those, who are serious and
   in good earnest in reference to the main of the work itself. And there
   are those, who think there can be no such building at all, unless it be
   all according to their own model; and that the building of Jerusalem is
   nothing else, but the building up of their own party; that they are all
   the church, and that none have a share and part in it but themselves.
   But the main things, which belong to the constitution of the church of
   God, must be in our eye, while we are promoting the building thereof
   according to our capacities, and in our several stations; and whatever
   tends to promote real and substantial truth and holiness, is what we
   should be most intent upon in this work. But then again,

   Jerusalem was to be considered too under a civil notion; as it was a
   great and a famous city, very much favoured by providence, and which
   flourished under the benign influence of it, through a long tract of
   time. And so we may by analogy enlarge our observation; and render the
   truth we observe applicable unto other cities and places, which are
   considerable, in some respects in the same circumstances, with
   Jerusalem. And the thing we have to observe, is,

   That a city, or place, being ruined by its own wickedness, when it is
   restored, the restitution of it is owing to the fixed purpose, and
   active providence of God, who brings it about notwithstanding
   whatsoever difficulties.

   All this we have exemplified in Jerusalem, and it is applicable to
   other places. Jerusalem you know, was reduced from the height of its
   prosperity and flourishing state, into a miserable ruin; and it
   continued in that desolate state according to the measure of time which
   God had appointed it. It was at length restored, repaired, rebuilt, and
   in a very troublous time. If you read over the books of Ezra and
   Nehemiah, which give us the history of that affair, which the prophecy
   in our text refers to, you will find it was a very troublous time; an d
   that the troubles of the time were directed in most express opposition
   to this work, the rebuilding of Jerusalem. There were those that bore
   ill will to that city, who sometimes mocked the builders of it,
   sometimes threatened them, sometimes stirred up the Persian princes
   against them, to hinder the work; representing to them that, that city
   was anciently "a rebellious city and hurtful to kings." Ezra iv. 15.
   And though by this means they sometimes prevailed to have the work
   intermitted, yet by the favour of those very princes, some or other of
   them, God orders it that it is carried on, and brought to a perfect
   issue at last. The rebuilding of Jerusalem is enacted by a law, and
   enforced by other additional laws. You have Cyrus his decree; you have
   Darius his decree; you have Artaxerxes his decree, in the seventh year,
   and again in the twentieth year of his reign; if it was the same
   person, which I dispute not. So that by decree, upon decree, is the
   carrying on of this work reinforced; and all by the favour of the
   princes of that empire, the power whereof was endeavoured to be engaged
   against it; and sometimes it was, in some degree, upon the solicitation
   of its enemies. And solemn acknowledgements hereupon are made to the
   great God, that he did put it into the heart of the king, to ordain and
   decree so and so, in reference to this affair, as you find in sacred
   history.

   Now consider, and compare the words of the text with the event, and the
   matter is plain; that it was by fixed purpose, and active providence,
   that the affair was brought to pass. The text says expressly, that "the
   street shall be built again, and the wall even in troublous times." As
   if it was said, Let not the more formidable aspects of the times
   discourage you, as to the belief of this; the thing shall be done
   notwithstanding. And it was done.

   This also affords and challenges too an application; and there are
   several things which by way of inference we may collect, and gather for
   our own use. As,

   1. We have this implied, that a place or city long favoured by God, may
   be reduced to a very ruinous condition by its own wickedness. The
   rebuilding of Jerusalem, and the prediction here that it should be
   built again as it is expressed, does suppose such a ruin. "The street
   shall be built again, and the wall." What! of Jerusalem? is there a
   mention of building that city again? This plainly implies then, that
   Jerusalem was in desolation. And so it was; and we are told plainly
   enough how it came to be so. Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and before
   them Jeremiah, in their solemn confessions and lamentations, do own the
   cause. They had sinned, they had deeply revolted, and therefore God had
   brought upon them all the evils that were written in the law of Moses.
   So they came into that desolate state. Their city was burnt with fire,
   and all reduced even into an utter ruin.

   And it is our business this day to consider a like case to this. You
   know this has been the case of your city too. The mention of the
   rebuilding of Jerusalem bespeaks it to have been ruined before. And you
   can have no occasion to consider the rebuilding of London, but it will
   lead you to consider the foregoing ruin of it. That is our direct
   business, which lies in our way to consider; but especially the causes
   of it.

   The ruin itself is first to be considered, that dreadful ruin! In
   reference to the ruin of Jerusalem we find the prophet, in the name of
   the people of God; or we find the people of God, whom he represents,
   laying it as a charge upon their own souls, to remember the misery, and
   the affliction, the wormwood and the gall, and to have their souls
   humbled within them. And what! can a dozen, or fourteen years abolish
   in us the memory of such a ruin, as that of London was? Can it be
   forgot how the lofty city was brought low; and how the more lofty
   flames triumphed over the riches, the pride, and the glory of it? The
   thing itself surely deserves, and claims to be long remembered, and
   deeply considered and thought of.

   But especially the cause of this desolation deserves to be considered:
   namely, the provoking, and the punishing cause; the wickedness of
   London, and the divine wrath which was engaged thereby against it. The
   very fury of those flames, those flames themselves were the indications
   and issues of the greater and more furious heat of lust, and the more
   intense and hot ter fervour of divine displeasure. And if it be
   considered, methinks it should even yet melt hearts to think, that
   there was wickedness more outrageous, and wrath hotter, unspeakably
   hotter, than those flames!

   And we should have no reason to think that there was a disproportion in
   the deserving, to the punishing cause; if the particulars of those
   evils I allude to were to be recounted and reflected on. But I am
   afraid we are very apt to deal by the judgments of God, as we are too
   commonly wont to do with sermons. We hear them, and they move us (it
   may be, if at all) a little only for the present; and all the
   impression of them is soon lost and vanisheth, as if we had never heard
   them at all. The judgments of God are audible sermons. They have a
   voice. The Lord's voice crieth to the city, "Hear the rod and him who
   hath appointed it!" Micah 6. 9. Divine judgments are loudly audible,
   they have a crying voice; and it is strange that the voice of such a
   cry should be forgotten! that so dreadful an event of providence should
   be but as a nine-days wonder! that though the wound be healed, the
   scars should be worn out, and no remembrance left of it; but all
   returning to their former course, as if no such thing had been done
   among us!

   But the consideration, as was said, of the thing that was done, would
   receive a great deal of weight by considering the doers; namely, God
   and ourselves. That the inhabitants of London, should be, as it were in
   a conspiracy to destroy Lon don seems very strange. And yet was not
   that the case? How full have men's minds been of severity towards such,
   as they have thought, or suspected, to have been the designing
   instruments; but how merciful in the mean time to themselves! Every one
   added something to the burning; and especially every one that allowed
   himself in the ways of such sins, as we cannot but know are very
   provoking to his jealous eyes, and which God will least of all spare
   for, when they are found among them who profess his name.

   And that it should be God's doing is never to be forgotten. That God
   should have such a controversy with a people, who had so long borne his
   name; and with a city, wherein he had so long dwelt! And yet, "shall
   there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?" Amos iii. 6.
   Are not we to acknowledge his own doing in the case? He is said to do,
   whatsoever creatures do; whatsoever second, or subordinate causes do,
   while he has them in his hand, or in his power: either to restrain, or
   let loose their inclinations and natural tendencies, as he pleaseth;
   though he do not prompt them to this, or that thing. And again,

   2. We may collect hence for our further use, that such a desolation and
   ruin, followed by such a restitution and recovery is to be looked upon,
   as an argument of the divine displeasure not prevailing so far as unto
   a total rejection; and abandoning of such a people, or such a city.
   There was great displeasure against Jerusalem, and the breaking out of
   that displeasure in to such a judgment and vengeance, as came upon it,
   was indeed very formidable, if you consider that alone. But if you
   consider the promise, that "the street and the wall shall be built
   again", and that notwithstanding the greatest difficulties that
   troublous times may lay in the way of such a work; this shews it was
   not a displeasure, to a total abandoning that city. And we for our
   parts have reason to acknowledge the divine goodness in this, and that
   mercy has been remembered in judgment: that there has not been upon the
   ruin of this city such a curse or malediction, as was that of Jericho;
   "Cursed be the man before the Lord that riseth up, and buildeth this
   city Jericho! he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born,
   and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it." Josh. vi. 26.
   We have reason, I say to bless God that he has not so cursed us. And,

   3. We may collect further, that much less is such a ruin, (when by the
   divine favour it is followed with such a restitution) to be looked upon
   as an argument against our religion; against the religion of our
   people, and our nation. Some might perhaps be too apt to make such an
   invidious interpretation and comment upon such a piece of providence;
   but the following issue of things is some refutation, a refutation good
   enough for such an argument. And it was the occasion of saint
   Augustine's writing those twenty-two books (as he himself testifies)
   concerning the city of God; that there were, in his time, such conceits
   and apprehensions, upon such a like event that happened to a famous
   city. For the Goths having invaded Rome and sacked and ruined that
   city; the pagan enemies, of that time, had an apprehension among them,
   and talked it commonly, that this ruin was fallen upon Rome, upon the
   account of its having become so much Christian, as it was at that time.
   It was the design, I say, of all those books to contend against the
   folly of such an opinion as that; at least this was the occasion of
   Augustine's writing them, and that design is carried on very much
   throughout them. And again we may note,

   4. That it argues a very favourable divine providence, when God does so
   fixedly purpose, and effectually bring it about, that a city so
   desolated should be restored and raised again, God's hand ought to be
   acknowledged in the raising, as well as in the ruin of such a city.
   Both were indeed alike strange as to our case. Before that desolating
   judgment came, in whose thoughts was it? who suspected such an event?
   As before that judgment came upon Jerusalem, that calamitous state and
   desolate judgment which befel that city, you find it said, "Who would
   have believed, that ever an enemy should have entered within the walls
   of Jerusalem?" So who would have believed that such a calamity was
   approaching as that of London's fire before it came? that all the power
   of this city should not be able to withstand the fire at first; but
   that it should diffuse, and spread so universally, so irresistibly;
   who, I say would have thought it? And who would have thought that it
   should have been so soon raised up again? and how much besides, and
   beyond expectation was it? [93] As in reference to Jerusalem, who of
   those, who beheld it in its ruins, would have thought or hoped that
   they should again with so much joy behold Zion the city of their
   solemnities, and see Jerusalem as before, a peaceable habitation? When
   God doth things not looked for, they ought to make the greater, and
   deeper impression. When he bestows unexpected mercies, he expects
   impressions of deep and lasting gratitude; such impressions as are not
   to be worn out. For what! will we refer all these things to chance? or
   to mere human industry? Is it by a casual concurrence of accidents that
   such a thing as this is brought about? With respect to a particular
   house it is said, "Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain
   that build it." Psal. cxxvii. 1. And will we disinterest God in so
   momentous a work as this is, the restitution of such a city? And again,

   5. Take both the ruin and the restoration together, and we have mighty
   incentives, and strong obligations to study more the pleasing of that
   God, and keeping of his gracious presence, who must be our keeper; the
   keeper of you, and your city. We read of a certain city in Italy, whose
   inhabitants chained the statues of their gods to their particular
   stations; upon the apprehension they had of how great concern it was to
   the weal of their city to keep their deities among them, or that they
   should not be deserted, and forsaken by them. I need not trouble you
   with the particular occasion of it, But,

   God is only to be held and kept among us by bands of his own making; by
   his own covenant and his own promises, by which he is most strongly
   held, if we do not make a violent rupture ourselves, and break off
   ourselves from him. But it is much to be feared the divine presence is
   little coveted, or desired; and it little appears that God hath a
   dwelling in many of the new built houses of this city, where men little
   concern themselves whether they have God with them or no. How many
   families are there, who, after so monitory a judgment, and after so
   obliging a mercy, yet call not upon the name of the Lord! or wherein
   that wickedness dwells, which will not permit him a dwelling there! Is
   this just dealing? that when he provides you houses, you will not
   permit him a dwelling there? He furnisheth your habitations, and you
   spoil his. We find mention made of a people, who say unto God, "Depart
   from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways:" (Job xxi. 14.)
   and yet he filled their houses with good things. Ungrateful, and
   unworthy wretches! He tills their houses with good things, and they bid
   him begone. But as it follows there, "the counsel of the wicked is far
   from me". Job xxi. 16. Let it be far from you also. That vile temper,
   that wretched disposition of heart far be it from me! Let not my soul
   enter into their secret; into the secret of those, who have the heart
   so to requite the Lord! I only add, in the

   6. And last place, that such a ruin, and consequent restitution, are no
   assurance to such a place or city that it should never be ruined again.
   Let us so far improve the instance of Jerusalem here. Upon such a
   prayer so solemn, and many a prayer besides offered up by spirits
   wrestling and deeply engaged about this business, here comes a gracious
   prediction and promise; to wit, "I will favour Jerusalem, the street
   shall be built again, and the wall, and the work shall be carried on,
   let the difficulty be never so great, and the contentions against it
   never so high and earnest." Why, one would have thought divine favour
   had been now so fixed to Jerusalem, that it should never have been off
   more. But how much otherwise was the case! Jerusalem suffered many a
   distress after this rebuilding. For after this it was harassed much by
   the Grecians, Syrians, Parthians, and the Romans; and by some of these
   several times. And last of all it was taken, and so dreadfully ruined,
   (I mean the destruction brought upon it by Titus) that ever since one
   may go (as once was said of another place) and seek Jerusalem, in
   Jerusalem, and all in vain. But God forbid that this should be the
   issue as to London! God grant that it may never be so! that the
   prevailing and growing wickedness of this city (for it seems to be
   growing) may never bring things to that pass, as that one may as vainly
   go to seek London, in London.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [88] Preached at Haberdashers' Hall, September 2, 1678.

   [89] It plainly appears, that this sermon was preached on occasion of
   the fire of the city of London, (which began September 2, 1666) and its
   restoration again to its former splendour, in a few years time. In
   order to illustrate some parts of this discourse, some account will be
   given of this affair, towards the conclusion of it, in a marginal note.

   [90] I suppose the author means the Babylonians. For the Assyrian
   Monarchy was dissolved, on the death of Sardanapalus, after it had
   stood above 1300 years, by Arbaces and Belesis. The latter of whom, who
   is also called Nabonasser, founded the Babylonish empire, which
   continued only 210 years; that is, to the time of Cyrus' taking the
   capital, who laid the foundation of the Persian Monarchy.

   [91] The opinion of those, whom the author alludes to, seems to be
   wrong. Darius, the Mede, was uncle to Cyrus, and without doubt is the
   same with Cyaxares in Xenophon; who both engaged, according to that
   author, in the war against the Babylonians. But Cyrus, who was general
   of the Persian army, commanded at the seige of Babylon; and took that
   city by a remarkable stratagem, of which Dean Prideaux gives an
   account, both from Herodotus, and the eighth book of the Cyropaedia of
   Xenophon. The city being taken, the whole Babylonian empire fell into
   the hands of Cyrus; who, as long as his uncle Darius, otherwise
   Cyaxares, lived, allowed him a joint title with himself in the empire;
   and out of deference to him, made him not merely a viceroy, but yielded
   him the first place of honour in it. Nine years are generally allotted
   by chronologers to the reign of Cyrus; the two first of which he
   reigned in conjunction with his uncle, and the seven following (Darius
   being dead) he reigned as the sovereign, and supreme head of the whole
   empire.

   [92] The Author undoubtedly means, in his public character.

   [93] For the illustration of this and some other parts of this
   discourse it may not be improper to give the reader a short account of
   what the author here alludes to; I mean, the ruin of the city of London
   by fire, and its sudden and wonderful resurrection again from its
   ashes. Of which surprising events many of our historians have given us
   a very pathetic account; though possibly some of my readers are not
   much acquainted with them, and consequently will not be able to read
   this sermon with equal pleasure and advantage. The dreadful fire, so
   often alluded to, began on September 2, 1666; near the place where the
   monument now stands; by which one of the noblest, and most magnificent
   cities in the world, was turned into ashes in a few days. A raging east
   wind we are told fomented it to an incredible degree: which in a moment
   raised the fire from the bottom to the tops of the houses, and
   scattered prodigious flakes in all places, which were mounted so vastly
   high into the air, as if heaven and earth were threatened with the same
   conflagration. The fury, as an English historian observes, soon became
   insupportable against all the arts of men and power of engines; and
   besides the dreadful scenes of flames, ruins, and desolation, there
   appeared the most killing sight under the sun, the distracted looks of
   so many citizens, the wailings of miserable women, and the cries of
   poor children, and decrepit old people with all the marks of confusion
   and despair. The inscription on the famous pillar or monument, erected
   by that celebrated architect Sir Christopher Wren, in memory of this
   calamity, tells us; The fire with incredible noise and fury destroyed
   eighty-nine churches, among which was the cathedral of St. Paul; many
   public hospitals, schools, libraries, a vast number of stately
   edifices, thirteen thousand two hundred dwelling houses, four hundred
   streets &c. The destruction was sudden; for in a short time the same
   city, which was seen in a flourishing condition, was reduced to
   nothing: and after three days when the fatal fire had in appearance
   overcome all means of resistance and human counsels: by the will of
   heaven it stopped, and was extinguished." This was a sight, as Dr.
   Calamy observes, that might have given any man a lively sense of the
   vanity of this world, and all the wealth and glory of it, and of the
   future conflagration of the world itself. [Abridgment of Baxter's life,
   vol. 1. p. 314.] I shall only add, without inquiring into the causes of
   this dreadful calamity which the author has hinted at, in one part of
   his discourse; that all persons, as Echard tells us, were indefatigable
   in the great work of rebuilding, and making provision for the
   resurrection of this city: and that Sir Jonas Moore having raised
   Fleet-street, according to the model appointed; from that beginning the
   city grew so hastily towards a general perfection, that within the
   compass of a few years it far transcended its former splendour.

SERMON XI. [94] [95]

   Psalm lxvii. 2, 3.

   That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health
   among all nations. Let the people praise thee, O
   God; let all the people praise thee.

   I TAKE it for granted, it is generally known that it is by public
   authority recommended to us, this day, to celebrate the praises of God,
   for the preservation and success, vouchsafed to his majesty's person,
   and forces abroad: and particularly, that God hath protected and
   guarded so precious a life, amidst all the dangers and deaths, that
   threatened it in the seige of Namur; and given success to the design of
   [taking that fortress.

   And whereas the proclamation by the lords-justices appointing a
   thanksgiving on this day in reference to these great things, takes
   notice: that this protection of the king's life, and the success of his
   forces in that great undertaking, is justly to be looked upon as an
   answer to prayer, especially the prayers of that day of fast, that was
   appointed and observed in the beginning of the summer, with relation to
   this year's expedition: I do accordingly, at this time, intend to
   consider the second verse of this psalm, in connexion with the third;
   as I did on that fast-day consider it, in connexion with the first.

   The words of the proclamation are to this purpose; "That whereas they
   did appoint a general fast to be kept through this kingdom, for
   imploring the blessing and protection of Almighty God in the
   preservation of his majesty's sacred person, and prosperity to his
   arms, both at land and sea, which hath been observed accordingly; and
   forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God, of his infinite goodness, in
   answer to the prayers numbly and devoutly offered up to him, to grant
   to the forces of his majesty, and his allies, so great success in the
   taking of the town and castle of Namur: they do therefore adoring the
   divine goodness, appoint this day &c."

   Now, according to the observation that is justly made here, that God
   hath made the event to correspond so far unto prayer, I have, as hath
   been already said, determined to insist upon the second verse in
   connexion with the following, which run thus; "That thy name may be
   known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations. Let the people
   praise thee, O God! let all the people praise thee." Whereas on that
   day of public fast, I considered the second verse, in connexion with
   the first; the words of which are these: "God be merciful to us, and
   bless us, and cause his face to shine upon us; that thy name may be
   known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations."

   It was with this design that such mercy was petitioned for; or that God
   would be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause his face to shine
   upon us. Which expressions, relating to a community of people, and
   their public affairs, import favourable aspects of providence upon such
   a people, and such affairs; and that such requests were made, and such
   mercy supplicated for from heaven, with this design, that God's way may
   be known upon earth, his saving health among all nations. As this was
   the end and design of prayer, so the prospect, the expectation, and
   hope hereof, is made the great inducement, as well as the spring and
   source of praise. And what we aim at or seek for, is, that all people
   may every where praise God: that all nations may be glad and sing for
   joy because he will "judge the people righteously, and govern the
   nations upon earth."

   By the way of God we are to understand, the course of his economy in
   governing the world; but especially (as the expressions connected with
   it shew ) as it refers to the salvation of men. What our translation
   reads in two words, "saving health;" is but one in the hebrew text,
   salvation. And we know that from the same word comes that name Jesus,
   given to the great and eminent Saviour; who by a known and elegant
   metonymy, is hereupon again and again in Scripture called God's
   salvation. And judicious expositors understand this to be the highest
   intendment, and ultimate meaning of these very words; that Christ, and
   God's design of saving sinners in and by him, may be more known in the
   world. And therefore, taking the foregoing supplication as I now state
   it, connected with the resolved duty of praising God, and the
   invitation of all to a general concurrence herein; and we have a
   sufficient ground for that observation, which I shall now recommend to
   you as the theme and subject of our present discourse,

   That our souls should be greatly enlarged, and highly raised in
   praising God for successes, and for favourable aspects as to our public
   affairs, from the hope, that thereby divine knowledge may more
   generally be diffused, and spread in the world. I shall, in speaking to
   this,

   I. Briefly shew you what I mean by divine knowledge.

   II. Shew you, that such means as are here intimated; to wit, the
   successes and favourable aspects of providence, with relation to the
   public affairs of such as profess the name of God, and design to serve
   his interest in the world, have a tendency to the spreading of such
   divine knowledge among men. And,

   III. I shall shew, that the hope and expectation hereof is a very
   proper, and should be the principal spring of our praises for such
   successes, and favourable aspects upon our common affairs. And so

   IV. Make application of all, as time will allow.

   1. I shall briefly shew you, what is here intended by divine knowledge.
   That is truly called such knowledge, whose object, and whose author,
   and whose nature are divine. And such I mean that to be, which I now
   speak of; and shall open to you in the terms of the text.

   1. For the object of it; namely, God's way, and his salvation. The way
   of God, as I told you, is his economy, or course of dispensations in
   governing the world. And that takes in both religion and righteousness
   together, objectively considered; the knowledge of the true religion,
   and of all that men do mutually owe to one another. And we find that
   both are in tended here in this context. That the general spreading of
   religion and righteousness is designed, and aimed at (with the desire
   and expectation of which the Psalmist's heart is so much taken up) you
   may see from the seventh verse, which concludes the psalm. "God shall
   bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him." This shall be
   the consequence of his saving us; his giving us success, or his making
   his face to shine upon us: that is, that as he blesseth us, men shall
   more and more be induced to bless him. That expression, "the fear of
   God" is, you know, a paraphrase of true religion: not only religion in
   general towards God, but even such religion as bath its foundation in
   Christ, the Saviour and Mediator between God and man. And this seems to
   be here intended in the words of the text, "That thy way may be known
   upon earth, thy saving health among all nations." There can be no such
   thing as religion in the world at all, which is not founded in the hope
   of mercy, as the spring and fountain; and of final felicity, as the
   end, that all shall result into at last. There could be no more
   religion upon earth, than in hell, if there were no hope of salvation.
   Men would but have the religion of devils, or fear God with a fear of
   horror. For the devils are said to believe there is one God, and
   tremble; (phrissousi,) that is, gnash their teeth for horror. James ii.
   19. They tremble to think there is a power superior to them, which they
   cannot overcome; and that will take a just, and eternal revenge upon
   them, for their insolent rebellion and wickedness.

   It is then the knowledge of God's salvation, that giveth a rise and
   spring to religion; and without this, there can be no such thing as
   true religion in the world. But then also, that righteousness is
   comprehended within the compass of the object of this knowledge, as
   well as religion, appears from the same context; "Let the nations be
   glad and sing for joy, for thou shall judge the people righteously, and
   govern the nations upon earth." ver. 4. As God, by the dispensation of
   the everlasting gospel, requires and teacheth us to live righteously,
   as well as godly; so doth that knowledge, which he ingenerates and
   worketh in the minds of men (wherever that teaching is efficacious)
   produce righteousness towards one another as well as religion towards
   God. Both these I take therefore to be comprehended together, in the
   object of this knowledge; and so far it is divine. And,

   2. It is divine also with respect to the author of this knowledge. The
   promise in the new covenant, which God said he would make with his
   people, and which is the connective bond of all that are his people
   indeed, is this; that they should be all taught of God. The passage is
   quoted from Jeremiah, chap. xxxi. 33, 34. by the apostle to the
   Hebrews; chap. viii. 10, 11. "For this" is the covenant that I will
   make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will
   put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will
   be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. And they shall not
   teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know
   the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the greatest." And
   indeed if that were not designed and meant, we could not give a
   reasonable account, why this should be made the matter of request and
   supplication to him, that his way might be known upon earth, his
   salvation among all nations. But though this is a knowledge to be
   taught and given by God himself, yet he useth means in order thereto.
   But by how much the more overpowering his influences are, and by how
   much the brighter and more penetrating his light is, in begetting this
   knowledge, so much the less doth the instrumentality of the means
   appear herein, and God is seen in it so much the more. And then,

   3. The nature of this knowledge, as well as the object, and the author
   of it, must be understood to be divine too; inasmuch as it is plainly
   intimated to be efficacious and transforming knowledge, so as to make
   the subject like the object; that is, so as to make men appear like so
   many representations of God himself in this world; with respect to
   their holiness towards himself and mutual love, equity, and
   righteousness one towards another. This is the meaning of his writing
   his law on their heart. For whereas his law is all gathered up (as it
   is by our Lord himself) into this double summary of loving God with all
   our hearts and souls, our minds and strength, and loving our neighbours
   as ourselves; to have this divine knowledge, in truth and reality, is
   to have it so efficaciously operative, as to transform the very soul
   into this twofold love; and so accordingly to frame this world and the
   minds of men every where into compositions of love towards God, as the
   supreme good, and towards one another, in obedience and subordination
   to him. And this is that divine knowledge, which the text and context
   do manifestly intend. But,

   II. We are to shew you how successes, and the favourable aspects of
   providence, relating to the public affairs of those who profess his
   name and espouse his interest, tend to propagate such knowledge as this
   in the world: that is, according to the expression in the text, to make
   it universal, so as that God's way may be known in all the earth, and
   his salvation unto all nations; and that true religion, and the fear of
   God may take place unto the utmost ends of the earth, according to the
   conclusion of the psalm. Arid when we behold God in such favourable
   aspects and appearances, how much does the hope revive, and rise in our
   souls, that this shall be the final issue of things! namely, that God
   shall be thus known in all the earth so as to be every where
   worshipped, and subdue the nations of the world to his equal, mild and
   merciful government. I shall proceed here by these two steps.--I shall
   take notice to you, that we have a great deal of reason to hope for
   this end: and--that we may observe an aptitude in such means to
   subserve it.

   1. We have a great deal of reason to hope for this end; as a thing,
   which God ultimately has in design, and will effect. We find several
   unaccomplished, prophetical scriptures of this import, as that "The
   earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover
   the seas." Isai. xi. 9. And so operative will be this knowledge, that
   besides the impressions of religion which it shall make upon the souls
   of men Godward it shall also impress a universal peaceableness, and
   righteousness upon men's minds, towards one another; so as that men
   shall generally agree to "beat their swords into plough-shares, and
   their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against
   nation, neither shall they learn war any more." Isai. ii. 4. Such will
   be the powerful efficacy of this divine knowledge, that it shall
   transform the world into love and kindness, benignity, and goodness; as
   God himself is love, and the supreme, and all-comprehending goodness.

   And we see also a passage in the prophecy of Isaiah, which hath a more
   particular reference unto Christ: "Behold my servant whom I uphold;
   mine elect in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him,
   he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor
   lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed
   shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench; he shall
   bring forth judgment unto truth" (unto victory it is read in the New
   Testament. Math. xii. 20.) "He shall not fail, nor be discouraged, till
   he have set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his
   law." Isai. xlii. 1-5. How far we are concerned in that, I shall not
   insist to shew; though many have made their observation upon that
   expression of the isles waiting for his law, and applied it to these
   islands that lie so near to one another, and wherein we are so much
   concerned. This however was a thing to be gradually done, but withal it
   was to be certainly and surely done; namely, that judgment should at
   length be set by him in the earth. This expression plainly imports the
   universality of the effect, and not as if it were this or that single
   spot, to which such an effect was to be confined; though, in
   strictness" of speech, if it were any where known in the world it would
   be known or set in the earth. But that cannot be the design of the
   expression as it is generally explained; but that the earth in general
   is to be the subject of this great effect: and the expressions, though
   they are wont to be applied to the case of particular souls, yet they
   have a more diffusive applicableness, which is not to be overlooked. "A
   bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not
   quench." A meiosis is acknowledged in these words: the meaning of which
   is, that he shall be so far from bruising the reed, that he shall
   strengthen it; he shall be so far from quenching, that he shall more
   and more inflame the smoking flax. This, I say, besides its being
   particularly applicable to the case of individual persons, must be
   understood also to have a general reference to the state of the
   Christian interest. That though it be low and languishing and many
   times like a bruised reed, or a little smoking flax, where the fire is
   ready to expire and go out, yet it shall not be. That bruised reed
   shall grow stronger, and that smoking flax shall be blown up into a
   flame; and so will go further and further on, till the effect shall
   measure with the earth and have no other confines and limits than that;
   till he shall set judgment in the earth, and have wrought that general
   transformation in the world, that all eyes shall see the salvation of
   God.

   And when we are told in the book of Daniel (chap. ii. 45.) of the stone
   cut out of the mountain without hands, that should become a mountain
   and fill the earth; I think there is nothing, in any time or age
   hitherto past, that can answer the import of such a saying as that is.
   This is a work yet to be done, and therefore yet in great part to be
   hoped for; that, that stone Christ, Christianity, his religion
   diffused, and spread among all nations of the earth, by an almighty
   Spirit poured forth upon all, shall be so great a mountain, as to
   measure with the world, and to fill all the earth. But I know nothing
   as yet done, that answers the import of so great a word of prophecy, as
   this is.

   Moreover we are told that upon the sounding of the seventh trumpet
   (which most agree hath not been sounded yet) all the kingdoms of this
   world are to be the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ. Rev. xi.
   15. And this will be in answer to what was predicted long before, in
   the second psalm. "Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for
   thine inheritance, and the utter most parts of the earth for thy
   possession." Psa. ii. 8. So that as to the end we have a great deal of
   reason to hope for it, which I proposed to represent to you in the
   first place.

   2. We may also discern an aptitude in such means, as we speak of, to
   serve this end: that is, when there are favourable aspects of
   providence upon those that espouse the interest of God in the world; in
   opposition to the irreligion, the anti-christianity, and the
   unrighteousness, that obtain therein, and too generally take place. By
   the consideration of several things that concur, you may discern a
   happiness in such means to serve this end. As consider,

   (1.) That the minds of men do naturally sink into atheism, or
   irreligion and a deep oblivion of God, when things run on in one course
   and tenor, with a still, uninterrupted stream. No thing is plainer or
   more obvious. Because from the creation of the world to this day, the
   course of nature hath been so constant, steady and uniform; therefore
   men have been apt to say, "Where is the promise of his coming?" 2 Pet.
   3, 4. And so when the series of providence is generally equal to
   itself, or because men have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
   Psal. lv. 19.

   (2.) God hath himself declared, that in such a case as this, he will be
   known by the judgments which he executes. Psal. ix. 16. And when they
   are judgments of such a kind, as to ensnare men in the works of their
   own hands (to use the following words) and when men's violent doings
   are turned upon their own pates, the Lord is then known by the
   judgments which he executes. "I know not the Lord, (said Pharaoh, Exod.
   v. 2.) neither will I obey his voice;" but by judgment upon judgment,
   and plague upon plague, he made him know him before he had done with
   him. He could at length say, "The Lord fighteth for Israel, against the
   Egyptians." Exod. xiv. 25.

   (3.) Men are the more confirmed in their atheism, or in undue thoughts
   of God (which comes upon the matter all to one) when the course of
   providence seems to favour unrighteousness, or to run counter to a
   righteous cause. Then it is that they say, "God hath forsaken the
   earth; and if there be any God at all, he is surely a God that taketh
   pleasure hi wickedness; he liketh our violence, our injurious, and
   wrongful dealing to mankind; and even to them, who call themselves
   after his name." Thus because judgment, upon men's works of that kind,
   is not speedily executed, therefore are the hearts of the sons of men
   fully set in them to do evil. Eccles. viii. 11. For they say, "Tush!
   God seeth not, neither is there any knowledge in the Most High;" as
   such men are brought in, speaking in the tenth, and ninety-fourth
   psalms: that is, this is represented as the sense of their hearts,
   which to him, who reads the sense, immediately impressed upon the mind,
   is equal to speaking; for he doth not need that they should put it into
   words. God reads it as it lieth there. But then,

   (4.) When the course and tenour of providence in these respects alter,
   it tends both to revive, and rectify the notions of God, in the minds
   of men; I mean, when it alters so as to animadvert upon manifest, and
   palpable unrighteousness and iniquity in the world, and to favour a
   righteous cause.

   This, I say, tends to revive the notions of God in the minds of men;
   for every body, in his distress, is apt to think of God. There are
   certain semina, certain principles of natural religion in the minds of
   all; which, though some take a great deal of pains quite to eradicate,
   yet they can never quite do it: nature is too hard for them: but those
   principles that they cannot extinguish, they make a shift to lay
   asleep. Lust is too strong for light. A propension to, and a resolution
   of being wicked, are for the most part victorious, generally governing
   in the minds of men; so as that the truths they hold, they hold in
   unrighteousness. Rom. i. 18. But affliction, and the cross rencounters
   of providence, revive the sleeping principles of religion; which are
   bound up in a torpid, and stupifying state. Men begin to bethink
   themselves, when they find themselves in perplexity and distress. And
   when the wise man in Ecclesiastes (chap. vii. 14.) bids us in the day
   of adversity to consider, he speaks according to the natural tendency
   of the thing; be cause there will be a greater aptitude in the minds of
   men to consider, when things are adverse to them, and run quite
   contrary to their inclination. And,

   The notion of a God is not only hereby revived, but in some measure
   rectified too. They, who before thought God did countenance their way,
   now find, that this was a weak, infirm argument, and that it proves no
   such thing. They cannot now any further satisfy themselves that, that
   Deity (which they cannot altogether disimagine) is favourable to
   unrighteousness; but that if there be a God, he is such a one, to whom
   right and wrong are not indifferent things. They begin, I say, to
   apprehend so now.

   An ungodly frame and disposition of spirit had obtained, to a very
   great degree, among Joseph's brethren; but when they meet with a series
   of cross providences, these remind them of their unrighteous dealing
   with their brother: the thoughts of which had slept with them long, but
   now they revive; and they now begin to return to a right mind
   concerning that very matter. But what comes nearer our case is that
   Assyrian tyrant, [96] who had been so long the plague and pest of the
   world, and wrought such a destruction among the people of God. When
   providence came to animadvert upon him, and he lay under God's rebukes
   and frowns, he fancied himself a beast; and became like one, by the
   power of his own imagination, (as that is most likely to be understood)
   till he was capable of understanding, that the Most High did rule in
   the kingdoms of men, and give and dispose of them as he thought fit,
   Dan. iv. 17 And as I noted to you before, Pharaoh would not know God,
   neither obey his voice to let Israel go, after a series of cross
   providences following one another; till at length he saw himself
   surrounded with waters, that gave a safe passage to the Israelites, but
   a continual threatening and terror to him and his army; but when he
   found their chariot-wheels taken off, he cried out: "Now we must all
   fly, God is fighting for the Israelites." Then he bethought himself of
   a God, who did not like such a course as his was of oppression and
   tyranny, over a people more righteous than himself.

   Not that we are to think, that successes and favourable aspects of
   providence are themselves, and considered apart, a measure of right and
   wrong, in the world. That can by no means agree with what we have
   supposed already; There are the greatest variations of providence
   imaginable, but there cannot be variations of what is right and wrong:
   for what is right, always will be right; and what is wrong, will always
   be wrong. But supposing that a cause be in itself manifestly righteous
   on the one hand, and unrighteous on the other; (which maybe known by
   other measures) then providence falling in with that which in itself is
   apparently right revives and strengthens the apprehension of such a
   Deity, as approves of that which is right and equal, and disapproves
   the contrary. And so it tends at once, as I proposed to shew, both to
   revive, and rectify the thoughts of God. And here upon,

   (5,) The great commotions of nations, when the world hath been long
   before in a deep dream, and a drowsy sleep, taking no notice of God
   that rules the world, and governs the kingdoms of men: when, I say,
   there are great agitations; collusions of interests, and concussions of
   nations; nation dashing against nation; if in this case an apparently
   righteous cause receives countenance, and is under favourable aspects
   from heaven, God comes to be a great deal more thought of in the world
   than he was. He is then also thought to be such, as indeed he is; a God
   who takes not pleasure in wickedness, nor approves of unjust, or
   unrighteous practices, though he may have forborne, and spared those
   for a time that used them. But further, when hereupon the thoughts of
   God are revived, and rectified in any measure in the minds of men, they
   become so much the more susceptible of superadded revelation from him;
   such as that, which is contained in the Scripture. For it is to no
   purpose, when the world is generally atheistical, and have either
   buried the notion of a God, or perverted it, so as that to think there
   is a God or that there is none, is all one with them; it is, I say, to
   little or no purpose for men to go up and down among such persons, in
   such a state of things, with a Bible; for they disbelieve such a kind
   of Deity, as that book reveals. But if the thoughts of God be
   recovered, and rectified in the minds of men, they are a great deal
   more susceptible of superadded revelation from heaven. And especially,

   (6.) If that revelation be, as that of the gospel is, a revelation of
   grace. For when God hath discovered himself by terrible things; being
   displeased with the wickedness, the atheism, the irreligion, the
   unrighteousness of men in this world: if then there be a discovery of
   his reconcileableness, of his willingness, or readiness to beat peace
   with the world; in what a preparation may the minds of men be supposed
   to be to receive such a doctrine, as that of the Christian religion? a
   discovery of God in Christ reconciling the world to himself. Do but
   observe, therefore, that method of representing the great Christian
   doctrine of the gospel, of free justification by faith in Jesus Christ,
   which the apostle takes in the epistle to the Romans. He begins it with
   the discovery of the general wickedness of the Gentile world, and
   afterwards of the Jews. As to the former he saith, The wrath of God is
   revealed from heaven against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of
   men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Rom. i. 18. And what is all
   this for? It is all to prepare and make way for the revelation of
   grace. We have proved, saith he, both Jew and Gentile to be under sin;
   and therefore that there can be no such thing as reconciliation to God,
   and acceptance with him, but it must be by the intervening
   righteousness of another. And so nothing, in the way of means, doth so
   dispose the minds of men to receive the gospel, as when God, in the
   methods and course of his providence, doth appear terrible against
   wickedness, the impiety and the injustice of men: nothing, I say, in
   point of means can be a greater preparation for the diffusion of the
   grace and light of the gospel, and the more ready and successful spread
   thereof. And I add,

   (7.) That by such favourable aspects of providence upon them that
   espouse God's interest in the world, the great obstructors of the
   progress of the gospel come to be debilitated, and that power of theirs
   weakened, and retrenched; by which they opposed to the utmost the
   diffusing of religion, and the spreading of the knowledge of God;
   making it their business as much as possible to extirpate that
   religion, which godly souls do so much desire to see spread in the
   earth. When the providence of God doth animadvert on such, as make it
   their business to destroy true religion out of the earth; so as that
   instead of its being known in all nations it shall not be known any
   longer in their own, as far as it is in their power to extirminate it:
   [97] when such, I say, are animadverted upon, every eye seeth how this
   tends to prepare, and make way for, the freer diffusion of the
   gospel-light, and knowledge, among men. For they that would do such a
   thing as root out true religion out of their own nation, to be sure
   would be far from letting it spread in the rest of the world; and, if
   it were in their own power, there should be no such thing in the world
   at all. Thus it appears that favourable events to those, who espouse
   God's interest, tend to remove obstacles out of the way to the
   diffusion of true religion; and to promote the propagation of it, in
   the earth. I therefore come now to shew, in the

   III. Place, That the hope of this issue and end should animate mightily
   our praises, and be the principal ground of thanksgiving unto God for
   such successes and favourable aspects of providence upon them, who
   espouse his interest in the world. This might be many ways made out,
   and indeed by such means as are most evident in reason, and most
   intimate to the very essence of religion. For in plain common reason it
   appears, that the creature is not to be his own end; much less are we
   to suppose, that God doth such and such things for the creature as his
   end. He that is the first, must be the last in all things. He that is
   the author of all things must be the end of all things. All this is
   plain to common reason. And if you go into the deeper inwards of
   religion, which are nearly allied to genuine, and rectified reason,
   nothing is plainer, than that this is grounded in those great things of
   religion, which are most essential to it. Self-denial, for instance: I
   do not pray to, nor praise God upon my own account, so much as upon
   his. For if I be a christian, if I be a disciple of Christ, I am taught
   to abandon myself, to nullify myself, and all interests and designs of
   mine, further than as they fall in with his, and are subservient
   thereunto. It is that which best agreeth with that great essential
   principle of all religion, the love of God, which is the noblest of
   all. By how much the more I love God, by so much the more is my heart
   raised in praises, when I find events to happen that have any tendency
   to promote his glory; and to make him more known, feared, loved, and
   honoured in the world. And, to speak summarily unto this matter, do but
   consider these two things; which we may superadd to all the rest.

   1. That we ought to praise God for mercies, for the same reason that we
   pray for them. But we are not to pray for them ultimately for
   ourselves, but for God; that they may serve the interest of his glory,
   and be the means of diffusing the knowledge of him in the earth. It is
   not a real glory that can be wrought out for him; but it is
   manifestative glory; which stands in his being known and acknowledged
   by his creatures, the works of his hands, and so much the more by how
   much the more general it is. I have said we are to give thanks for
   mercies, upon the same terms that we are to pray for them. And how we
   are to do that, we are taught by that method of prayer which our Lord
   himself directed; in which the first thing petitioned for, is,
   "Hallowed be thy name." Math. vi. 9. And that God may be glorified, is
   the thing which is to be first in our eye and design. It ought to be so
   in our seeking mercies from him; and consequently it ought to be so in
   our rendering acknowledgements and praises to him, for his kindness and
   mercies. And again,

   2. We ought to praise God for mercies, for the same reason for which we
   are to apprehend he bestoweth them. But it is plain he bestoweth them
   not for our sakes, but his own, "Not for your sakes do I this, saith
   the Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your
   own ways, O house of Israel." Ezek. xxxvi. 32. "I do not do these
   things on your account, but for my own name's sake: that my name may be
   known among the heathen, and that the world may more generally
   acknowledge me to be God."

   And according as things have this tendency and design, so let our
   praises be directed, this day, upon the same inducement, and from this
   same spring; namely, the hope that God's ways shall be known upon
   earth, and his salvation unto all nations: and that the present
   favourable aspects of providence will some way contribute hereunto, as
   they have this tendency and design. If we do not consider the matter
   so, we disparage our own victories, when we should give thanks for
   them; we make them little and inconsiderable, and upon the whole matter
   to have nothing in them. For abstracted from the subserviency in such
   providences to the interest of God, and religion, and righteousness in
   the world, I pray what have they in them? All goeth for nothing, and
   will be as nothing in a few years. We cannot say, that any thing is
   truly and rationally valuable, that runs not into eternity; that hath
   not a look towards an everlasting state of things, and the interest of
   that kingdom that shall never end. When the world passeth away, and all
   the lusts thereof, they who do the will of God abide for ever. 1 John
   ii. 17. It signifieth very little to particular persons whether they be
   rich, or poor, for a few days, here in this world. And it signifieth as
   little to nations, whether their condition be opulent or indigent;
   whether they be under oppression, or in a state of liberty: it
   signifieth little, I say, when it is considered, that these are
   replenished with inhabitants made for eternity, and an everlasting
   state of things, and who must shortly pass into that eternal state.
   Nothing is really, or upon rational accounts valuable with them, but
   what carries with it a signification of good, in reference to eternity.
   So it is to a person, so it is to a nation, and so it is to this world
   and all the inhabitants of the earth.

   Therefore, while we praise God for the favourable aspects of his
   providence, which have such a tendency as this, generally and
   indefinitely considered, let us bring down this to the particular case
   before us. If we apprehend much is not done to ward this great end, by
   this particular instance of a favourable providence, yet consider this
   as a part, and as a step to more. And in order to excite our praises
   the more, to heighten them, and raise our spirits in this duty of
   praising God, let us, I pray, represent to ourselves the contrary state
   of the case, even as to this particular thing that we praise God for;
   namely, his preserving the life of our king. What, if we had been to
   mourn for the loss of him! A strong hold hath also been taken, which a
   potent army came to relieve, Suppose the armies had fought; suppose the
   army that came to the relief of Namur had been victorious; and suppose
   there had been a total destruction of our own: think what the dreadful
   consequences would have been! when, instead of having the knowledge of
   God to spread further in the world, we should have had violence, and
   tyranny in the height thereof deluging Europe! and threatening a deluge
   as general, as such power could extend unto! What hope could we have
   left to our posterity, that they should long enjoy that gospel, which
   we enjoy; or profess that religion in peace which we profess in peace
   and tranquillity? I say, do but turn the tables; and consider what our
   case had been, if it were stated in a direct contrariety to what it is.
   There are many more things which I might have said,

   IV. By way of particular use of this subject; but at present let us
   call upon God for a blessing upon what hath been now spoken.

   [94] Preached September 8, 1695.

   [95] This sermon, it appears, was preached on September 8, 1695; being
   the day appointed by public authority for a general thanksgiving,
   particularly for taking the strong town, and citadel of Namur, in
   Flanders, by king William: which place as bishop Burnet tells us, was
   so happily situated, so well fortified, and so well furnished and
   commanded, that it made the attempt seem bold and doubtful. Namur had
   been taken by the French about three years before, in the view of a
   great army; which was looked upon as one of the greatest actions of
   that long reign. But though the fortifications, both in strength, and
   in the extent of the outworks, were double to what they had been, when
   the French took the place; yet king William, after a short seige,
   retook that important town and fortress, in the view of a hundred
   thousand French, commanded by the famous Mareschal Villeroy: which, as
   the forementioned historian says, was reckoned one of the greatest
   actions of the king's life; and indeed, one of the greatest in the
   whole history of war.

   the edict of Nantz a few years before, and the terrible persecution of

SERMON XII. [98]

   Joshua xxiv. 20.

   If ye forsake the Lard, and serve strange gods, then he
   will turn and do you hurt; and consume you,
   after that he hath done you good.

   SOME few things I shall offer to your notice, by way of introduction to
   what I intend from this portion of Scripture. As, in the first place,

   That the good which God had done this people, he was confessedly the
   Author of it. He not only was really, and indeed so; but he was owned,
   and acknowledged to be so. There was not a doubt in the case. It was a
   thing taken for granted, and which every one would own; that all the
   good which had been done to them, proceeded only from him, who is the
   Author of all good. And again,

   That the good which he did for this people was very peculiar, such as
   he had then done for no people beside. He gave his testimonies unto
   Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel: he had not done so
   to any people. Ps. cxlvii. 19, 20. Moreover,

   That the peculiarity of his favourable dispensation towards them was
   resolvable only into good pleasure. No other account could be given of
   it, why he should be so particularly favourable to that people above
   other people, than, as our Lord says in another case, "Even so Father,
   for so it seemed good in thy sight." Mat. xi. 26. And lastly,

   That though the destruction threatened unto one people, so and so
   offending against goodness and mercy, doth not import the certainty of
   such an event, in reference to another people, offending in the like
   manner; yet it imports the case of such a people to be very insecure,
   and that they are liable to the same destructive severities and
   consuming judgments, as if they had been the people immediately and
   directly threatened. I say they are liable, and cannot reckon
   themselves entitled to an immunity from such destructive judgments.

   These things being premised, the ground of our present discourse will
   lie thus: That the good which God hath, of mere good pleasure, and in a
   peculiar distinguishing way, done for a nation; leaveth them liable to
   consuming judgments, if they grossly offend God, and generally revolt
   from him. In speaking to this, I shall,

   I. Give you the state of this truth, generally, and indefinitely
   considered. And then,

   II. Speak unto it with special application to our own case, and the
   state of things among ourselves.

   I. I shall give you the state of this truth, as considered more
   indefinitely. And therein,--shall consider that good, which God may be
   supposed to do a people; of his own good, pleasure, and in a peculiar
   way: and--their liableness unto his consuming wrath, upon the
   supposition here put; that is, if they should grossly offend, and
   generally revolt from God, or rebel against him.

   1. Let us consider the good, which God may be supposed to do such, or
   such a people, out of mere good pleasure. And here we shall consider,
   in what respects he may be supposed to do a nation good, and also upon
   what accounts.

   (1.) In what respects. And for this we shall take our mea sure from
   what we find, even in this very chapter, in reference to the people of
   Israel. The chapter you see, begins with a large narrative and
   rehearsal of what God hath done for them; and it is well worth your
   notice, and observation. You must consider, that the time of Joshua's
   leaving them was now at hand. He was apprehensive of it, and therefore
   gathers the princes, and heads of the tribes to him on purpose to take
   a solemn leave. They had been under his conduct by divine appointment;
   and, as their general, he had led them into that good land, which God,
   by promise and oath to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, had
   entitled them to as their seed, and now conferred upon them. He was
   apprehensive of the state of their case, after his departure; knowing
   well the terms, upon which God had put himself under such bonds and
   obligations to them. Therefore he gathers the tribes of Israel to
   Shechem, and called for their elders, their judges and officers, who
   presented themselves before God. Upon which he begins his narrative of
   what God had done for them; and in what particular respects he had
   favoured them, and done them good. "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel,
   your fathers dwelt on the other side the flood in old time, even Terah
   the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor, and they served other
   gods. And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,
   and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed
   and gave him Isaac."

   Joshua here begins with that, which was the most observable thing, and
   was first in the divine eye and intention; namely, his making this
   people a plantation of religion, when the world was generally over-run
   with idolatry and wickedness. He puts them in mind how God did select,
   and sever the head of this people, from the rest of the idolatrous
   world. As elsewhere the history acquaints us with his calling him out
   of his idolatrous family, saying: "Get thee out of thy country, and
   from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will
   shew thee." Gen. xii. 1. And we are told, that "By faith Abraham, when
   he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for
   an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went."
   Heb. xi. 8. This is the fit posture of a devoted soul, and so inwardly
   had God touched his spirit that he should upon his call readily answer
   him, and not dispute the matter, nor say, "Lord, must I go I know not
   whither? and into that state, and in that way I know not?" No, faith
   formed his spirit, not for disputation, but obedience. He obeyed, and
   went. "Here am I, thy ready prepared instrument; do with me what thou
   wilt." And that which God designed to do, was to make him the head of a
   religious people; among whom he would be known, when so gross and
   general darkness had spread itself over the rest of the world. This was
   the main and principal thing in God's design; and with this Joshua
   begins this narrative: and then continues it in shewing in what ways,
   and by what gradations, God pursued the design which he had so
   graciously laid in favour of this people; out of whose line the
   promised seed was to arise, in which, at length all the nations of the
   earth were to be blessed.

   But in the mean time, the more special notices of God were to be
   confined much within the limits of this people, or them that should be
   proselyted unto them. "In Judah was God known, and his name was great
   in Israel." Psal. lxxvi. 1. And whereas this was finally a design of
   grace, the rest of the narrative sheweth, how providence did work in
   subserviency to that design; to multiply this people, to keep them
   entire, and unmingled with other nations: till that seed should spring
   out of them, in, the appointed season, in and by which there was to be
   so universal a diffusion of blessings through all nations.

   Therefore, the workings of providence are recounted after wards, in
   subserviency to this design of grace, till he conies to shew how by a
   succession of wonderful works, in a continued series, God had conducted
   them from Egypt (where they were oppressed, and multiplied at once)
   through a wilderness, where they were under his more immediate care:
   till at last, according to promise, they were planted in Canaan; the
   type of that heaven, into which the antitypical Joshua, our blessed
   Jesus was to introduce all that should be adjoined to him as the great
   Captain and Prince of their salvation.

   (2.) As we have seen in what respects, God did thus do good to his
   people; so we may also see upon what account. And this matter is
   capable of being resolved into nothing else, but the divine good
   pleasure. It was upon such terms, that this people were formed at
   first. The Lord did not set his love upon you, (said Moses) because ye
   were more in number than any other people; for ye were the fewest of
   all people: but because the Lord loved you. Deut. vii. 7, 8. And why
   did he love them? why did he so peculiarly favour them? The matter
   resolves itself; he sets his love upon you, because he loved you.
   Divine love, which is the original love of him who is the Fountain of
   goodness is its own reason; for there can be nothing former to, or
   higher than the first. And the same thing Samuel takes notice of after
   they were become a formed people. The Lord will not forsake his people,
   for his great name's sake; because it hath pleased the Lord to make you
   his people. 1 Sam. xii. 22. How came you to be made his people? Nothing
   can it be referred to, but that he was so pleased whose people you are.
   And that he makes the ground why he would never forsake them, in
   respect of their external constitution, otherwise than upon such terms
   as he himself did express before, even when he took them to be his
   people. Of which more hereafter.

   And when their state was to be restored, after its being lost in great
   measure through their defection and revolts from him, it is still upon
   the same terms. He would indeed gather them again, re-collect them out
   of the several nations into which for their defection they had been
   scattered. But why? Thus saith the Lord God, I do not this for your
   sakes, O house of Israel; but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have
   profaned among the heathen whither ye went. Ezek. xxxvi. 22. So that
   still the matter is resolved into divine pleasure and goodness itself,
   the prime import of his name, as he himself proclaimed it to Moses; The
   Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant
   in goodness and truth. Exod. xxxiv. 6. And so much concerning the good,
   which God may be supposed to do for such a people indefinitely
   considered.

   2. We are next to consider the liableness of such a people,
   notwithstanding, to more severe, and terrible, and even consuming
   judgments in case of their general revolt from him, and rebellion
   against him. This we see plainly exemplified, in the course of God's
   dispensation towards this people. And we are here to consider, that
   whatever good he did for this people, it was but according to free
   promise; and that such promise was made, with a reserved liberty to
   make use of his own right to vindicate himself, when, by injurious
   wickedness, the design of all that goodness is frustrated, and
   perverted, as much as in them lies.

   (1.) It is plain, that whatever good he did for this people, was
   according to free promise. But that is more than can be said of other
   people. They had such promised peculiar favours, as no other people
   ever had. That is, they had that good and rich country, which they
   possessed, given them by immediate grant from heaven, which no people
   under heaven ever had the like besides; and a promise ratified and
   sealed by solemn oath, over and over, unto their forefathers, Abraham,
   Isaac, and Jacob, whose God he declared himself to be, and the God of
   their seed; by which he obliged himself to do them good in this
   respect, by planting them, as a distinct people, in a rich country;
   where they should have all the accommodations that were needful for
   answering the ends, for which he would have such a peculiar people in
   this world. And though what he did for them was thus according to
   promise, yet

   (2.) In the very tenour of that promise he reserved to himself the
   liberty of animadverting upon their wickedness; and of making a way (as
   he sometimes expressed! himself) for his wrath to break in upon them,
   till at length it came upon them to the uttermost. 1 Thes. ii. 16. So
   that when any such destructive judgments should befall them, they could
   not pretend to be surprised; it was nothing but what they might expect
   and look for, even by the express tenour of that very grant, by which
   they held what they did before enjoy. And thus they were fore told it
   should be, as you may see if you look into the course of God's treating
   and stipulating with them. "It shall come to pass, if you shall hearken
   diligently unto my commandments, which I command you this day, to love
   the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
   your soul; that I will give you the rain of your land in his due
   season," &c. Deut. xi. 13. All suitable blessings are, upon that
   supposition, promised to them. But it follows; "Take heed to yourselves
   that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other
   gods, and worship them: and then the Lord's wrath be kindled against
   you, and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain, and that the land
   yield not her fruit, and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land
   which the Lord giveth you." Deut. xi. 16, 17.

   Now according to the tenour of this word of his, which you may meet
   with in multitudes of other places, was the course of his actual
   dispensations towards them. For see how things were, between God and
   them, after Joshua's decease. He had seen them planted, and settled in
   that good land. And we are told that "when Joshua had let the people
   go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to
   possess the land: And the people of Israel served the Lord all the days
   of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua; who had
   seen all the great works of the Lord that he did for Israel." Judg. ii.
   6, 7 But now, Joshua being dead, we find soon after, that "Israel did
   evil in the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim. And they forsook the
   Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt,
   and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round
   about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord to
   anger. And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he
   delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he
   sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they
   could not any longer stand before their enemies. Whithersoever they
   went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil as the Lord
   had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto them; and they were greatly
   distressed." Judg. ii. 11-16. And afterwards, in the residue of this
   second chapter of Judges, is the summary given us of their deportment
   towards God; and of God's procedure towards them, under all the several
   succeeding judges, that governed them, till the time they had a king
   set over them by their own choice. Whereas before, their government was
   designed to have been an immediate Theocracy; that is, they were to
   have lived in all points, under the immediate direction of God himself.
   But they affected to be like their neighbours, both in civil and
   religious respects and so God, having, in his first grant of special
   favour to them, reserved a power of doing himself right upon them,
   managed the course of his dispensation towards them accordingly.

   And this we may take for an account of the state of this case, more
   indefinitely considered; forming our idea from what we find exemplified
   in this people. Great things were in a peculiar way of favour done for
   them; yet we find all this did not exempt them from the terrible
   severities of vindictive justice upon their revolts from God, and
   rebellions against him. I come now,

   II. To consider all this with application to our own case, and the
   state of our affairs; in which application, two things must be
   considered.

   1. A commemoration, with great thankfulness and gratitude, of the good,
   which God hath done for our nation; in a continued series, and course
   of dispensations, through a long tract of time. And,

   2. A representation, notwithstanding, how vain an imagination it would
   be that we are thereby exempt from a liableness to vindictive and
   consuming judgments, in case of a gross and general revolt from God,
   and rebellion against him. Of these two parts this application shall
   consist.

   1. We are to make a thankful commemoration of the great good, which God
   hath done for our nation even in a long continued course; as he did for
   that people, who have given us the ground of our present instruction.
   And here we are concerned to say as we find the prophet speaking: "I
   will mention the loving-kindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the
   Lord, according to all that the Lord hath bestowed on us; and the great
   goodness towards the house of Israel (we may say towards our England)
   which he hath bestowed on them, according to his mercies, and according
   to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses." Isa. lxiii. 7.

   And here we may go back a great deal further than Joshua could, at this
   time, in recounting God's favours towards Israel. They were not then of
   that antiquity. He had not so long a tract of time, as we have, to
   reflect and look back upon from their beginning to be a people; that
   is, the time when God took Abraham out of his father Terah's idolatrous
   family, to make him the head of a people, among whom there should be a
   plantation and nursery of true religion, from age to age, till the
   fulness of time. It was but a few hundreds of years, of which Joshua
   puts them upon the review; when he calls upon them to reflect upon, and
   look back to the years of former times. We have a far longer time to
   reflect and look back upon. Ours is a country severed and distanced, as
   you know from the rest of the world;

   Et penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos, [99]

   and we are at so remote a distance, that it is to be reckoned among the
   miracles of providence, that the gospel and Christianity should visit
   our island so soon.

   It is true, the history of so early times is so much the more
   uncertain; but such as it is, it makes Britain to begin to be
   christianized even in the first century, and as some have reported by
   the ministry of Joseph of Arimathea, who had been under the ministry of
   our Lord himself, as the Teacher come forth from God. John. iii. 2, And
   though afterwards this island of ours was invaded, first by one pagan,
   then by another; still Christianity kept its footing, so as never to be
   extinct. And when at last the romish apostacy and corruption had spread
   itself, here did more ancient primitive Christianity contend long
   against it; and with that steadfastness, and earnestness, that they
   found it impossible to make proselytes without making martyrs, even in
   those early days, And after a more general night of popish darkness had
   spread itself over this land of ours (then unhappy indeed, as the
   greatest part of the Christian world was) the dawnings of renewed light
   were earlier with us, than with a great part of the rest of Europe,
   where the reformation has obtained. We may count above three hundred
   years back ward, wherein there was most express opposition among us, by
   the bright light which then shone against the worst of the popish
   abominations. And when that light was grown brighter and brighter, unto
   a more perfect day; by what wonders of providence has our day been
   prolonged and the light of it extended for so long a space! With how
   indulgent an eye has heaven watched over us to prevent the return of
   that enchanted night and darkness, out of which we had escaped! what
   designs have there been prevented from time to time, to bring us back
   again under both a darkness and a bondage worse than Egyptian!

   And it is admirable to see and take notice, how providence hath
   signalized the very seasons of our deliverance from those dark and
   horrid designs, which have been set on foot against us; that he should
   also twice put such marks upon such a year, and such a day; upon the
   year eighty-eight in one century after another, and twice upon the
   fifth of November in the same century; and at length draw two ancient
   mercies to meet together, as it were, upon one day, and in
   eighty-eight. This seems to be an artifice in wise providence to
   accommodate itself to our unapprehensive, and less retentive minds;
   that he should so mark out for us times and seasons, that when such a
   year, and such a day reverted, we might recollect ourselves and
   consider, and also those that shall come after us: "Oh, how hath God
   signalized these days, by special favours and kindnesses to England!
   and all aiming at one mark, that is, to keep us safe from that popish
   delusion and all the abominations which it sheltered, that he had
   before delivered us from; that we might not be brought back again, and
   return into so dismal, so gloomy, and so imbondaged a state.

   And it concerns us to bethink ourselves as to this our last
   deliverance, now seven years ago the fifth of November 1688; in what a
   state of things we then were, and how our matters stood when a divine
   hand was reached forth towards us, to pluck us out of the gulph into
   which we were sinking. We are to consider in how prepared a posture all
   things were for our destruction, as to our most principal concerns;
   those especially of our religion, than which we are to count nothing
   more So. The providence of God ordered us the view of our danger; not
   that it might overtake, or oppress us, or end in our ruin, but that it
   might excite in us so much higher gratitude when he should deliver us.
   That is, in the course of providence he let it come to pass, that we
   should be under the power of a popish prince; intent to promote his own
   religion: that things should proceed so far, as that we should see
   mass-houses set up, even in the very metropolis of England; in this
   very city, Jesuits' schools opened; colleges in our universities
   seized, to serve the same purpose; and an Irish army brought into our
   bowels, easily to be assisted, if there should be occasion, by a French
   one; even when we knew how strict the confederacy was between those two
   princes, and by what methods the latter, to wit, the king of France,
   had been labouring to reduce all that were under his government to one
   religion, namely that of popery.

   And where are they now that dispute whether a providence governs this
   world? Is there no specimen, no appearance of a divine hand in this?
   That all the while that mighty French monarch was gradually springing
   up, until at length he should appear on the public stage with so
   aspiring a mind, as to think himself capable of giving law and a
   religion to all the world beside; as if he was not only greater, and
   more potent, but wiser too than all the rest of mankind, and a better
   judge of religion: I say, that while he was gradually springing up to
   this pitch, God should be forming his own instrument to appear upon the
   stage too, when it should be most seasonable? A prince, in such
   circumstances, and with such inclinations too! formed, and fitted, and
   placed on the stage, on purpose to give check (and we hope mate too) to
   that ambitious one, who made it his business, and doth still make it
   his business, to enslave, not only the bodies, but the minds and
   consciences too of all, to whom his power can reach and extend itself!
   is there, I say, nothing of a divine hand in all this? We know indeed
   what extraordinary, unlimited power could otherwise have done; but God
   uses to work by ordinary means. And if he had not marked out this way,
   if he had not raised up such a one, if he had not had this in his
   councils; to wit, "While that prince is gradually springing up, whom I
   design to be a just scourge to a wicked European people, I will have
   one that shall spring up by degrees at the same time, that shall
   prevent his being more than a scourge, that though he shall chastise
   yet he shall not destroy." I say if God had not done so, by way of
   opposition to those horrid designs that were on foot; we might suppose
   it as probable a means for any of us to repel the inundation of the sea
   by our breath, as by any other means in view to have prevented a
   universal deluge of the greatest calamities and miseries, all Europe
   over, that could be thought of or imagined.

   And if there be a divine hand eminently appearing in all this, and in a
   way of favour, if God hath been doing us, and the nations about us
   good; all this ought to be acknowledged with the most grateful mention,
   and with hearts full of thanksgiving. For, consider, What if this had
   not been? Then had there nothing been in view to prevent our case, long
   before this day, from being like theirs, who professed the Protestant
   religion in France, and in Peidmont. We might come nearer home, even to
   Ireland; which though we look upon it as a firebrand plucked out of the
   fire, yet we should consider that, and ourselves as firebrands, not
   plucked out, but consuming in the fire, till we, and our religion,
   should have been reduced to nothing. If we would urge our own souls to
   a grateful commemoration of the goodness God hath shewn, and the great
   things lie hath done for us; we should, I say, state the case so as it
   would have been, if these things had not been wrought, and done for us.

   Think then, what would have been our case! to be dragooned out of our
   habitations, our estates, and our families; out of our religion, our
   consciences, and eternal hopes, if we had not patiently comported with
   the former, to save the latter! And whereas the case of our brethren in
   France was such, that they had some refuges, some retreats, and knew
   whither to go; yet if the overflowing calamity had deluged all, us as
   well as them, whither should we have fled? what retreat should we have
   had?

   Think we with ourselves, how many peaceful years have gone over our
   heads! Think too by what miracles of providence our state hath been
   preserved these several successive years! seven years past, and how
   much more than seven might we look back upon! One valuable life indeed
   (most valuable! and of precious savour) hath been plucked away from the
   throne; [100] but the other is preserved: and by how slender a thread
   doth so great a weight hang, and depend, as our visible All! How
   strangely is that life preserved from year to year! so as that after
   every campaign, we have, as it were, a king given us anew, as by a
   resurrection from the dead. Through so many surrounding deaths is he
   kept, and still from time to time returned, and brought safe back again
   to us; whereas the continuation of such a thread by moments, hath so
   great a weight hanging upon it, that if there had been an intercision,
   as there might have been in a moment, it is inexpressible, yea
   inconceivable, what miseries might have come upon us. Though, as was
   said before, we are not to measure or circumscribe omnipotence, but we
   are to speak and judge of things according to the appearance, which
   they carry to our view; who are not expected to judge with the judgment
   of God, but with the judgment of men, of what is obvious to our notice.
   And upon all these accounts we have cause to own even with the most
   sincere gratitude, that God hath all this while been doing us good, and
   has done it of his own good pleasure, and in very peculiar kinds and
   respects. But then, I must come to the

   2. Part too, that I may be just to the truth and to you, to shew how
   vain a thing it would be (though we are obliged to acknowledge, and
   indeed to own it with the greatest gratitude, that God hath been all
   this while doing us good; yet, I say, how vain it would be) thence to
   conclude ourselves secure from destroying judgments, and consuming
   wrath; if still we grossly revolt from God, and generally offend
   against that goodness itself. And to this purpose let us,

   (1.) Cast an impartial eye upon our own provocations; and see what
   matter for divine displeasure, there is to be found among us. Certainly
   there is what may equal that of this people, who are our present
   exemplar. It may be some may say, "We are not for serving strange gods,
   as they did." But pray, how many are there who are for worshipping no
   God at all! Set the atheism of the one, against the idolatry of the
   other. And were the Israelites for worshipping strange and false gods?
   O, what multitudes among us are there, who cannot be supposed to be
   less guilty for their slight and careless and trifling worship of the
   true God; while they acknowledge and own him in all the perfections and
   excellencies of his being, which exalt him far above all blessing and
   praise! who come to worshipping assemblies with as slight minds, as
   others carry with them to the play-house! O, what provocation is there
   in this! How provoking is their wickedness, who deny the Lord that
   bought them! who contend even against his Deity itself, his All; who is
   to us our All in all, and upon whom our eternal hopes depend! How
   horrid is it to consider the gross immoralities that shelter themselves
   among us under the abused, and usurped Christian name! So that the
   justice, the honesty, the temperance, the veracity, which were to be
   found among pagans should be, from time to time, produceable to rebuke
   and shame us for their contraries, which we allow ourselves in, while
   we call ourselves Christians! Are not these high and great
   provocations? And then, let us hereupon consider,

   (2.) What pretence have we to think ourselves secure from vindictive
   severities, or that wrath should not come upon us, even until it
   consume us, after God hath done us so much good? Is his doing us good,
   or his having done us good, any security? Pray let us weigh some
   considerations with reference to this.

   [1.] How was it any security to the Jews? Do not we find,
   notwithstanding all the good which God had done for them, that yet
   there were times and seasons when their armies were routed, that they
   could not stand before their enemies? When their ark, in which they
   gloried (that peculiar symbol of the divine presence) was made a
   captive to their enemies, and ravished away from them by paganish
   hands? Was there not a time, when notwithstanding all the good which
   God had done them, the Assyrian power sacked and enslaved their
   country, and they were carried away even beyond Babylon? Did all the
   good, which God had formerly done them, protect their country from
   invasion; their great city, which was the glory and praise of the
   earth, from being plundered and ravaged; their temple, one of the
   wonders of the world, from being turned into a ruinous heap? Again let
   us consider,

   [2.] Can we pretend any antecedent right to any of those favours, by
   which our state is distinguished from others, who have been most
   miserable round about us? Can we pretend any better right than the Jews
   had? They had a right by promise, we have not a right so much as by
   promise. Did God ever promise us that we should have peace in our own
   bowels, when the nations round about us should be involved in blood and
   ruin, and this for seven years together? This people had what they
   enjoyed by promise; but so conditional, so limited, as not to be a bar
   against such vindictive judgments, as did actually befall them: but we
   have not so much to say as that. We have no such prior right to our
   enjoyments, as that we can say, if such and such judgments should
   befall us, God would do us wrong; that if he should let our houses be
   burnt, our goods rifled, and ourselves come under oppression, bonds,
   tyranny, slavery, we should be injured, and wrong would be done to us
   by the common Ruler of the world. Dare any of us be so hardy as to say
   so? If we should, that alone would be provocation enough to bring the
   utmost of divine severities upon us; for we can claim no such right
   without invading his, who is the common Lord of all. And again,

   [3.] Let it be considered, whether it is not very apparent that God
   hath done us all that good, all the while, which we have been the
   continual subjects of. Was it not all from him? Is it not he that
   protected our peace and religion hitherto; and kept off from us
   calamities and miseries, wherein others are involved? If we should deny
   that God hath done all this for us, even that itself were enough to
   give him matter of most terrible controversy against us. But,

   [4.] If we do grant, that God hath done all this for us (ex empted us
   all this while from miseries and ruins, put us under his protection,
   and that shadow, which his wings have spread over us; if we will grant,
   I say, that God vouchsafes us the mercy of all these years, which we
   have enjoyed) then let us consider, whether we must not apprehend him
   to have had some end, in such peculiar vouchsafements of favour to us.
   Is he indeed most infinitely wise, and in all respects the most
   absolutely perfect? And what! can he act without design? Can he in so
   distinguishing a way have shewn favour to us, and not to others, as it
   were by casualty? or without saying, "So I will do. When I suffer such
   and such miseries to fall upon a people, professing my name, in France,
   in Hungary, in Piedmont, in Ireland, and elsewhere; yet I will cover
   and shelter those who profess my name in England?" Do we think this was
   without design or end?

   [5.] If there be a design, if God aims at some end in all this, let it
   be considered, whether it is not an end worthy of himself; an end that
   was suitable to the wisdom, the excellency, and greatness of a God? And
   if so, then

   [6.] Consider, whether we can suppose it to be an end worthy of God,
   and suitable unto his universal perfection, only to gratify our
   inclination, by keeping off such and such miseries and calamities from
   us; when he hath not done it from others, round about us. Why was it
   more worthy of God to gratify the desires, and inclinations in this
   kind, of an Englishman, than of a Frenchman, or an Hungarian, and the
   like? Was his end only, that he might not disturb and disquiet a people
   unwilling to be disturbed, and not patient of molestation? Was this his
   end? But

   [7.] If his end was higher and more Godlike, that is, that we might
   have a peaceful opportunity of enjoying the gospel, and improving it
   through such a tract of time; then let us consider, whether we have
   answered this end. Where are our advances? where is our profit? wherein
   is it to be seen that such a people have, for seven years together,
   lived under a peaceful state, and dispensation of the truth, and
   ordinances of the everlasting gospel; which with others have been
   discontinued, and with many actually broken off? Pray, where is the
   difference? wherein are we better after all than they? We have
   experienced God's great goodness; and may still, if we continue in his
   goodness, and be attempered and suited thereto, in the disposition of
   our spirits, but if there is no such thing, what comes next but
   severity? Behold (saith the apostle) the goodness and severity of God!
   which are conjoined upon the distinct suppositions which are there put
   in the context Rom. xi. 22. And in the next place,

   [8.] Let us but consider, whether. we dare, any of us, lay a claim as
   matter of right, unto any of those private temporal mercies that we
   severally enjoy; namely, the health, the strength, the competent
   provisions which we find, and the reputation we have in the world, or
   with one another. Can any f us lay a claim to any of these good things,
   considered in a private, or a personal, regard? If we cannot, then the
   good state of a people, which results from the particular enjoyments,
   accommodations, and comforts, of the several individuals, is owing
   entirely to the goodness and mercy of God. And who of us can say,
   "Because I have health this hour, therefore I shall certainly have it
   the next; I have health to-day, therefore I shall have it the next?"
   and so on. Can any of us say, "If we have peace this month, or this
   year, that we shall have it the next month, or year? Or, as we have now
   free opportunities of worshipping God, so shall we have in all future
   time?" How absurd reasoning would all this be! But then consider,
   further,

   [9.] That greater miseries, than can be comprehended with in the
   compass of time, are due to every impenitent sinner; to every one who
   is not converted, or turned effectually unto God in Christ. What do we
   talk of their not being liable unto the troubles, the calamities, and
   miseries, that lie within the mea sure of time; who, in the mean while,
   are liable unto eternal miseries? that they are not liable to have
   their houses, or their city burnt, who are liable to that fire, which
   can never be quenched? and to have it said to them, "Depart ye cursed
   in to everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." Mat.
   xxv. 41. And consider,

   [10.] That they who live under the gospel, and obey it not, nor comply
   with the gracious design of it are every way liable to greater
   severities, than ungospelized nations ever were. Would you think it a
   hard saying, if one should positively determine, that London is
   generally liable to more terrible things, than Sodom was, or Gomorrah?
   Hath not our Lord himself told us, that the people among whom he
   conversed, of Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, were exposed to worse
   calamities, than Sodom and Gomorrah, or than Tyre and Sidon? Mat. xi.
   21-25. We should consider this, not only with conviction but with
   consternation, to think what we are on this account liable to; as
   having still such matter of provocation, as you have heard found among
   us.

   And therefore now, since it cannot with the least modesty be pretended
   that we are not liable, because God hath done us so much good, to the
   suffering of such grievous evils, as have been mentioned; as we have in
   view before us, even in ancient and in modern example: if this, I say,
   cannot with modesty be pretended, the most fruitful inquiry will be,
   how we shall demean ourselves agreeable to the state of our case, as
   being exposed to the terrible severities of consuming vengeance. Is it
   plain? doth the thing speak itself, that we are liable to very severe
   consuming judgments? What shall we do hereupon? how shall we demean
   ourselves, or what shall be our deportment in this case? I shall shut
   up this discourse with a few words in answer to this.

   First, Let us not hereupon cease from the most grateful
   acknowledgements of God's great goodness to us, in lengthening out our
   tranquillity so far, as he hath been pleased to do. For wherein he hath
   done us good, even freely, and from mere good pleasure; certainly the
   most grateful acknowledgements are due. We are to. give thanks with the
   most serious gratitude for all that good, which we could never claim;
   and to which we could not pretend that we had any right. But,

   Secondly: Though we are to rejoice in the remembrance, and continual
   observation of God's great goodness, yet we are to mingle trembling
   with rejoicing ("Rejoice with trembling") that is, we are to take heed
   of being secure. Our hearts should not be secure, when our state is
   not. It is unbecoming a prudent and considering christian (our state
   being stated as you have heard) to admit such a thing as a drowsy
   slumbering security, to enwrap, and stupify his heart! or that we
   should be of them, that cry peace, peace to themselves, when sudden
   destruction may be at the door. "Therefore let us not sleep as do
   others," lest such a day of calamity should overtake us as a thief. It
   is very unbecoming a wise man to be liable to a surprise, while our
   case is so stated, standing in view as it doth before us.

   Thirdly: We should have also inwrought into the temper of our spirits,
   a firm persuasion that God is to be justified, even upon the
   supposition that the most destructive, and consuming calamities should
   befall us. Let this be inlaid deeply as a principle with us, if any
   thing should fall out, or whenever calamities or judgments befall us,
   that it is our business the first thing we do, and shall be continually
   upon that supposition, to say, "Righteous art thou O Lord"! Jerem. xii.
   1. While we have no right to be indemnified, he hath a right to punish.
   Again,

   Fourthly: We should also labour to keep our hearts loose from all our
   temporal enjoyments, and good things; that they may not be torn away
   from us by violence, but by an implicit, previous consent. "Lord, I
   have made over my All to thee. I have resigned all into thy hands. If
   it shall make for the honour of thy justice, and the dignity of thy
   government, for me to be involved in calamities and ruins (as no one
   can pretend to claim an exemption) I submit to it; and lay myself, and
   all at thy foot. I desire that my heart may cleave to nothing against
   thee, nor against any determination of thine. I live in my house, as
   having no right to it. I go out, as having no certainty, or assurance
   to return. I lie down in it, as if I expected to arise in the midst of
   flames." And so in reference to all the temporal good things we enjoy,
   we should lie before him as so many convicted creatures, ready to
   receive our judgment from his hand. For even his Moseses and his
   Aarons, while he vouchsafeth them mercy, and a pardon, with respect to
   their eternal concernments; yet, in reference to their temporal
   concerns, he may take vengeance upon their inventions. Psal. xcix. 8.
   And in the

   Last place: Make sure your interest in eternal good things, by corning
   to a covenant closure with God in Christ. Then shall your hearts not be
   afraid of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh. Then will you be
   able to apply to yourselves that sentence of the divine wisdom, the Son
   of God (for so we are to understand it, the supreme, archetypical, and
   eternal wisdom) "He that hearkeneth to me shall dwell safely, and shall
   be quiet from the fear of evil"; (Prov. i. 38,) and so shall we have a
   calm, a quiet, a serenity in our own spirits; not from presuming, or
   because we conclude we shall not suffer, but upon a supposition that we
   shall: as was said to the church of Smyrna. "Fear none of those things
   which thou shall suffer." Revel. ii. 10. This is the way not to be in
   an astonishment, or confusion at such a time; having our hearts
   possessed with the faith of such a saying as this, which is surer and
   more stable, than the foundations of heaven and earth: When the world
   passeth away, and the lust thereof, he that doeth the will of God
   abideth for ever. 1 John ii. 17. Such a one may say, "I shall be
   unconcerned in the common ruin, when that day of the Lord cometh, which
   shall burn as an oven. When the whole hemisphere shall be like one
   fiery vault burning as an oven, I shall not be concerned in this
   destruction. All that have vital union with the Son of God shall be
   caught up to meet their Redeemer in the air, and be for ever with the
   Lord. I can see all this world consumed, and think myself to have lost
   nothing. My good lieth not here. My treasure is in heaven, and my
   principal interest is there."

   Let this matter be once put out of doubt; and then with how cheerful,
   with how childlike, with how submissive spirits, may we expect and wait
   for the most dismal, and the most dreadful things, that can fall out
   within the compass of time!

   THE following serious and pathetic discourse was preached by the
   author, at Brixham in Devonshire, when he was about twenty-eight years
   of age; but upon what occasion is not certainly known. [101] It was
   communicated to the editor by a worthy gentleman in the West of
   England, who after mature deliberation has resolved to give it a place
   in this collection; not only because it is well calculated to make
   serious impressions on every reader, but also as it is a specimen of
   the excellent author's manner of preaching in his youth. There is, he
   thinks, no reason to doubt its being genuine; since (to use Dr. Evans's
   expression) it plainly carries in it the marks, which to a person of
   taste always distinguish his performances.

   The following extracts from a few letters, sent to the editor by the
   gentleman, to whom the world is obliged for this excellent discourse,
   will be sufficient to give an account of it.

   The Sermon (says he) bears date January, 1658; which, I believe, must
   be 58-9. For though it is not impossible but Mr. Howe might have been
   at Brixham, in January, 58; yet as the protector (Oliver) kept him much
   at Whitehall, it is not so likely to be preached then, as the year
   after: about which time he returned into the West. [102] For though he
   continued a little while in the same relation to the protector Richard,
   that he did to his father; yet Dr. Calamy tells us, he cannot find that
   he continued longer at court, than October, 58.

   The copy was transcribed in the year 59. It is exceeding fair, and
   perfect. The spirit and language of it (the discourse) plainly evince
   it to be the production of that masterly hand. The writer, who took it
   after him, does not seem to have dropped any thing, whereby the sense
   is any way maimed; and has religiously copied it out, as appears from
   the repetitions, which were made for the relief of the hearers' memory.
   [103]

   Though Mr. Howe has something to the same purpose with part of the
   contents of this sermon, in his treatise on Delighting in God, Part II.
   page 389-395, folio edition, [104] as one might reasonably expect; yet,
   though there are some of the thoughts, he has not only pursued the
   subject much farther, but in a very different manner: insomuch that
   there can be no room for saying it is publishing the same thing over
   again, which is an injury some eminent authors have suffered after
   their death. Besides the forementioned place there can be no other,
   where he has any thing so near to the purpose.

   That which brought our author on this side our country (for his charge
   lay 50 miles distant, to which he was lately returned) was his being
   related to the Upton family, of Lupton; which lies in the parish of
   Brixham, where, "the vanity of man as mortal," took its birth.

   It is very probable, that it was preached at once; and I have
   calculated on what day of the week, January 23, 1658-9, fell. And as D
   was the dominical letter for that year, the 23d. was a Friday; but if
   it was preached in 57-8, as the dominical letter was E, it was on a
   Thursday. So that as it could not be preached en a Lord's day, it was
   therefore most likely preached at once. [105] To all which the
   gentleman adds the following general remark; the latter part of which,
   at least, is very just.

   Though his style is not so smooth as some, yet it is as intelligible as
   any. And a person has this for his encouragement, that he is always
   sure to find something in Mr. Howe, that is well worth his pains.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [101] It is entitled in the manuscript, "A Sermon preached at Brixham
   the 23d. day of January, 1658; by Mr. John Howe, a faithful minister of
   the gospel pf Jesus Christ."

   [102] Meaning to Torrington, in Devonshire.

   [103] This discourse indeed abounds with repetitions, more by far than
   any other the editor has seen of Mr. Howe's in manuscript; most of
   which be omitted in his transcript of it designed for the press, and he
   hopes without the least injury to the whole. The sense is entire, and
   delivered throughout in the author's own words.

   [104] There seems to be no resemblance, scarcely, in the whole sermon,
   to any thing in the pages here referred to; except in page 390: where
   the text is indeed mentioned, and briefly descanted upon, and that is
   all. [Vide vol. 2, p. 188, of this edition.]

   [105] It is very probable it was preached on a fast-day; either a
   private one or one of those public fast-days, which were frequently
   solemnised by authority before the restoration.

SERMON XIII. [106]

   Psalm ix. 17.

   The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget
   God.

   I CANNOT spend time in opening to you the connexion of these words,
   with those that go before. In the words themselves you have these two
   things more especially remarkable; to wit, the description, and the
   doom of wicked men. Their description you have in these words, that
   they are such as do forget God; and their doom is, that they shall be
   turned into hell. So that accordingly there are two observations that
   offer themselves to our view from this scripture.

   FIRST, That it is the property of wicked men to forget God. And,

   SECONDLY, That it shall be the portion of wicked men, who forget God,
   to be turned into hell. These two I intend to handle together in this
   order.

   I. I shall shew you what we are here to understand by the wicked.

   II. What by forgetting God. And then,

   III. I shall evince unto you, that they are wicked persons, who do
   forget God. And then,

   IV. That such wicked persons shall be turned into hell. And so,

   V. Make use and application of the whole together.

   I. I shall briefly shew you what we are to understand by these wicked,
   that the text speaks of. In the

   1. Place, negatively, we are not to understand by the wicked here, all
   persons that have sin in them. There are a sort of men in the world,
   that will confess themselves sinners; who yet dare to acquit themselves
   of wickedness. Thus David speaks; "I have kept the ways of the Lord,
   and have not wickedly departed from my God." Psal. xviii. 21. Every
   man, that hath sin in him, is not presently a wicked person.

   2. We are not to understand it neither of only gross sinners. As we are
   not to extend the signification of the word, so as to take in the
   former, so nor must we so much narrow it, as to take in only the
   latter. We are not to think that they are only spoken of as wicked
   ones, who live in gross, and profane wickedness; so as that every one
   may characterize and point at them as wicked persons. No, there are
   wicked ones that pass under the notion of honest, and good men,
   according to common estimation; and there is such a thing as
   heart-wickedness, which is hidden and concealed from the eyes of the
   world, so as that others cannot take notice of it.

   And therefore, affirmatively, by the wicked here we must understand
   unregenerate persons; whoever they are, that are in a state of
   unregeneracy. Whether they be open and gross sinners, or secret sinners
   only, it is all one for that: if they be such as the work of renovation
   hath not yet passed upon, they are those whom this scripture doth here
   intend by wicked ones.

   II. In the second place we are to inquire what is meant by forgetting
   of God. The character, by which these wicked persons in the text are
   described, is, that they are such as forget God. Wherein then does this
   forgetting God consist? That is what we are next to consider. And in
   order to find out what we are to understand by it, our most direct
   course will be to consider, what is to be stated in opposition
   hereunto. And it is obvious at first sight, that it is thinking of God;
   as not to think of God, is to forget him. But here we must a little
   more particularly inquire, What is this thinking of God, to which the
   forgetting him must be understood to be opposed here? And, negatively,

   1. We are not to understand by it a continual thinking of God; that is,
   always, every moment, and without ceasing. This you may easily imagine
   to be impossible, and I need say no more of it.

   2. Yet, on the other hand, we are not to understand by it neither a
   thinking of God slightly and seldom. Superficial, and overly thoughts
   of God now and then, may well enough consist with that forgetting of
   God which is here spoken of.

   And therefore, affirmatively, this forgetting of God stands in
   opposition to frequent and ordinary, serious and heart-affecting
   thoughts of God. That person is here spoken of as a wicked man that
   forgets God, who does not think of him frequently and with affection;
   with fear, and delight, and those affections that are suitable to
   serious thoughts of God. "How precious (says the Psalmist) are thy
   thoughts unto me O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count
   them they are more in number than the sand: when I awake I am still
   with thee." Psal. cxxxix. 17, 18. These thoughts of God, of which the
   Psalmist speaks, are such as God is the object of; as plainly appears
   from what is added by way of antithesis, "When I awake I am still with
   thee." My thoughts are ever working towards thee, as soon as ever I
   awake. Now here is this two fold character of such thoughts; to wit,
   that they are precious, and they are numerous.

   (1.) They are precious thoughts; such as affect a man's heart, and
   ravish the soul. Now in opposition to this, persons that forget God
   have no such thoughts of him; that is, they have no joyous, pleasant,
   and delightful thoughts concerning God, such as the Psalmist speaks of;
   who also says, "My meditation of him shall be sweet, I will be glad in
   the Lord." Psal. civ. 34. So that it is such a forgetfulness of God,
   which is here spoken of, that stands in opposition to such a
   remembrance of him as reaches the heart, takes the soul, and turns all
   that is within a man towards God. And then,

   (2.) They are numerous thoughts, as well as precious ones. They are not
   only sweet and pleasant, but they are frequent also. "If I should count
   them (says the Psalmist) they are more in number than the sand." Such
   are my thoughts of God, so frequent and numerous, and they so flow into
   my soul, and so often recur again and again; that if I go to count
   them, I may as well attempt to count the sands on the sea-shore: how
   great is the sum of them! Now it is in opposition to such thoughts of
   God that this forgetfulness must be understood. They are forgetful of
   God; the wicked persons, whom the text speaks of, who have not such
   thoughts of God frequently recurring upon their spirits, so as to
   affect and ravish them, as you heard before. And thus you see what this
   forgetfulness of God is, which the Psalmist speaks of. The next thing
   that is now to be done is,

   III. To shew you the connexion between these two things,which have been
   opened to you; or to evince, that those who have no such thoughts of
   God, as these which we speak of, are wicked persons. So you see the
   text plainly represents the matter; "The wicked shall be turned into
   hell, and all the nations that forget God." Why, to forget God, and to
   be a wicked person, is all one. And these two things will abundantly
   evince the truth of this assertion: namely, that this forgetfulness of
   God excludes the prime and main essentials of religion; and also
   includes in it the highest and most heinous pieces of wickedness and
   therefore must needs denominate the subject, a wicked person.

   1. Forgetfulness of God excludes the chief and main essentials of all
   religion. I shall instance in a few which you will easily discern, at
   first sight, a forgetfulness of God must necessarily exclude, As,

   (I.) It excludes the esteem and love of God, as our highest happiness,
   and chief good. It is a plain case, that this is a most essential part
   of religion; and you will easily acknowledge, that he must needs be a
   wicked man with a witness that doth not esteem God, nor love him as his
   chief good. To esteem God as our highest happiness is to take him for
   our God; and the man that doth not this, disowns God as none of his.
   For when you say, "God is our God, and we are his people," what do you
   mean by it? Do you mean only the name of God, without any relation to
   him as your chief and highest good? is that all? Why, if there be any
   thing beyond a bare name, where or what is it? You must say it is this;
   God is my portion, happiness and delight; he it is whom I esteem, and
   love, beyond all the things of this world." Nothing else can be a
   taking, or owning God to be your God. This is the very sum of all that
   God doth require from any people that would be related to him and own
   him for their God. "And now Israel what doth the Lord thy God require
   of thee? but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to
   love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all
   thy soul." Deut. x. 12. "Otherwise," as if he had said, you disown all
   relation to me. "If it be not thus, you are never to reckon me as your
   God. If your hearts and souls and strength do not run out in love to
   me, you are none of mine, and I am none of yours." And God is again on
   the same terms with his people. "Hear O my people, and I will testify
   against thee; O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me: there shall no
   strange god be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any strange god. I
   am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt."
   Psal. lxxxi. 8, 9, 10. The plain tenour of this scripture is this. "If
   you will have any thing at all to do with me, if you pretend any
   obedience or affection to me, you must take me alone to be your God;
   you must not entertain any strange god; there must be no god that must
   be higher in your thoughts than I, or adored and loved more than
   myself. If it be not so, I there are such among you as will not thus
   hearken to me, I have nothing to do with you." Thus it is evident, that
   it must needs be an essential thing in religion for a man to love, and
   esteem God above all things; he must esteem him as his highest,
   chiefest, and most excellent good: for it is such a valuing of God that
   can alone denominate a man religious.

   And now do but a little consider. Do you think it possible for such an
   estimation or love of God, as the highest and chiefest good, to consist
   with a forgetting of God? Can a man for get God from day to day, in the
   sense of the text, and yet esteem and love this God as his highest
   happiness, and chief good? Is this possible? Can you apprehend it to be
   possible, that a man should place the top of his felicity in God; and
   love God above all things else in the world; and yet pass from day to
   day and never think of him with delight and pleasure? Is this, think
   you, consistent with the esteem of God, as your chief good? You cannot
   be so vain as to think so. That man would be hissed at as a ridiculous
   person, that will say; "What I love above all things in the world, I
   never use to think of. I love God better than any thing, but he hath no
   place in my thoughts; I never think of him; I can pass on from day to
   day, and never have a serious thought of him." Is this possible? You
   see what the love of God in the soul doth carry in it, namely a
   remembrance of him, in the twenty-sixth chapter of Isaiah. (ver. 8.)
   "The desire of our soul is unto thee, and to the remembrance of thy
   name." That person would be scorned as a most absurd wretch, that would
   ever offer to pretend such a thing unto God, as to say, "Lord I desire
   to love thee above all things in the world, and yet I never think of
   thee; it is very seldom that thou hast any place at all in my
   thoughts." This is the most absurd, self-conceited speech that can be
   imagined. None, that have any wit at all, but know that if they have
   any understanding of God, their souls do earnestly and vehemently flow
   forth in love and desires to God. Our Lord says, "Lay up for yourselves
   treasure in heaven--for where your treasure is, there will your heart
   be also." Matth. vi. 20, 21. Lay up your treasure in heaven, that is,
   in God; let God be your treasure. You know what a man counts his
   treasure: why it is that, which is most dear and precious to him; most
   valued by him, and loved above all things else. A man will count
   nothing his treasure, but what he holds in great esteem. Let your
   treasure then, says Christ, be in heaven: that is, let God who is in
   heaven, who there makes known his glorious presence, that is enjoyed by
   saints and angels, and which we expect to enjoy; let him be your
   treasure. And where our treasure is, there will our hearts be. What you
   esteem and love beyond all things, your hearts will be continually
   working to, and your spirits flow that way. It is a mere absurd vanity
   to talk of having a treasure in God, if a man's heart be not with him.
   As she said to Samson, "How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine
   heart is not with me." Judg. xvi. 15. So the soul is apt to say it
   loves God, and counts him its treasure, and highest happiness, when,
   alas! the heart is not with him. We find that a light esteeming of God,
   is the same thing with for getting him, and those expressions are used
   as synonymous by Moses. "Jeshurun forsook God that made him, and he
   lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation!" And then presently it
   follows, "Of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
   forgotten God that formed thee." Deut. xxxii. 15, 18. Thus to make a
   light account of God is the same thing, as to forget him; and therefore
   that person has never yet set one foot towards religion, who hath not
   yet made God his chief happiness, the only joy and delight of his soul.
   Therefore this is one thing, that forgetfulness of God doth exclude the
   estimation and love of God, as our portion and chief good.

   (2.) Forgetfulness of God excludes dependance on God as our strength,
   and the life and stay of our souls; which is also a most essential
   piece of religion. That man knows nothing at all practically in matters
   of religion, that does not live in a continual dependance upon God as
   the life, and strength, and support of the soul. They are spoken of as
   persons who can not possibly obtain salvation, while in their present
   state, who are not yet come to that believing in God, which carries the
   whole heart to acquiesce, and rest and centre in God. "Who soever shall
   call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. But how shall they call on
   him, in whom they have not believed?" Rom. x. 13, 14. Calling upon God
   is a thing essentially necessary unto salvation, and believing in him
   is indispensably necessary unto calling upon him. It is put for the
   whole worship of God: and it is impossible for a soul ever thus to call
   upon God; that is, to worship him, to live subject to him, and be
   devoted and given up to him, who doth not believe in him. And this
   believing in God respects him as the stay, and strength of a man's
   soul. It plainly implies a sensibleness of its being utterly impossible
   that I should subsist or live without God; and supposes a constant
   reliance upon him as my God, who is my very life and strength. And
   therefore you find how those, who do not so, are derided by the
   Psalmist. "The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him:
   Lo! this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the
   abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
   But I am like a green olive-tree, in the house of God; I trust in the
   mercy of God for ever and ever." Psal. lii. 6, 7, 8. The soul that is
   truly religious is by trust so planted into the very mercy of God, as I
   may speak; that there it is rooted, and sprouts as a tree doth, in the
   soul that bears it. But they are outcasts, and a company of profane
   irreligious wretches, that do not thus trust in God, and make him the
   stay, and sup port of their souls. "Lo, this is the man that made not
   God his strength!" It is remarkable to see in how ludicrous a way such
   persons are spoken of, as if they were to be hissed out of the
   creation. "Lo, there is a man that lives without God! a person not fit
   to be numbered among men! Away with him as a most ridiculous wretch,
   who thinks to live without staying upon God!"

   Trust in God then is essential to religion. And do you think that this
   can possibly consist with forgetting of God? Can a man trust in God, as
   the stay and support of his life, of whom he is unmindful? who can pass
   one day after another, and never vouchsafe him a serious thought? Trust
   in God is a continual thing. I do not mean that it is to be exercised
   without intermission, but that it is an habitual dependance. And
   therefore it is said, "The just shall live by faith." Heb. x. 38. We
   live by breathing, and it will not serve our turn to breathe to-day,
   and live by that breath many days hereafter. No, that which we live by
   is a continual thing. And thus the just shall live by a continual
   reliance and dependance on God; which implies a mindfulness of him.
   When the Psalmist speaks of that trust, which he reposed in God, he
   speaks of it in this language; "I have set the Lord always before me,
   because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved." Psal. xvi. 8.
   Here was a continual minding of God. What is it to have God always
   before us, but to have him the prime, and the principal object of our
   thoughts? so as that there is nothing, on which our eye doth so much
   fix, as it doth on God. And this stands with that conjunction, or that
   dependance which the soul hath on God. So again: "Mine eyes are ever
   towards the Lord, for he shall pluck my feet out of the net." xxv. 15.
   That is, My reliance is upon God; mine eye is continually towards him,
   and I have him ever in my thoughts. It is he in whom I live, and from
   whom I have all my expectation. Thus it is impossible, that a man
   should be in this sense a religious person who is forgetful of God;
   since he who thinks not upon him, cannot be supposed to depend upon him
   as the life and strength of his soul.

   (3.) Forgetfulness of God excludes also the fear of God; and that awful
   subjection unto his laws and commands, as our rule, wherein the soul
   should continually live: and this is too an essential part of religion,
   as is well known to all that understand any thing of religion. Can he
   ever be said to be a religious man, that doth not live in the fear of
   God? Why, it is so essential a piece of religion, that the Scripture
   doth often call all religion by that very thing, the fear of God. And
   hence it is also, that you find all wickedness summed up in this very
   expression; "There is no fear of God before their eyes." Rom. iii. 18.
   The apostle had been describing a wicked man at large, out of some of
   the psalms, (xiv. liii., &c.) and this is that which he gathers up as
   the whole of that wickedness he had been pointing out; to wit, there is
   no fear of God before their eyes. They are wicked persons with a
   witness that do not fear God, that live without having any fear of God
   before their eyes. And must not forgetfulness of God necessarily
   exclude the fear of God? What! Can any man be said to fear him, whom he
   thinks not of? to fear God when he minds him not, when he hath him not
   in all his thoughts? Do but observe the connexion between this passage
   and the eleventh verse of the same chapter, quoted out of the psalms.
   "There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after
   God." It follows "There is no fear of God before their eyes." Indeed it
   is impossible it should; if they have no thoughts of God, if their
   minds and understandings be not bent towards him, it is impossible they
   should fear him. What! fear an unthought-of God? a God that a man does
   not think of, from day to day? why, it is an absurd thing ever to be
   imagined. And therefore this is a further thing that the forgetfulness
   of God excludes; namely, that fear of God, and that reverential
   subjection, that we owe to his laws and commands, as the rule of our
   lives. And then again,

   (4.) It excludes the intention of the honour and glory of God, as our
   end. That man hath no more religion in him, than there is in a beast;
   who doth not in the ordinary course of his life design, and aim at the
   glory of God, as the supreme and ultimate end of his actions. You know
   it is that, which is required and called for from us in every thing we
   do. "Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory
   of God." 1. Cor. x. 31. This is a truth obvious to the understanding of
   every one, that every person who is religious, intends and designs the
   honour and glory of the great God, as the ultimate and chief end of the
   ordinary actions of his life. So as if a man should come and ask him,
   "For what is it that you are going about this business, and those
   affairs; and what end have you in what you do?" he will say, "That I
   may honour and glorify God in so doing." This is religion. So then it
   is not enough to bespeak a man religious, to do things that are in
   their own nature honest and just, and not liable to exception; but to
   do them designedly for the honour and glory of the great God, as his
   end. Now. do but consider. Can a man do so, and not think of God? Can
   it ever be rationally said of any one of you, that you live from day to
   day in the service of the great God, and to the honour and glory of his
   great name, as the chief and principal thing you design in your whole
   life; when you do not, from day to day, think of God? do not from
   morning to night take up one serious thought of God? Why, your own
   hearts will tell you it is utterly impossible: and a man is nothing in
   religion, who does not come up to this; who does not make the glory of
   God the ultimate end of his affairs, and the actions of his life.

   Thus you see that forgetfulness of God excludes the principal, and
   essential parts of religion. It implies, that a man doth neither
   esteem, nor value, the all-sufficiency and holiness of God, as his
   happiness and portion; nor doth he trust in the power and omnipotence
   of God, as his strength and support; nor doth he fear him, nor live in
   subjection to his laws and commands, as his rule; nor doth he aim at
   the glory of God, as his end: therefore every one who thus forgets God,
   must certainly be a wicked person.

   2. Consider also what is included in this forgetfulness of God. As it
   excludes the main essentials of religion, why so truly it does include
   the most horrid and heinous pieces of wickedness that you can think of.
   I shall instance, very briefly, in a few.

   (1.) It includes worldliness and earthly-mindedness. The soul, though
   forgetful of God, is not idle. If God be not the object of a man's
   thoughts and affections, something else is. They do not want an object.
   They find something else to employ themselves about, when they thus
   forget God and shut him out of their thoughts. For much is evidently
   implied in this scripture: "Many walk of whom I have told you often,
   and now tell you even weeping; that they are the enemies of the cross
   of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and
   whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things." Observe those
   very persons who are here spoken of as minding earthly things, are also
   said to be such as have chosen to themselves another god. Their god is
   their belly. This we are not to understand strictly, but in a large
   sense; to wit, their sensual appetite. Their belly is their god; and
   accordingly they mind earthly things, and their hearts are quite taken
   off from God. And do not think this is a light piece of wickedness, to
   live a whole life's time in this manner; especially under the gospel,
   and the profession of the Christian name. The apostle as it were weeps
   over it. It is a thing, saith he, that I cannot think of without
   passion and tears; to see a company of wretches that call themselves
   christians, and profess themselves to be so, who yet are the enemies of
   the cross of Christ: they are apparently such, for they mind earthly
   things. This then is one thing that forgetfulness of God includes,
   namely, earthly-mindedness; which is the most horrid wickedness you can
   think of, for it stands in most direct opposition to God: and therefore
   covetousness is called idolatry, or a taking another god. And then
   again,

   (2.) It includes enmity against God. It is a plain case: if men from
   day to day forget God, it is because they hate him, and cannot endure
   the thoughts of him. It is expressly spoken of some, that "they liked
   not to retain God in their knowledge." Rom. i. 28. What is it to retain
   God in our knowledge, but to have frequent actual thoughts about him?
   such as I have already spoken of, numerous and affecting thoughts. This
   is to retain God in our knowledge. But can they be said to do so, who
   do not think of God i who have no actual thoughts of God, from day to
   day? Arid why is this? Because they do not like them. The thoughts of
   God are grating, grievous, and annoying to their spirits; and therefore
   it is they do not think of him, because they do not love to think of
   him. This must needs be so, especially considering the case of such
   persons under the gospel. God is ever before their eyes, they cannot
   look any way but they must see God shining upon them. He is shining
   upon them in his creatures, in his providences, but especially in the
   ordinances of the gospel of his Son; and yet these persons will not now
   mind God, nor take notice of him. What is the reason of it? They do
   not, because they will not: or because their hearts cannot bear it.
   "Oh! take away God from my thoughts! take him away from my soul! It is
   a burden, a pressure on my spirit! I cannot bear the thoughts of God."
   Thus says the apostle; "They that are after the flesh, do mind the
   things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of
   the Spirit. For to be carnally-minded is death, but to be
   spiritually-minded is life and peace. The carnal mind is enmity against
   God." Rom. viii. 5, 6, 7. Do but observe here: he tells us that they
   who are after the flesh, or carnally-minded, will not mind any of the
   things of the Spirit of God; and that it is to be resolved into this,
   namely, that a carnal mind is enmity against God. And it is a plain
   case that such a one is an enemy to him. Therefore it is, that he minds
   the things of the earth and of flesh; and will not look after God, nor
   spend any thoughts about him. No, he will rather choose to live upon
   dirt, and feed upon trash; and to spend thoughts and affections, upon
   things that are as vile as earth and dung. And if such persons would
   but consult their hearts they would find it so. For, alas! when you are
   alone, and retired, have nothing else to do but to think of God (as
   upon such a day as this especially, when you have no other business but
   to think upon him [107] ) pray consider, Which way do your thoughts
   run? can you say, it is God that is the object of your thoughts and
   affections? that upon such a day as this, they are from morning to
   night taken up about nothing else but God? You have nothing else to do
   but to think of God; and if your thoughts decline, and turn aside after
   covetousness and the things of this world, what is this but a plain
   enmity against him? And this is what the hearts of men say; they rather
   choose the most despicable, base objects to spend, their thoughts upon,
   than about God. And is it, think you, a light piece of wickedness for a
   man to have such an enmity in his heart against God? And then again,

   (3.) In the third place, forgetfulness of God includes in it plainly a
   contempt of him; or implies that we have a base, low, dishonourable
   esteem of God. It is said (in the psalm next to that in which is my
   text) of the wicked man, that "God is not in all his thoughts." Psal.
   x. 4. The wicked wretch passes from day to day, and never affords God a
   serious thought nor allows him a place there. And what is the reason of
   it? Why the Psalmist puts it plainly upon an open manifest contempt of
   God. "Wherefore (saith he) doth the wicked contemn God?" Ver. 13. He
   speaks, as indeed the interrogation imports, with a kind of passion.
   Oh! wherefore is it? what heart can think of a reason, why any man
   should contemn God? In short, their taking low base things into their
   thoughts while they shut out God, plainly proceeds from a contempt of
   him, and because they despise him in their own hearts. And,

   (4.) To add no more, forg4tfulness of God implies atheism; which
   involves in it all wickedness, as being the root and bottom of all.
   Persons who forget God, plainly deny in their own hearts, that there is
   such a one; who ought to be the highest supreme object of their
   thoughts and affections. This evidently appears from the connexion of
   the beginning of the fourteenth psalm, with the following verses. "The
   fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. They are corrupt, they
   Lave done abominable works. The Lord looked down from heaven, upon the
   children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek
   God." And the report you have is this: "They are all gone aside; they
   are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no not
   one." There is not a person to be found among all these wretches that
   under stands, or seeks after God; or hath any serious thoughts or
   consideration about him. And what is the reason of all this? Why, like
   fools as they are, they have said in their hearts, that there is no
   God: and hence it is that their minds and under standings have quite
   forgotten, and given over to look towards him; whereas "he that comes
   to God must believe that he is, and that he is the rewarder of them
   that diligently seek him." Heb. xi. 6. They are corrupted within
   themselves, and then surmise that there is no such Being to whom they
   are accountable; and therefore they live securely, neglecting and
   forget ting him, from day to day, through their whole life. There is
   also a like connexion in the fiftieth psalm, towards the latter end.
   "These things hast thou done (having summed up a great many kinds of
   wickedness before in the preceding verses) and I kept silence. Thou
   thoughtest that I was altogether such a one, as thyself; but I will
   reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes. Now consider
   this, ye that forget God!" To deny any of God's essential attributes,
   is to take away his being. To say, that he is not so holy, as to hate
   sin; that he is not so just, as to revenge and punish sinners; is to
   say, that he is not.

   Well! this you see is connected with forgetting of God. But this God
   whom you slight, and make so little reckoning f; this God, I say, will
   reprove you. And I pray, consider ye that forget God, who have all this
   while looked upon him, as if he was like the idols of this world, that
   the time is coming when he will set your sins in order before your
   faces.

   And thus I have evinced to you this truth, that they are wicked persons
   who forget God; which is evidenced thus: to wit, forgetfulness of God
   excludes all religion, and also includes all wickedness; and what would
   you have more? It must needs then denominate such a person, who lives
   in the guilt of it, a wicked person with a witness; since it grasps
   within its compass all wickedness and shuts out all religion. [108]

   IV. The fourth thing propounded to be spoken to, was this; namely, That
   these wicked persons, who thus live in a forgetfulness of God, must be
   turned into hell. I shall touch briefly upon it, and so close with a
   few words of application. As it is the property of the wicked man to
   forget God, so it must be his portion to be turned, into hell. The
   eviction of this will be easily evident from considering these three
   things only--it is most consonant to the justice of God that thus it
   should be--it is most agreeable to his law: and--it is most serviceable
   to his honour and glory.

   1. The justice of God doth require this; that those persons, who live
   in this world forgetful of God, should at last be turned into hell. If
   God be just he must deal in this manner with a company of rebels; who
   never take notice of him all their days, and shut him out of their
   hearts and thoughts. What! Can the highest God, the eternal Majesty
   suffer such an affront as this from base dirt and earth, and never take
   vengeance? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (Rom. iii. 5.) as
   the apostle speaks in this case. No, undoubtedly. But I cannot stand
   now to insist on particulars.

   2. It is agreeable to his law that God should thus punish the wicked.
   It is one and the self-same law that is a rule of duty to us, and which
   by the divine appointment is a rule of judgment unto him. And this
   righteous law hath determined, that they who thus sin, must be thus
   punished. For this we need go no further than the text itself. "The
   wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God."
   The law of God hath expressly provided in this case; so that if any man
   should now think to put in his exception against this determination of
   God, alas! it must be said to him: "Vain wretch, it is now too late!
   This law was made long ago; before thou wert born, or heard of in the
   world, and ever since the world was. And dost thou think a law shall be
   repealed in a way of favour to a most rebellious wretch, which the
   sovereign eternal God had established before the ages of the world;
   that it might be a fundamental and invariable rule of God's proceedings
   even to the end of it? Alas! it cannot be." God hath decreed many thou
   sand years ago this law; that they who do forget him, shall be turned
   into hell without mercy. And if this be their continual state and frame
   without a change, it must needs be thus with them. There is no
   alteration in this case; for "God is not a man that he should lie, nor
   the son of man that he should repent, (heathen Balaam knew so much of
   God as that came to) hath he said and shall he not do it? or hath he
   spoken, and shall he not make it good?" Numb. xxiii. 19.

   3. And again in the third place, it is most serviceable to his glory
   and honour, that thus it should be; I mean, that those who persist, and
   go on to the last in a forgetfulness of God, should be turned into
   hell. For what glory hath he otherwise of them? "The Lord hath made all
   things for himself; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil." Prov.
   xvi. 4. He will punish them in the day of judgment, because they are
   the most perverse creatures that ever came out of his hands. He hath
   made them for the day of wrath, as the wise man speaks and there is no
   other way for the Lord to have his honour and glory of those persons.
   [109] See to this purpose what is spoken in the words immediately
   before the text; "The Lord is known by the judgment which he
   executeth:" and then it follows, "The wicked shall be turned into hell,
   and all the nations that forget God." And why must this be? Because God
   will never else be known by them. Here they live so many years in the
   world, and God shows himself by his creatures, by his providences, and
   by his ordinances; and they will take no notice of him: they spend away
   their days, and allow God none of their thoughts. "I cannot be regarded
   by these creatures (saith God) they do not regard, nor take notice of
   me. Well! I shall take my leave of them. When they come to be turned
   into hell, and to fall under the pressures of everlasting wrath and
   misery, then they will not forget God; then they will know the God,
   they never knew before; then they will remember him, though now they
   never think of him. Let them now try (saith God) whether they will
   forget me, now that I have them under my wrath and vengeance. While
   they are in this world, they banish me out of their hearts, and
   thoughts: I cannot get one spare thought from them from one day to
   another; but when they come to feel me, and the power of my anger, they
   will then know that, which they would never know before." Thus you see,
   that God's justice, his law, and his glory require, that those wicked
   persons who forget God should be turned into hell.

   V. I shall close all with some few words of application,

   1. We may hence learn, that religion consisting of mere externals will
   never save any man. A person may be a wicked man, and liable to be
   turned into hell, notwithstanding any religion that lies in mere
   outside shew. You see this plainly, that men are liable to be turned
   into hell for their forgetfulness of God. Why, a man may forget God,
   and yet live tinder ordinances, and under the gospel. A man may forget
   God, and yet may be a moral man; and just and righteous in his dealings
   among men. And therefore, it is nothing that lies in mere externals,
   that will either denominate a man religious, or that will save him from
   perishing. A man may go to the utmost extent of all outside religion,
   and yet forget God; be wicked all the while, and so turned into hell at
   last. And therefore, it is a vanity for men to deceive themselves into
   a hope, that all is well with them; and that all shall go well with
   them at last, because they are professors, and enjoy gospel privileges;
   or that because no man can challenge them with fraud, injury, or wrong
   done to their neighbours. It is a vain thing for them to think that
   therefore they are safe, and in no danger. They are all the while
   forgetters of God, and that is enough to bespeak them wicked; let them
   in other respects, be what they will. And therefore you are to know,
   that it is not taking up a profession, or this and that form of
   religion, that will entitle a soul to glory and salvation at last; but
   it must be the having of such a work done upon the heart, as will turn
   the stream of a man's soul towards God, and carry his thoughts and
   affections after him. It is this or nothing, that must make you
   Christians, and save you from hell.

   It is but too common a vanity in these days, wherein we live, for men
   of carnal hearts and corrupt minds; that could never endure to be at
   the pains and expence to wait upon God in the way of his ordinances, in
   order to have their hearts thus changed and turned unto God: it is, I
   say, a common vanity with such persons to think that all their
   business, in order to secure themselves and provide for their own
   safety and welfare, is to take up a certain form of worshipping and
   serving God. Alas! a man may perish, and go to hell, whatever form he
   is of, if he has a carnal heart; a heart that doth not delight in God:
   this will be sufficient to damn a man at last, let him take what
   course, or be of what religion he will. And it is a plain case, it
   speaks an unsound, shifting heart, which cannot endure that such a work
   as this should be done, but slinks away from it. Such are pinching and
   galling ways; and therefore they seek for ease and rest, some other
   way, and for a cheaper method of getting to heaven; as if going into
   such a party would save a man. Why, alas! it will not do it. It must be
   a change wrought upon the heart and soul, that will take it off from
   this world, and pitch it upon God; if we would have an interest in him,
   or live in his blessedness another day. There are those, who are like
   the persons saint Paul speaks of to Timothy. "The time (says he) will
   come, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own
   lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and
   they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned
   unto fables." 2 Tim. iv. 3, 4. Thus it is with many wretched souls in
   the ways of God: while they have been walking in them, it may be they
   have been barren and unfruitful, through their carnal hearts, which
   cannot endure to have any thing done to the purpose; therefore they
   desire to find an easier way than this. They run to other teachers,
   having itching ears; and think of going to heaven upon other terms, by
   only taking up other forms, and changing the way of their religion.
   This speaks a heart to be unsound; as it is a sign of an unsound body,
   that can rest itself in no posture, but lies tumbling and tossing in
   the bed. It hath rest no where; when it hath rolled one way to another,
   it must come back to the same pitch and posture, it was in before. Why,
   the man is not well! alas! the fault is not in the bed, but the body;
   it is because the body is not well, but unsound and unhealthy, that it
   cannot rest. And so men under the ordinances of the gospel dispensation
   cannot find rest to themselves. They cannot indeed find fault with
   them; but they have fleshly carnal hearts, that cannot endure any thing
   should be done to change, and turn them unto God; and therefore they
   seek out new ways, that they may get to heaven in a cheaper, and easier
   manner. And if such souls have a mind to go in those ways, that were
   never known or heard of before, for so many years, they will not find
   what they seek. For, alas! a carnal heart will carry its own pest, and
   trouble about it, wherever it goes: and they will be forced either to
   say at last, the old way of real religion is best; or else they will
   cast off all religion, and there will be the end, as experience in this
   case doth abundantly witness.

   2. As this plainly instructs us, that religion, lying in externals
   only, will never save a man; so it informs us also, that wickedness,
   lying in the heart and thoughts, will abundantly suffice to damn a man.
   And this is no strange doctrine; at least it should not seem to any
   that have ever read the Bible, and know what belongs to true religion.
   Do not you know, that the heart and the thoughts are the prime and
   principal spring of that wickedness that ruins souls and turns them
   into hell for ever? "Out of the heart (says Christ) proceed evil
   thoughts; (Matth. xv. 19.) and these speak a man defiled, make him
   wicked, and turn him into hell at last." Observe also this scripture:
   "O Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be
   saved: how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?" Jerem. iv.
   14. Wickedness and vain thoughts here are parallel expressions, which
   expound one another. That wickedness, of which the prophet speaks,
   consists in the vanity of the thoughts: and those are a man's vainest
   and most wicked thoughts, that run beside God; and have not him for
   their object, nor terminate upon him. Therefore wash thine heart from
   this wickedness, for certainly else there will be no salvation for
   thee. Alas! thou art a damned man, a lost creature, if thine heart be
   not washed from this wickedness of the thoughts. "Repent therefore of
   this thy wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of thine heart
   may be for given thee." Acts viii. 22. In short, to exclude God, out of
   our thoughts, and not to let him have a place there; not to mind, nor
   think upon God; is the greatest wickedness of the thoughts that can be.
   And therefore, though you cannot say of such a one, he will be drunk;
   or he will swear, cozen, or oppress; yet if you can say he will forget
   God, or that he lives all his days, never minding nor thinking upon
   God; you say enough to speak him under wrath, and to turn him into hell
   without remedy.

   3. If they are wicked persons, who do not think of God, and shall for
   that reason be turned into hell, then all thoughts are not free; that
   is, men are not at liberty, as they vainly imagine to dispose of their
   thoughts as they will. Alas! the case is quite otherwise than what many
   poor wretches imagine. They go up and down in the world, never minding
   God from day to day, and they think this is no sin; saying, "Why, what
   is this? It is but the disposing my thoughts; and surely I may do what
   I will with my thoughts. What matter is it what be comes of them?" But
   saith God; "What is there else that I value more, or set a greater
   price upon, than the thoughts and affections of the soul? I must have
   them or nothing. So, be what thou wilt in profession and pretence; yet
   if I be not in thy thoughts, if I be forgotten by thee, I will look
   upon thee as a wicked person, as one that shall be turned into hell."
   Truly, if the case be so, you must learn to correct that foolish
   imagination, that your thoughts are free; or that you may use them as
   you please: and know, that if men will give him no place there, this is
   a desperate, horrid, wickedness, that the great God will be avenged
   upon one day.

   4. Since the case is thus, that wicked men, and all those who forget
   God, shall be turned into hell; we may learn hence, that there are but
   few that shall be saved. Do but weigh the case seriously, and consider
   with yourselves, how few there are that so live, or in the face of
   whose conversations it appears, that their hearts are set upon God!
   whose minds are taken up about him, walking up and down the world from
   morning to night, rejoicing and delighting themselves in God! Oh, how
   few such there are; and consequently how few that are not wicked, and
   shall not be turned into hell at last! My friends, God doth not dally
   with us in such scriptures as these. They are plain words which are
   here spoken, and we may turn off the edge of them from rending and
   cutting our hearts if we will; but one day we shall hear what we are
   told, and read also, that, "The wicked shall be turned into hell, and
   all the nations that forget God." We may therefore easily learn from
   hence, that going to heaven is not so common a thing as most men take
   it to be. Alas! it is not, if the word of God be true. It will be
   found, that going to hell will be much more ordinary among men that
   live under the gospel, than going to heaven. For it is said, they shall
   he turned into hell that forget God. Now, are not these plain words? Do
   they not evince and demonstrate that a great part (alas! the greatest
   part) are hurrying into hell apace? And is it not sad and miserable to
   think, that poor souls should thus spend all their life-time, under a
   gospel of grace? and that so much light and love should shine from
   heaven in vain? It should not be thought of, without pain and agony,
   that men should thus perish; that there should be so few saved from
   hell and destruction, notwithstanding they are under a gospel of light
   and salvation! The truth I am upon is intimated in part of the message
   to the church of Sardis. "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which
   have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white;
   for they are worthy." Rev. iii. 4. Alas! how few are there, how few
   amongst a whole assembly and congregation of people that keep
   themselves from pollution through lusts? How few names are there to be
   found in an assembly, who come under the character of persons that have
   not defiled their garments? or, of those who have numerous thoughts of
   God from day to day? How few are there, that do not come under the
   character in the text, of being forgetters of God; and so of such as
   must be turned into hell? It concerns us all to be serious in thinking
   upon this matter. God hath been serious in revealing this truth to us;
   and his Spirit is poured out for the confirming, establishing, and
   pressing it upon your hearts and spirits, who ever you are; and
   therefore think well of it, and consider seriously how few good men
   there are, who shall finally be saved.

   5. You may hence learn also, that God hath an inspection into, and a
   full knowledge of, the hearts and thoughts of men. This is evident, for
   you see he makes his judgment upon what lies within the inward man; and
   his judgment at last will proceed upon the same ground. "I must have
   those turned into hell (saith the Almighty) who never think of, nor
   remember their God: they must undergo my wrath that have thus forgotten
   me." Now if God's judgments must be thus deter mined upon what is in
   the heart of man, then he knows your hearts; and also what you do with
   your thoughts from day to day. His eye is upon your souls and spirits;
   and sees all the day long which way your affections lie, and which way
   they are carried: and it is by this, he must guide his judgment at the
   last day. Thus says the Psalmist; "He that planteth the ear shall not
   he hear? He that formed the eye shall not he see? He that chastiseth
   the heathen, shall not he correct? He that teacheth man knowledge,
   shall not he know? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are
   vanity." Psal. xciv. 9, 10, 11. He knows well all the vanity of your
   spirits, though you may not observe it. His eyes are observing us all
   the day long, especially on such a day as this; and according to the
   observation he makes, he must judge us at the last day. And therefore
   he must be supposed to have a full, and perfect understanding of all
   things; so as to be able in that day to lay out before a man the
   wickedness of his whole life; to spread before him the vain and wicked,
   the sensual and earthly thoughts, which he was perpetually exercised
   in; and of which his carnal heart was the continual tomb. And this
   cannot be a more difficult than it is a necessary thing to him, who
   must search the hearts, and try the reins, that he may judge
   accordingly at the last day. And then,

   6. And lastly, we may learn hence, that it is not an impossible nor
   difficult thing for wicked men to know themselves to be such; and to
   make a judgment of their own estates Godward. For you see, they have a
   plain rule to judge by; namely, this truth: He that forgets God is a
   wicked man; and he is a wicked man that thus forgets God: and he that
   forgets God must be turned into hell, I pray now do but consider, and
   think with yourselves. Is it so difficult or impossible for a man to
   know, what is the ordinary course of his own thoughts? You may easily
   know if you will, at least the generality of you may know, what the
   current of your thoughts is; and so far make a judgment of your estate
   accordingly. This we must needs acknowledge. For those men who are
   carnal and earthly, their hearts tell them they have not a thought of
   God, from day to day, from week to week, from year to year. Such
   persons cannot be so brutish and absurd, but they may know it, if they
   will, especially if they will take God's word. If not, let them see
   whether they can have any surer rule that cannot deceive. But if they
   will take God's word, they cannot but see that they are those persons
   who are wicked, as they are forgetful of God: and upon that account
   must be turned into hell at last. My friends! if we do not study
   wilfully to ruin ourselves, is it so hard a matter for a man, a
   reasonable man, to sit down at night and consider, "Whither have my
   thoughts been this day? Who hath had my thoughts most? What have I
   taken most pleasure in this day? Is it in God? hath he been so
   delightful and so pleasant, and the remembrance of him in my heart and
   soul, as the pleasures and comforts of this life have been to me? Have
   I taken so much delight to-day in the law of God, as I have in my
   friends, my riches, and my relations? And have I had that fear of God
   in my heart, lest I should sin against him, as I have had about my
   business and affairs, lest they should miscarry?" Is it impossible, I
   say, for a reasonable man thus to consider, from day to day, whither
   hath been the course of his heart and thoughts? And if he find it is
   thus with him; that he lives without having a thought of God, that may
   stay his heart, and ravish his soul; how obvious then is it, that he is
   a wicked wretch! that the wrath of God pursues him! and that he must be
   turned into hell, without remedy, if this continues to be the state and
   condition of his soul! Consider this, and give me leave to close up
   all, with one word of counsel and advice, to such persons as these: and
   may it be acceptable to your hearts!

   (1.) Own your state and condition. If the case be thus, as you see it
   is, that they are wicked persons who forget God, and that such shall be
   turned into hell; why, look into your own hearts, and see whether they
   are not forgetful of God. And when you find that it is thus with you,
   let your judgment pass upon your souls and say; "My wretched and undone
   soul! thou art that soul whom this law condemns; whom this judgment
   convinceth as guilty of this wickedness against God, and liable to his
   vengeance upon this account!" Therefore I say own your estate. It is no
   difficult thing for you to know it. Say then, "1 am the person whom the
   word of God condemns: I am under the curse as a person that has
   forgotten God, and must be turned into hell upon this account, if it
   thus continue with me." But this is not all. I would not leave a soul
   in this case miserably perishing, and despairing of all possibility of
   being saved; but however know that you cannot be saved while it is thus
   with you, and while your hearts are thus framed and turned from God.
   Therefore,

   (2.) Labour forthwith to have the course and stream of your spirits
   turned towards God: otherwise, all your hopes of being saved are quite
   taken away. There is no possibility of your salvation, till your carnal
   earthly hearts be changed. Consider and believe it, there are but these
   two things; either a change of heart, or ruin. And therefore labour, I
   say, to have the course of your thoughts turned about, and directed
   forthwith towards God, without any more delay.

   And in order to this, you must in the first place endeavour to get a
   right and distinct knowledge of God; otherwise you can never think
   rightly of him. Study his word; labour to know what is there discovered
   of his justice, righteousness, holiness, and power; of his goodness,
   and his love. Take in the whole compass of the discovery of God, to
   make up the object of your thoughts; otherwise you do nothing; your
   thoughts will pitch upon some other thing, besides God. If you take in
   but part of the attributes of God, that is not God. It will be some
   idle fancy that you take in, and not God, if your thoughts are not so
   comprehensive as to take in the whole discovery of God in those several
   attributes, by which he makes himself known.

   And then in the next place you must labour to have a work of
   sanctification, and regeneration, wrought upon your own hearts. As
   there must be a right stating of the object, so there must be a right
   framing of the subject too; otherwise it will be to no purpose. If
   there be not a change wrought in the very inward of your souls, so as
   that your hearts be turned towards God; to love, and delight in him,
   with all your soul, and strength; alas! your thoughts of God will not
   be voluntary, but forced: they will never be free, pleasant, and
   delightful. And therefore you must often go to God, and cry to him, and
   say; "Lord, I see my thoughts run from thee! I cannot think of God at
   any time with pleasantness. Sanctify this heart! turn it to thyself!
   else I am lost, and shall be turned into hell." Cry thus unto God
   mightily, and incessantly, till you find such a work done upon your
   souls; for that is the only thing that will procure a freedom, and
   facility of thoughts, towards God: those holy, pleasant and delightful
   thoughts of which a sanctified heart will be a continual spring and
   fountain.

   And to press all this, I will deal plainly with you. If the case be
   thus; if your hearts are not turned, and changed, that you may have
   such thoughts of God as we have been speaking of, there is no avoiding
   the misery threatened in the text; but there must of necessity be an
   expectation shortly of being turned into hell. That must certainly be
   the portion of those persons that forget God. And is that a thing easy
   and tolerable to your thoughts? Ts it easy and tolerable to you to
   think of being sent into that place of torment, without remedy, and
   without hope? merely upon this account, because you would needs live
   without God in the world; and would never have your hearts brought
   towards him? Many deceive themselves with the opinion of a tolerable
   hell; and therefore, such a consideration hath no force upon their
   spirits in the least. But think upon it a little, think what hell is!
   Why, it is that place of torment, that God himself hath ordained for
   the punishment of wickedness and transgression against him. He himself
   is the Author of that state, and of that torment that doth belong unto
   it. It proceeds from almighty power, omnipotent wrath and justice. And
   is that, think you, a tolerable thing? That "Tophet (the hell which the
   text speaks of) is ordained of old--the pile thereof is fire and much
   wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone doth kindle
   it." Isai. xxx. 33. Is this, think you then, a slight matter, for a man
   thus to hurry and throw away his soul? thus to suffer himself to run
   into this hell and destruction, and merely because he would live
   without God; slight, despise, and turn God out of his heart and soul,
   while he is here in the world? Hell is appointed and prepared by God,
   in order to that just revenge that he must take; and will take upon all
   those wicked transgressors, that have their hearts thus hardened, and
   shut up against him. Alas! that is a dreadful thing to think of.
   Revenge! the revenge of a God! that the eternal and almighty God should
   design such a thing, as the avenging of himself in such a way upon
   wicked men! O what heart, that is not made of stone or a rock, can
   choose but tremble? To think, "I shall shortly be subject unto the
   wrath of God, because I have forgotten him, and have lived without him
   in the world; unless my heart be wrought upon, and turned to him as the
   God of my life;" how dreadful is this! Let me then recommend to you, in
   the close, that one scripture, partly touched on before, which is at
   the end of the fiftieth psalm. "Now consider this, ye that forget God,
   lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver." Psal. l. 22.
   What! are those who forget God, wicked persons? must wicked persons be
   turned into hell? is this hell, and is this place appointed for the
   torment of such wretches, by the eternal and almighty God; that he may
   take his revenge upon them, for their slighting and neglecting of him,
   or for what they have done in this world? Why then consider this, all
   ye that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, and there be none to
   deliver you. And so much shall suffice to be spoken to this text.

   [106] Preached at Brixham January 23. l658.

   [107] This passage makes it very probable, that this sermon was
   preached on one of those Fast-days, which were frequently solemnized
   before the restoration, by public authority.

   [108] If any should find this discourse to be too long to be read at
   once, particularly in families, here is a proper resting-place.

   [109] The learned author seems, almost every where, to quote texts of
   Scripture with great propriety, and is generally very happy and
   judicious in his descants upon them; of which all his posthumous
   discourses (as well as those published by himself) are an abundant
   testimony: notwithstanding the liberty he allowed himself, and the
   familiar freedom with which he delivered them, without written notes.
   But the editor is apprehensive, that some may look upon the quotation
   of this passage from Solomon, as an exception. It must be acknowledged,
   that these words have often been made use of in favour of a very
   discouraging doctrine: which, above all others tends to enervate the
   force of all the motives and arguments, that can be made use of, to
   engage persons to attend to the exhortations to a holy and religious
   life. And because some may imagine the author from his comment on the
   passage, understood it in the sense here alluded to; which is evidently
   contrary to the general strain, and tenour of his sentiments, in all
   his writings; it may not be improper to endeavour to set it in its true
   point of light, and to shew in what sense the author may be understood.
   It is very true, the glory of God's justice requires (as the author bad
   observed) that wicked men be punished. For to suppose that God will
   make those happy, who live in a criminal forgetfulness of him, is a
   kind of outraging all his perfections: and no more to be imagined than
   that he will make an innocent being, for instance an angel that never
   fell, eternally miserable out of mere sovereignty and pleasure. Neither
   reason, nor revelation represent the Almighty as so terrible to the
   innocent, or so easy to the guilty. But to assert that wicked men,
   persisting in forgetfulness of God and a course of sin, will be
   punished in the day of wrath; is to assert a very great and awful
   truth, and very probably is all that the author meant by this passage.
   But however, as the learned bishop Patrick observes, the sense of the
   place seems to be this; that God makes use of wicked men, as well as
   all things else, to answer the ends of his providence in this world. As
   for instance; by the ambition of tyrants he inflicts those calamities,
   which he designs upon a wicked nation or people. But the sense after
   all needs not to be so confined. God has made all things for himself;
   or, as the words may be rendered, he has made all things to correspond,
   or answer to each, other: yea even the wicked for the day of evil. That
   is, not only to be his scourge or instrument of bringing calamities
   upon others in this life, but has suited and proportioned the
   punishment of evil men to their deserts; or has settled the connexion
   between vice, and misery in the world to come: just as he has fixed the
   relation of virtue, to future happiness; or, as it is elegantly
   expressed, made righteousness and peace to kiss each other.

ADVERTISEMENT.

   WHEN the Editor first announced a new edition of the Works of the Rev.
   John Howe, he promised one volume, at least, from unpublished
   manuscripts. The sources whence these are derived, are stated in his
   preface to the First Volume. His original intention, was to have
   published the sermons which he obtained from the late Rev. S. Palmer,
   of Hackney, with a selection only of such, from Dr. Williams's library,
   as might appear most worthy of publication. But, on further
   examination, he found these manuscripts to consist chiefly, of a
   regular course of Lectures on "The principles of the oracles of God,"
   which were delivered weekly, and commenced in the year 1690. He
   therefore determined to publish the whole; a determination which he has
   no doubt, the religious public will approve.

   The Author had, doubtless, intended a complete system of Theo logy,
   though the design does not seem to have been carried fully into effect.
   He has, however, continued a regular course, as far as to the
   consideration of "The general and special grace of God in order to the
   recovery of apostate souls." There are, in the whole, seventy Lectures:
   and about fifty Sermons on the most interesting and important subjects.
   Of their authenticity, the Editor is convinced there will be no doubt
   entertained by the public, when they are in formed, that in. addition
   to the evidence derived from their preservation in a public library, as
   the works of Howe, some of the lectures and sermons are in his own hand
   writing, (a facsimile of which will be given,) as appears from
   comparing them with the letters of a correspondence between him and the
   Rev. Mr. Baxter, which are preserved in the library. To those
   acquainted with his former works, the internal evidence of these
   lectures will be conspicuous. The Editor thinks it not too much to say,
   they bear all the marks of Howe's comprehensive, peculiar, and
   extraordinary mind. So strikingly is this the fact, that had he found
   them on a desert he conceives he could not possibly have mistaken their
   "image and superscription."

LECTURE I. [110]

   Heb. v. 12.

   --Ye have need that one teach you again, which be the first principles
   of the oracles of God;--

   MY design is to open unto you the principles of Christian religion, and
   for an introduction hereunto, I have pitched on this passage; without
   any intention to accuse (much less to upbraid) any in particular, with
   ignorance of those principles: but only in the general and indefinitely
   to shew the necessity of their being taught. And considering the matter
   abstractly, without reference to this or that people, or to this or
   that age, whether they be Jewish or Hebrew christians that did need to
   be so taught; or whether they be English or London christians in
   particular; my design is only in general to assert, the necessity of
   being taught such principles; that some time or other they be taught
   and we be instructed in them. And if they have been taught, that they
   be taught again (as the apostle's expression here is) that you be
   taught again, taught over and over, for these are things that we cannot
   too thoroughly have learned, or be too much versed in.

   For the expressions here used,--"the oracles of God" and "the first
   principles" of those oracles--there is not much of obscurity in them.
   The word rendered oracles, doth by universal consent (as well in pagan,
   as christian and sacred writers,) signify divine revelations. It was
   the word among pagans by which it was usual for them to express the
   responses of their gods, or those they took to be such. It generally
   signifies what is divinely revealed, or understood, or taken to be so,
   nor is therefore the addition "of God," needless or useless. Such
   pleonasms are ornative of speech, especially when they render the same
   thing more emphatically so, than if there were not that pleonastical
   addition. And besides, inasmuch as there are many (as the apostle
   speaks) that are called gods, and are worshipped as gods, the oracles
   of God are taken to be from God. And when he saith "the oracles of
   God," (as the article may be well held, and often is to be understood
   emphatically,) it may be understood, the oracles of the God. He that is
   really so called, or to be called, and so it is an expression of
   latitude enough to take in what is of natural revelation, and what is
   of supernatural revelation; for what is of natural revelation is as
   truly from God as the other. All truth is from the first truth, there
   is no beam of light but what proceeds from the Father of lights, in
   whatsoever way it comes.

   And then for the word here rendered principles, that is wont to be
   mentioned in as great latitude as can be supposed: it signifies all
   sorts of principles, whether of nature, or of art, or science
   whatsoever: and whereas, the apostle speaks here (as we render it) of
   the first principles: literally, it is the principles of the beginning,
   and that imports to us, that he did intend those principles in a very
   great latitude, all from first to last that can come under that notion,
   or within that compass. There is a chain or subordination of
   principles, even in principles themselves, as we shall have occasion,
   more hereafter, to take notice of: there are former, and there are
   latter principles. First principles do suppose within this compass,
   that there may be latter and last principles, but plain it is, that the
   apostle doth here intend principles of religion, and chiefly of
   Christian religion, but not solely. That is, principles of Christian
   religion, partly where of it doth consist, and that are peculiar and
   appropriate to it: and partly, such as it doth suppose, such as it doth
   necessarily pre-suppose, that may be common with it, either to the
   Jewish religion while it was to stand, and that still (as being common
   to that religion with Christianity) are to stand; as whatsoever is
   common with the Jewish religion, with Christianity must be perpetual;
   or which is common with natural religion, which we must understand in
   nature to be before Jewish or Christian. And even in time too, as to
   positive instructions, that which was natural did precede the other.

   That therefore which I intend to ground upon this passage, you may take
   briefly thus--That there are principles of religion that need to be
   taught--And in pursuance of this I shall here,

   I. Say somewhat more generally of these principles.

   II. Shew the necessity of their being taught.

   III. Speak something of the way of teaching them: and then

   IV. Make application.

   I Of these principles themselves: I shall shew there are such--and what
   they are--and of what kind.

   1. That there are such, is a thing without all doubt. There is nothing,
   no created thing but hath its principles: principles of being there are
   belonging to it. Every complete substance that exists in the world, and
   is a created one, must be supposed to have such principles; and hath
   such generative and effective principles, and constructive principles:
   the principles from which it did proceed, and the principles of which
   it doth exist. There are also principles of knowledge as well as being.
   There is no piece of knowledge, no sort of science, but hath its
   principles as you all know. And therefore religion, Christian religion,
   theology, Christian theology must have it's principles too. It is a
   science, a practical one and of most absolute and universal necessity,
   and its principles must therefore be supposed of the most absolute and
   universal necessity too. Every piece of knowledge is not every one's
   business; but this is every one's business, to know God, to know how he
   may be saved, how it may be well with him to eternity.

   2. But what are these principles? It is my present business to tell you
   of what sort they are. What they are particularly, that we must do by
   degrees as we come to them. Now you may judge of what sort they are by
   what the apostle mentioneth in this context; and by the reference this
   passage, in the beginning of the 6th chapter, hath to that we are upon,
   we must suppose him to be still speaking of the first principles of the
   oracles of God. It may be thought strange that he should mention here
   things so small in their own nature as baptisms (not baptism but
   baptisms) and the laying on of hands, as if they were to come into the
   number of the first principles: not of principles only, but of the
   first principles.

   To this I shall only say, I cannot think that was at all meant by the
   apostle, that they should be so taken for any of those principles. You
   are to consider to whom the apostle writes this epistle, namely to the
   Jews. These two, baptisms and the laying on of hands were anciently and
   (as we know) originally Jewish rites, transferred into the Christian
   church afterwards. And so the meaning of the apostle is only this; "I
   will not stand to lay again the foundation of repentance from dead
   works, and of faith towards God, especially not to you who have been
   instructed in these things all along so distinctly, they being nothing
   else but the doctrine of baptisms, and the laying on of hands;" and
   then goes on to the other two: that baptisms and laying on of hands did
   continually instruct them (as usages that did obtain among themselves)
   as to repentance from dead works and faith towards God, as it is here
   expressed. And so these words are very fitly to be rendered by way of
   parenthetical opposition to those that do immediately go before, that
   is, "not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and
   faith towards God, (being the doctrines of baptisms and laying on of
   hands, or the things which baptisms and the laying on of hands,
   heretofore so frequently used among you, did signify) or the
   resurrection of the dead or of eternal judgment." So there are but four
   mentioned of the first principles of the oracles of God. Against this
   way of reading this passage I meet but with one objection, and that is,
   the want of the greek article, before doctrine here, but that is so
   little an objection, if we consider how many greater ellipsis there
   are, that are frequent in Scripture, that it seems too light to be put
   into the balance against the weighty reason that is to be given for the
   other reading.

   But it may be said then, What! Are there but four principles, as such,
   which have reference to the whole business of Christianity, which the
   apostle's discourse here must have final and determinate reference
   unto? "Repentance from dead works, faith towards God, the resurrection
   of the dead, and eternal judgment;" are there no more than these?

   Yes undoubtedly there are, but it was none of the apostle's design to
   give an enumeration of those principles, but to give an instance of
   such as he did not now intend to insist upon, but to wave and pass by.
   He only tells us this was not his principal business and design to
   deliver such principles, and he tells at the same time, what he thought
   fit to wave, while his discourse is moving forward to the information
   he would give them concerning the Melchesidekian priesthood of Christ:
   to which (after some warm discourse in the greater part of the 5th
   chapter) he comes in the close of that, and pursues in the seventh
   chapter.

   3. But that I may shew more distinctly what kind of principles the
   apostle here hath reference to, take these considerations:

   (1.) It is plain that they must be meant of doctrinal principles,
   principles of doctrine that are to be received into the mind and
   understanding. There are those that are doctrinal, and there are those
   that are practical principles. It is true indeed, all principles of the
   Christian religion are remotely practical, because the main end of
   Christianity is practice. But the difference between a doctrinal
   principle and a practical, lies here, that supposing a doctrinal
   principle to have reference to practice, to serve towards it at a
   distance, yet a practical principle is that from which action doth
   immediately proceed. As now, if we speak to the very heads themselves
   that the apostle speaks of, "repentance from dead works, and faith
   towards God," the doctrine concerning these makes one sort of
   principle, and the habit another; the habit of faith, and the habit of
   repentance, that is a principle in the soul from which the acts of
   these immediately proceed. But the more essential doctrine concerning
   both these, must make the doctrinal principle concerning them; as there
   may be doctrinal principles about the most practical things, and those
   are the doctrinal principles, as such, that are here intended and which
   are to be the matter of teaching: which are to be taught, as the
   apostle speaks. It is very true that the papists do very industriously
   make it their business to overthrow that distinction of fundamental and
   extra-fundamental doctrines; of those that are essential and those that
   are extra-essential; such as are of absolute necessity, and such as are
   not necessary, or not so necessary. And they mightily insist and urge
   to have a catalogue particularly of those which we would have to go
   under the notion of fundamentals: because they think they could cavil
   and contend about any such catalogue that should be given, and look
   upon it as impossible there should be any so unexceptionably given,
   that nothing should be said against it, why this, or that, is taken in,
   or why such and such things should be left out. Therefore they would
   conclude there ought to be no such distinction; which is the most
   absurd thing that can be imagined] for to take away the distinction of
   fundamental and extra-fundamental is to suppose one of these two
   things. Either it must suppose that there is nothing necessary in
   Christian religion, which is a very strange supposition that there
   should be any such religion wherein nothing should be necessary; or it
   must suppose all things equally necessary, all necessary alike: and so
   that it were equally necessary that we know Salathiel to be the son of
   Neri, as to know that Jesus is the Son of God. But there needs no more
   to be said at present to this, than that whatsoever is necessary in
   point of doctrine to the soul's acting of "repentance from dead works,
   and faith towards God", (for the two things that follow are no matter
   of our exercise. The raising of the dead and the eternal judgment are
   no part of our duty; but our duty is summed up in these two, repentance
   and faith!) whatsoever, I say, is necessary in point of doctrine to the
   soul's being exercised in one or other of these with the understanding
   and judgment of a reasonable creature, so much is necessary to make a
   doctrinal principle: whatever leads the soul into the exercise of
   repentance and faith, so much must be necessary under the head of
   doctrinal principles concerning our duty. It is true we must know the
   other things too as motives to it, but these are to have the immediate
   influence upon things to be done. And I might more shortly say,
   whatever is necessary to bring the soul into union with God through
   Christ, all that knowledge that is necessarily antecedent to this, so
   much comes within the compass of what is fundamental in our religion,
   and indeed nothing comes within that compass but what is one way or
   other reducible to this, that must not one way or other have influence
   upon repentance and faith. And I add,

   (2.) That as concerning these, some may be more deeply fundamental than
   others are, even of those that are of equal necessity. That is, there
   are principles that in reference to things depending on them have that
   notion of principles and are to be so considered, that yet may be
   consequential to other things on which they do depend. As in the
   building of a house (which is the metaphor the apostle, in this
   context, makes use of) there may be some parts that may be both
   fundamental to what is upon them, and superstructive in reference to
   what lies under them. And,

   (3.) These principles may be partly of natural and partly of
   supernatural revelation. Of natural, that there is a God. Of
   supernatural, that Jesus is the Son of God. Though what is of natural
   revelation doth not comprehend what is of supernatural, yet all that is
   of supernatural takes in and includes all that is natural too. The same
   thing may be supernaturally revealed, and naturally; as the same
   conclusion may be both believed and known. And again,

   (4.) They are generally the plainest things that are to go for such
   principles. God hath so graciously ordered it, that that which is most
   necessary should be most plain. Indeed some may object themselves here,
   the doctrine of the Trinity, but as concerning that, I hope when we
   come to it, it will appear that what God hath said about that is very
   plain; though what men have said and devised about it, is obscure and
   intricate enough, even what they mean for the explication of it. And I
   only add this, for the present, concerning these principles,

   (5.) They must be supposed to be but few. The first principles, or the
   great principles of religion, do lie in a very little compass: as that
   which goes amongst us in the name of the apostles' creed (you know) is
   very short. And (if antiquity deceive us not) was much shorter than it
   is. Though it is true that the variety of apprehensions and sentiments,
   and the great dissentions and manifold errors, that have in after-times
   sprung up in the Christian church have occasioned the enlargements of
   creeds and multiplying of articles of faith; varying them this way or
   that, to meet with this or that wrong sentiment as they have been
   apprehended; yet the things that are in themselves necessary, must
   needs be but few. And if the Christian religion ever return to itself,
   and be what at first it was, simple, pure, plain, and unmixed,
   undoubtedly the sum and substance of it will be found to lie in very
   little compass. It hath sadly degenerated in point of efficacy, and
   vigour, and power, as it hath been increased and augmented in point of
   necessary doctrines: men rendering such doctrines necessary, or
   bestowing that notion upon them arbitrarily as they have thought fit.
   And indeed the state of Christian religion hath never been flourishing
   since (as one very accurately observes in the last age) it became Res
   Ingeniosa fore Christianum: a thing of wit to be a christian. So much
   at present for the kinds and sorts of these principles. But now,

   II. For the necessity of their being taught; as to that, little needs
   to be said.

   1. That the things themselves are necessary is out of question. If any
   religion be necessary, it's principles must be much more so, especially
   if first principles. And

   2. This doth plainly infer therefore the necessity of their being
   taught: else how should we come by them? And though there is somewhat
   pre-supposed to our religion that is natural, it is but pre-supposed as
   fundamental to all that was necessary to be super-added, for there is
   not enough within the compass of nature to lead men to blessedness, if
   there be not great superadditions. And what we have not by nature, how
   should we come by it, if we are not taught it? if we do not learn it?
   We read of great promises in Scripture of being taught of God. "Every
   one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me," as it is
   in that, John vi. 45. quoted from the prophet Isaiah liv. 13. "Thy
   children shall be all taught of the Lord." And "It is written in the
   prophets, they shall be taught of God:" and then it followeth, "Every
   one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me." And so
   we read, Jeremiah xxxi. 34. as that which is foretold to be the great
   blessing of a time then future (and for ought I see, yet future) that
   there should be no saying "Know the Lord." They should not need to
   teach one another saying, "Know the Lord: for they shall all know me
   from the least to the greatest:" quoted by the apostle Heb. viii. 11.
   But even such teaching is teaching still. He is the great Teacher: and
   whole acheth like him? But as to subordinate teaching or human teaching
   there is nothing in all these promises that can exclude it. And when it
   is said "They shall all be taught of God:" and that they shall not need
   any to teach them, the meaning is, that there shall be a greater
   inclination in men's spirits to learn. Not that they shall know it
   without teaching, but that an aptitude to learn, shall be given them
   more generally than had been given, and (so far as we can observe) than
   is yet given. Men shall not need to be urged and pressed to know the
   Lord. No, there shall be a greater promptitude in men's minds to learn,
   and to use, and improve the means of knowing him, than had been before.
   But that there shall always, to the end of time, be use of human
   teaching, our Lord's own words just before his ascension plainly enough
   speak. Mat. xxviii. and the close: "I am with you to the end of the
   world." In this work it must be, "to assist you in this teaching
   through all successions of time, to the very end of the world." But if
   there should be any such time or state of things on earth, wherein men
   should no way at all need to be taught the knowledge of God,
   supervening and coming; that is not yet come, we are sure we see no
   such time: and if any such time should come, and we should see it, I
   verily believe there are none of those that now are intent upon the
   business of teaching, but would be glad in those times to resign their
   office. And in the mean time nothing is plainer than so it is, and
   indeed nothing is plainer than so it will be to the end of the world;
   that there is and will be need and use of human subordinate teachers,
   to teach and instruct men in the principles, even the first principles
   of faith in Christ. But,

   III. I would say somewhat concerning the way of this teaching. And
   there be several ways about which we might distinguish and speak to you
   in distinct heads: there is private teaching and public teaching; and
   teaching from house to house, and teaching in public assemblies: there
   is teaching by continued discourse, and teaching in a way of
   interlocution, by way of question and answer, that to which the name of
   catechising is now generally appropriated, though indeed without ground
   from the word itself, or the proper significancy of the word. And this
   is indeed, in the account of many, a very formidable and frightful
   work, the work of catechising. I do not know why it should be so
   formidable a thing for one person to converse with another, to put
   questions and return answers; for is not this the usual way of common
   conversation? And why should it be more formidable to us to converse
   thus about the things of God, than about other things, that we count
   necessary, and about many things that we cannot so much as count so?
   But there can be surely nothing more necessary than religion and the
   things that concern it. I am for my part very far from that imperious
   and terrifying way of managing such a work as this, to affright people
   and make them afraid of it. And indeed were I engaged in such work, I
   should as leave they should catechise me as I them, if questions could
   be so judiciously put as to draw forth a full explication of the matter
   proposed. It would be all one to me, who were the questionist and who
   the answerer, supposing the question be aptly put so as to draw forth
   the explication most fully. I should like well it should be said, Pray
   how is such a thing understood, or what help may be given to understand
   that point more distinctly and more clearly?

   And some considerations I shall give you, at present, about this way of
   teaching by familiar interlocution; and which indeed the exigency of
   the case doth require to be in a public assembly, where many meet and
   are convened together for that very purpose and upon that account. I
   would not insist upon the word, though it is a very significant word,
   that serves the purpose for which it is used well enough, but we find
   divers pas sages in Scripture where this word is used that fully refers
   to that way of teaching. And

   1. Let that be considered, Gal. vi. 6. "Let him that is taught in the
   word, communicate to him that teacheth." The word there is catechised.
   Let him that is catechised in the word communicate to him that
   catechiseth: this implies it to be a stated business, that there must
   be continued catechising, and being catechised. The apostle, in 1 Cor.
   xiv. 19. useth the same word when he tells us "I had rather speak five
   words with my understanding, that by my voice I may teach others also,
   (the word is catechised and he speaks of doing it in the church) than
   ten thousand words in an unknown tongue."

   2. That though another sort of word be used in that other language,
   when Abraham is so highly commended for instructing his household, (in
   Genesis xviii.) yet we are to consider what his household was, an
   household out of which he could draw forth (as we find upon occasion)
   three hundred fighting men. How vastly numerous must that family be?
   And when they met together for the worship of God, that must be a
   greater assembly than our's usually are: and his instructing was so
   that they should be all brought to know God and the principles of
   religion; which must be supposed and (as the thing speaks) must mostly
   be when he had them together, though there might be occasion for
   private instruction and admonition too.

   3. There ought certainly to be a very great deference given to usages
   in the Christian church in the purer and primitive times of it, when
   Christianity was most of all itself; and we find very ancient records,
   even of teaching by this way of interlocution, and in public too.
   Origen lived very early, and it is matter notorious that he was eminent
   under the notion of a catechist in his time, whose business it was to
   teach and instruct in a catechetical way, and we are informed of divers
   catechists that they had in the church of Alexandria at the same time,
   that being, it is true, a numerous, great church, and requiring the
   help of many to that purpose. And all along, in the best times of the
   Christian church, (before popery was born into it) we find hereupon
   that there were these two distinct orders of Christians, the
   catechumini and the fidelos: those that were catechetically instructed
   and those that having been for a competent time so instructed, were
   found fit to be admitted into full communion: and hereupon there were
   particular places appointed them in the assemblies, wherein they were
   to stand apart by themselves in a sort of inclosure, but in the view of
   the jest of the assembly. And the nature of the thing doth speak, that
   there must always be these two orders within the compass of the
   Christian church, those that are under instruction are catechumini, and
   those that as they are fit, are taken out of them and received into
   full communion. A thing that nature and common prudence will so much
   dictate, that long before the Christian name was ever heard of in the
   world, we read that Pythagoras's school had the same orders, where the
   business was principally to teach and instruct in virtue. There were
   those that were Extra-syndonem and those that were Intra-syndonem;
   there was a septum or inclosure that did receive those that were looked
   upon to be thoroughly virtuous. His school indeed was like a church,
   upon that account, and commonly there were kept seven years expectants
   without the inclosure, not to be received (as it were) into full
   communion till they were very well confirmed in virtue and goodness.
   And thereupon, if any of those that had been received within the in
   closure should afterwards degenerate and be guilty of any crimes, there
   was as solemn an excommunication of them as we read of any among
   Christians, and a funeral besides held for such a person; that is, a
   coffin was brought into the auditorium and lamentation made over it as
   over one dead, dead from among them; and so such were to be humbled
   that way and wrought upon. And there can be no such thing as the
   continuance of Christianity in the world, on other terms than that
   there must be two such orders. And I add,

   4. That it is very apparent that our Saviour's way of teaching when he
   was here on earth was very much in a way of interlocution, and that
   often in great public assemblies, as it is obvious for yourselves to
   take notice in evangelical history. And,

   5. That Christians generally are under an express charge to be ready to
   give an account of the reason of their hope and faith, to any one that
   shall ask it, with meekness and fear: as in that, 1 Pet. iii. 15. And
   if they were to do it (as that direction hath more especial reference)
   even to enemies, to persecutors, and when it was to cost them their
   lives, much more to instructors and teachers, when they desire it, only
   in order to their own help and to the promoting and furtherance of
   knowledge among men. And,

   6. It is very plain that they who by office are to make it their work
   and business to instruct others, are obliged to use all the most apt
   and likely means that may be most profitable and most conducing to that
   end and purpose. How solemn a charge is that the apostle lays on
   Timothy! 2 Tim. iv. 1, 2. "I charge thee, therefore, before God and the
   Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his
   appearing and his kingdom; preach the word, be instant in season, and
   out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and
   doctrine." With all doctrine, (as it is refer red undoubtedly to both
   the things that go before and that follow the long-suffering) must in
   all reason intend, not merely the matter of doctrine, but the manner
   also, for there may be matters of doctrine materially to be considered,
   that are not so necessary to be so very much inculcated and urged. But
   that same all-doctrine is every way a teaching that is likely, or by
   which it may be more probable that good may be done; and if there be
   such an obligation upon teachers, there is a correspondent obligation
   upon hearers to attend thereto: yea, and that not only implied, but
   expressly required: "Obey them that have the rule over you." Heb. xiii.
   17. Hereupon no doubt they are obliged to comply with, and to concur
   to, set on foot all such means and methods of instruction as may be
   most conducible to this end. And that this is a means proper to this
   end may be manifest upon several considerations. As,

   (1.) That it most evidently tends to engage the minds of them that are
   immediately dealt with in this way, to be intent on the matter in hand,
   as when a question is put to me I am bound under a kind of necessity to
   consider it, that I may know how to make one answer or another as it is
   particularly and personally directed to me. There are many things that
   pass us by in a continued and transient discourse, that a wandering
   mind takes little notice of, gives little heed to; but when it is
   called by a particular question to this particular point, it cannot but
   make the mind intent upon it. As when the apostle, in the midst of his
   apologetical discourse before king Agrippa, applied particularly to him
   with that question, "King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?" the
   king thought himself obliged to consider his question, and you see what
   kind of answer he gives, so as he never else would have thought, if
   that question had not been directed to himself. Such an impression did
   that question make on his mind.

   (2.) It tends manifestly very much to engage the attention of all that
   hear, at such an exercise as that we are now speaking of. Every body
   presently gives his ear when there is a question put, "Come what will
   be answered to this question?" and if it need explication," What will
   be said in this case?" It makes men exert their minds, and engage their
   spirits a great deal more, as every one's reason and experience must
   tell him.

   (3.) It tends very much to fix things and make them continue with those
   that hear and do attend on such a kind of exercise, for that very
   reason, because it hath set the animadversive faculties so much the
   more on work; and if the matter be considered, nothing is plainer, than
   that people do many times blame their memories very causlessly, when it
   is really the animadversive faculty is not used; for things that once
   are earnestly attended to are much more likely to be remembered, but
   people find fault with their memories because they do not mind what
   they hear at first. If they earnestly minded what they heard, and
   considered things, and took them to heart, it would contribute a great
   deal towards the fixing of them in their memories, towards their
   retention of them. I believe, for the much greater part, when the
   badness of the memory is complained of, the fault lies elsewhere, that
   they did not seriously attend at the first, for things will be retained
   longer that have been well considered at first.

   (4.) Hereupon, through the blessing of God, much more may be done
   towards the conversion of souls by the gospel dispensation, when the
   things needful to be understood in order hereto, are well understood
   for it; for while they are not so, we speak in the dark and people hear
   in the dark, and what we say to them hath an uncertain sound, as the
   apostle speaks. 1 Cor. xiv. 17. They cannot tell what we mean when we
   speak of the weightiest and most important things belonging to the
   kingdom of God, but if such things be well understood at first (as it
   is to be hoped they will be in this way) then there is one great step
   made, one main difficulty is got over: and so it obtains in discourses
   that have more directly that design, to make men intend this business,
   and impress things upon men's hearts to the utmost, which had passed
   through their minds before or were received clearly and distinctly
   there before. Again

   (5.) It is likewise, by consequence, likely to be the means of
   introducing a much more fruitful Christianity among us, for
   undoubtedly, religion is more lively by how much the more it is well
   grounded: they that do believe this or that doctrine without a ground,
   they commonly believe it too without fruit. If it have not a good
   ground it is proportionably inefficacious, and a languid thing; as seed
   that is sown and hath no depth of earth, (as our Saviour speaks) brings
   not forth fruit unto perfection. Therefore is that charge given unto
   the Colossian Christians: "As ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord so
   walk ye in him." Col. ii. 6. One notion under which we are said to
   receive him is as a teacher, and to receive him (though that be not
   all) is to receive his truths, his doctrines. "As ye have received
   Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built, up in him, and
   established in the faith as ye have been taught, abounding therein with
   thanksgiving." And therefore, so rationally doth the apostle pray for
   them in that chapter, that they might be "fruitful in every good work,
   increasing in the knowledge of God." And in 1 Phil. ix. 10, 11. those
   Christians are there prayed for after the same method, that they might
   abound in judgment and in all knowledge, (that they might become
   knowing and judicious Christians) and then, that they might abound in
   all the fruits of righteousness that would be through Christ, to the
   praise and glory of God. And,

   (6.) This would be a very great and likely means to bring Christians
   generally to a great deal more of seriousness in the temper of their
   minds and spirits, that is, to exclude and shut out vanity,
   replenishing their minds with great and weighty things, things that
   deeply concern them: for in this way, undoubtedly, such things would
   come to be more inwrought into their hearts and to have a more settled
   abode and residence there. Then it would be as ordinary a thing when
   Christians did meet, to catechise one another about the things of God
   and about the eternal kingdom (if I may use that phrase) as to
   catechise one another about news, or about the state of the times: what
   is doing now in the country, or in the court, or in this or in any
   other nation or kingdom: the kingdom of heaven surely would look as
   great as any earthly kingdom or country, or greater, if we were more
   taken up about the things that relate thereunto. And so might the
   ancient Christianity come to be restored in some measure among us,
   wherein (as antiquity tells us) it was so ordinary a thing when
   Christians did meet, presently to fall upon the matters of their
   religion: and it was usual in their families, even all the day long,
   when people were about their affairs either in the shop or at the
   distaff, to mention the great things of the Christian religion, from
   morning to night mingling discourses of that kind with all their
   affairs, as they could admit of their being mingled. This was primitive
   Christianity, and it was in these early days that this course that I
   now speak of did obtain, even when such familiar interlocutions for the
   instruction of candidates to Christianity were carried on in their
   assemblies. And,

   (7.) It were much to be hoped that by this means, that faulty shyness
   would be overcome which doth appear too generally of discoursing at all
   about the things of God and the matters of religion, and what men find
   in their own spirits of savour and impression of such things. It is
   very strange and unaccountable that there should be so peculiar a
   shyness in reference to the matters of religion, to take discourse of
   them, especially as to one's own sentiments about them, what one
   apprehends and what one feels in himself, in one's own breast. There is
   not such a shyness in reference to things of any other concerns
   besides, as there is in reference to those concernments that relate to
   men's souls and their state Godward and for eternity. Nobody is shy to
   speak of his own or other's ails, for the most part, nobody is shy to
   speak of an aching head, or an aching tooth: but what a shyness is
   there to speak of spiritual maladies, a bad heart, a blind mind, and
   the like? If discourses were in this way more frequently introduced, so
   as to become familiar, this shyness would be gradually overcome. We
   find in public assemblies it is usual to give an account of things that
   are of another concernment, of a most inferior concernment; as in
   courts of judicature, where persons of the meanest capacity are called
   frequently to speak their knowledge, to tell what they know about such
   and such a matter that doth concern meum and tuum, this or that man's
   right; or concerning a question depending between the government and
   any particular person concerning a criminal matter. Nothing more
   ordinary than to have persons catechised about such things as these in
   public assemblies, and it is not thought strange. And why should there
   be a particular shyness, strangeness, and aversion to give an account
   of things relating to the kingdom of God? As if it were a criminal
   thing to have one's mind engaged and taken up about matters of that
   nature, or as if persons were afraid to be thought guilty of religion,
   as if it were a dreadful thing, a thing to be dreaded, to be thought
   guilty of minding God, and the concernments of another world. And

   (8.) It would surely be a very likely means to prevent apostacy,
   especially in a difficult and trying time: indeed there is continual
   danger of apostacy: there is much danger from daily conversation with
   this world, there is much danger especially in a prosperous state and
   condition in it, least there should be heart apostacy, a heart secretly
   departing from the love of God. And there is great danger in times of
   persecution for religion's sake, for Christ's sake, and for the
   gospel's sake. But there is nothing (in point of means and in
   subordination to the grace and Spirit of Christ) likely to be a better
   security against it, than in such a way as this, to be once thoroughly
   instructed in the great "principles of the oracles of God." to have
   them well inlaid. They that are so instructed at first are not like to
   be as "children, tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine," or
   entangled by the cunning craftiness of them that lie in wait to
   deceive. Some are withdrawn by seduction, some by persecution: there
   will be the same fence against both in such a way us this. "Nay," will
   such a one say "I have (through the goodness of God) understood the
   grounds of my religion well: I did not trifle when I took up this
   profession;" as the apostle speaks concerning his trust in God, "I know
   whom I have believed and I am persuaded he is able to keep that which I
   have committed unto him until that day." So for a christian to say, "I
   know what I have believed, and I mean to abide by it through the grace
   of God," this will preserve him under suffering. It is a very
   uncomfortable thing in point of suffering to be called to suffer for
   that I never understood and which I never savoured or relished. To
   suffer for what I never had any clear understanding of, and to suffer
   for what I never had any taste or relish of in my own soul, though it
   is possible to suffer upon such an account, yet it is uncomfortable. A
   man may "give his body to be burned" without love, but it is very
   uncomfortable so to suffer. And the one of these things is the way to
   the other; I am likely to savour what I understand in those things that
   have a real bottom and are in themselves substantial. There are some
   things indeed that have so little in them, that the more I understand
   them the less I shall mind them; the more I understand them the more I
   shall despise them, but it is not so in the great things of God and
   that do relate to his kingdom. And,

   (9.) It is that which will certainly be a great ornament to the
   Christian church, and an honour to it, when there is a succession
   coming up, a rising generation of them that do under stand themselves
   and appear to do so, make it evident that they do understand themselves
   in the great things of religion; that they receive them and take them
   in. As it was the reproach of the Christian church (as it was still
   called) when that barbarous age was upon it, and so great and gross
   darkness and ignorance did cover the face of it, so will the contrary
   be it's honour. And when times of greater knowledge do come, then in
   one sense (though these words have more meaning than that) it may be
   said to Zion "Arise, shine; for thy light is come; and the glory of the
   Lord is risen upon thee." Isaiah lx. 1. Light signifies holiness too,
   and a prosperous state, but it signifies knowledge as that which is
   inchoative of all the rest. And,

   (10.) Lastly. It is one of the most comfortable presages that can be,
   when once the spirits of those that are to be learners (as it were) in
   the school of Christ, come to be engaged and intent upon getting in the
   knowledge of Christ, and have their souls impressed thereunto. I say it
   is one of the most comfortable presages of the approach of that time
   and that season drawing on, when one shall say to another, and even
   people to people, "Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
   and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will shew us of his ways,
   and we will walk in his paths." Micah iv. 2. It is a comfortable
   pre-signification of the approach of that time when "many shall run to
   and fro, and knowledge shall be increased:" when there shall be very
   much of inquiry and concern to know God and the things of God, then the
   time will be drawing on, when the knowledge of the Lord shall abound
   and cover the earth as the waters cover the seas. Isaiah xi. 9.

   IV. But to make some brief use of all this. There are principles of
   religion, or of the oracles of God, which are needful to be taught.
   Then here,

   1. Let us consider and adore the goodness of God towards a wicked and
   apostate world. How strange a sound should such a word carry with it to
   us. "The oracles of God!" How transporting a sound, for the oracles of
   God to be mentioned and spoken in such a world as ours is! when it
   would be thought that it's so universal revolt from God, should
   everlastingly have cut off all intercourse between him and it, that he
   should never have regard for this world any more; not more than for the
   angels that fell and kept not their first station. Do we hear of any
   oracles of God sent down into those infernal regions? Oh! how great
   thing then is it, that there should be among us the oracles of God!
   Indeed it argues very great stupidity, if there be not a mighty sense
   of this upon our spirits. Pagans have had the most grateful sense that
   could be imagined but of a mock pretence hereunto, the very notion of
   oracles carries a sacredness and venerableness in it; any thing that is
   divine, any thing that is of heavenly descent, and so such things,
   though but feignedly such-, have been reckoned of among pagans. Oh!
   what veneration had those poor Ephesian idolaters for that thing (we
   read it image, but there is no such thing in the greek) that dropped
   down from Jupiter, how mighty a zeal was there among that people, so as
   that the city, is said to be a whole neochoron; "All Ephesus is a
   worshipper;" so it is expressed, as if that mighty city were but one
   worshipper of the great goddess Diana. So great was their zeal, so high
   their veneration for a thing that their deluding priests made them
   believe dropped down from heaven. And we know how high their value was,
   of how much they did magnify themselves for the diabolical oracles they
   had among them in former days before Christ's time; and how mighty a
   concern there was among them when these were silent at his coming. So
   as that some of their wisest men (Plutarch for instance) was fain to
   write discourse upon discourse to qualify their minds thereupon. Two
   treatises we read of, written by that author, one why they ceased,
   which he wrote in verse: the other why they did so totally cease as
   upon the matter they did.

   And when the privilege of having the oracles of God, was a more
   confined and limited thing, Oh! how did the Jews (to whom they were so
   great a treasure) magnify themselves upon them, how did they glory in
   it! And it was acknowledged that they had a mighty advantage, "What
   advantage had the Jews? Much every way, chiefly as that to them were
   committed the oracles of God," Rom. iii. beginning. Oh! we do not
   enough consider the kindness of heaven towards our world! that there
   should be any beams of divine light (whether by natural or
   super-natural revelation) shining in it. We do not enough consider that
   we are quite cut off from God. He doth hereby shew he hath yet a desire
   to the work of his own hands, in that he will have his oracles known to
   men upon earth; as elsewhere it is said of his tabernacle: "the
   tabernacles of God are with men;" and in what a transport doth Solomon
   break forth (l Kings 8.) in that seraphical triumph of joy: "Will God
   indeed dwell upon earth?" Oh! that there should be any abode of the
   divine presence upon earth; and these arc some of the most expressive
   tokens of such a visible presence vouchsafed; his placing these oracles
   among us and diffusing the most impressive light that reveals him, and
   that reveals the great things that relate to his kingdom. And,

   2. We may collect hence, that it is a very apt method and accommodated
   unto intelligent creatures, that God doth make use of, in conveying to
   them the necessary knowledge of the doctrine of Christ; for there are
   principles that are to be begun with; (first principles as you see) you
   had need to be taught which are the first principles of the oracles of
   God. There are .the oracles of God, there are principles of these
   oracles, and the first of those principles. God doth apply himself to
   us suitable to our nature, he aims to draw us by the "cords of a man
   and by the bands of love," to make reason and love, engineers by which
   he would take hold of us, sanctify the one principle and the other,
   that we may be brought nigh to him and held in with him.

   And it ought deeply to be considered that there are (as you see)
   principles wherewith we are to begin, and by which we are to be led on
   (as the apostle's expression here is) towards perfection. Principles of
   truth, principles of doctrine, such as a "form of sound words,"
   wholesome words may be expressive of. Though (by the way) I am against
   being tied to a form of words; in matters of this nature I would have
   words used for helps, not for bonds. And if I were to inquire how any
   have profited in the things of God, even in this very respect; in
   respect of their knowledge relating thereto, if they could express a
   sound and good understanding about these things, in their own words, in
   words of their own choosing, and not which they found in this or that
   book, I should like it a great deal better. It would argue them so much
   the more understanding and knowing christians, and likely to prove more
   stable ones. As I said before, I would have you to make use of other
   men's words (as you may any good book you read or sermon you hear) for
   helps but not for bonds; to help your understandings, not to limit
   them. Again,

   3. This lets us see the presumptuous and preposterous rashness of such
   persons as do at random, at all adventures take up the Christian
   profession, when they never as yet understood the principles of
   Christianity, and so they really profess they know not what: as if the
   name christian were a name of nothing, a name that had no
   signification, a name that did import no real thing. Those that can
   give no account of their knowledge of principles, and yet will be
   christians, call themselves christians, what an usurpation is this! How
   groundlessly and presumptuously do they usurp a glorious name! a title
   that carries with it a great deal of glory! and I would have you
   understand it so. A christian is a glorious title, and they will be
   made to understand it to be so another day, who have usurped it they
   know not why, who have prophaned it, and could never justify the
   pretence. It is a far greater presumption than for any man to call
   himself king or emperor, who is a mean peasant, an ordinary fellow and
   can have no such pretence. "I will bring them to worship at thy feet
   (it is spoken to the Philadelphian church Rev. iii. 9.) who say they
   are Jews and are not, but do lie." For a man to take up a profession
   that is a mere lie, what a presumption is it! a man to call himself a
   christian! but he lies, and must do so upon one account, if he live in
   the continual violation of the Christian precepts, and upon another, if
   he understand nothing of the Christian principles. It is a lie: it is
   to suppose that christian is a name without a meaning, a name that
   means nothing. And,

   4. We may collect hence, that it is very stupid folly for men to live
   all their days under this profession, without ever concerning
   themselves to understand the principles of Christianity. It is very
   presumptuous rashness to take up that profession, when a man will
   commence Christian all of a sudden without ever having understood its
   principles. But it is far more stupid folly if a man will all his days,
   live under the Christian profession in continued ignorance of the
   principles of the Christian religion. How ridiculous doth that man make
   himself that will all his time go under the name of a merchant, and yet
   never understand any thing of merchandize? or if a man will be called a
   philosopher, when every one that knows him, knows that he understands
   not any of the principles of philosophy? But,

   5. It is of so great importance to understand well the principles of
   Christian religion, that they need to be taught. Is there so great
   weight laid upon the teaching of them? are they hereby represented to
   us to be matters of absolute necessity? then by the importance of the
   principles judge of the excellency of the end of the Christian
   religion. And so consider, Hath God thus brought it about that we
   should be all of us in one degree or other under the Christian
   institution? What is it for? That which hath so very important
   principles must have a proportionable end. Then let us see what that
   is. Religion is a thing that terminates upon eternity, that runs into
   another world: they therefore that are under the Christian institution
   (as we all are to be in the church of God while we are here in the
   world) are to look upon themselves as so many candidates for the
   blessed eternity. Here in this world we are training up for heaven, for
   everlasting glory; and hereupon are the principles of religion, of the
   Oracles of God, represented as the most important things, that have
   their final and determinate reference to another world, the glories of
   the heavenly and eternal state. This were a great thought for us to
   carry about with us, whensoever we are under gospel teaching, to think
   that God hath provided and taken care that I should be trained up for
   heaven and fitted for the eternal kingdom, and for an everlasting abode
   in that blessed glorious state. And when you are training up your
   child, Oh! how great a thing is it to be training it up in the
   knowledge of God! for there are some steps that must be taken with it,
   to make it meet for partaking "of the inheritance of the saints in
   light." You know there is great care taken about the education of great
   heirs. The very children of the church are God's children. He calls
   them so, (Ezekiel xvi. 20, 21.) "Is this a small matter that thou hast
   slain my children?" speaking of Jewish parents making their children
   pass through the fire to Moloch. In the degenerate state of that church
   and people, he calls them his children: now I say, great care is wont
   to be taken in the education of great heirs. Those that are the
   children of God and are really so, if children they are also heirs; and
   they are begotten to a lively hope, to an inheritance that is
   incorruptible and undefiled. And they are, by "the sincere milk of the
   word" which they receive from time to time, to grow up to a fitness and
   capacity to partake of that inheritance. We should never think of the
   principles of the Christian religion, but it should put us in mind of
   the end of it, and what it refers to. And yet again,

   6. We may further learn from hence, that since there is such need that
   such principles should be taught, men should take heed of neglecting,
   and much more of opposing any fit methods wherein they may be taught.
   And why do they so? Why they think themselves too wise to learn, they
   understand too much already to need being taught. But while they
   account themselves so very wise, see how the Spirit of God counts them,
   what notion they pass under with him; "fools despise instruction."
   Prov. i. 7. And that is certainly a very ill character, that the
   contempt of instruction brings upon persons: they think themselves
   wise, and God thinks them fools; and certainly his judgment is the most
   discerning and true: and as it draws on a bad character, so it is very
   likely to draw on a bad end and issue. To hate instruction is to hate
   knowledge: and he is said to love knowledge that loves instruction.
   Prov. xii. 1. But to be brought in under the notion of a hater of
   knowledge, divine knowledge, Oh! how dreadful a thing is that! "They
   shall call but I will not answer, they shall seek me early but they
   shall not find me." Why what is the matter? what is all that resolved
   into which you read to that purpose in the 1. Prov? Why in the 29th.
   verse it is said, Because they hated knowledge and would not choose the
   fear of the Lord; therefore he would be deaf to all their cries and
   importunities, when destruction was coining upon them as a whirlwind.
   Why is God so inexorable towards them? Because they hated knowledge,
   they would not endeavour to learn. And

   7. Lastly. If there be so absolute a necessity of being taught Such
   principles of religion or such "Oracles of God," there surely ought to
   be a very peculiar temper and disposition of spirit in order to
   learning. And that I would have you to take an account of in a few
   heads which I shall only name. We are all to be learners here in this
   world, we must learn as long as we live. And if it be of so absolute
   necessity that we learn such things we should,

   (1.) Apply ourselves to them with very great reverence, for they are
   "the Oracles of God" that we have to do with: it is something sacred
   and divine, that we are conversant and taken tip about. When any thing
   of these oracles was to be first given in writing, though it was but a
   little, to a peculiar and select people of his, we see what an awful
   business was made of it. God comes down; manifests his glorious
   presence in the mountain that he had selected for that purpose, the
   people are there assembled and cast about the foot of the mountain; the
   mountain is enclosed, and they are forbidden, on pain of death, to
   approach the borders; "Touch not the borders; for whosoever toucheth
   them shall die." Exod. xix. 20, 21. In that assembly of that people, on
   purpose to hear the divine oracles that were to be preached among them,
   there was a glorious revelation that came from heaven. And do we think
   the gospel revelation that we have is less glorious? No, saith the
   apostle "The glory wherewith the law was given upon Mount Sinai, was no
   glory in comparison with this glory that so much excels." Oh! we should
   be learners with the greatest reverence imaginable, as having from time
   to time the divine oracles to be opened among us. Here is the most
   glorious appearance of God. When there was comparatively an unspeakably
   less appearance even than that on Mount Sinai, that is, when some of
   the divine glory shone in one bush, it is charged upon Moses (to strike
   his mind with a due awe) presently to put off his shoes. This was to be
   significant to us, with what great and profound reverence we are to
   have our souls impressed and possessed upon an appearance of God; and
   these are the brightest and most glorious appearances, in the kind,
   that we know above any besides.

   (2.) We should apply ourselves to learn the things of the kingdom of
   God with very deep humility; with a most humble sense of our own
   ignorance, and that we know so little. "He that thinks he knows any
   thing knows nothing as he ought to know," saith the apostle. And
   nothing was a more ignominious brand upon a sort of men that did start
   up early in the Christian church, that affected to be called by the
   name of gnostick, than that they so much valued themselves upon that
   knowledge to which they pretended, and but pretended; as that name did
   signify. Whether they were so soon called by that name, as some
   imagine, is a matter of doubt, but the genius and spirit of the men
   undoubtedly appeared early; and many pas sages in the epistles of the
   apostles have a direct reference thereunto, as particularly that (1
   Cor. viii. 2.) "Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth." But (I say)
   it was the ignominy and reproach of that sort of men that they did so
   highly glory in an airy kind of knowledge, that they were never the
   better for, nay, that made them undoubtedly upon the whole matter much
   worse men: it doth always so where there is not great humility, which
   doth accompany and go with knowledge. That is, they who are learners
   ought to consider themselves as such, as we must all of us always be
   while we are here in this world, such as "know but in part." Here we
   are to have very self-diminishing thoughts of our own knowledge. Surely
   it is but little that we know, as we find Agur speaks concerning
   himself; k( I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
   understanding of a man." And so the Psalmist speaks of himself (73.
   Psalm) "So foolish was I and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee."
   Such diminishing thoughts it becomes us to have of ourselves, as to
   look upon ourselves, under such a self-despising notion, (as I may so
   speak) that while we are here we are but in a state of learners, and
   must be so as long as we are in this earthly state. But then,

   (3.) We should be learners still with fervent desire of learning more
   and more; and this agrees well with a humble sense of our yet knowing
   so very little. It hath always been mentioned concerning one eminent
   heathen, as an honourable character he went under, that he was known by
   that motto, "Hoc tantum seio, me nihil scire:" this only I know, that I
   know nothing: though he was one of the greatest and most learned men of
   his age. If there be a sincere desire of increasing knowledge, nothing
   better agrees with it than such a sense as this, Alas! it is little I
   know and I am to be still aiming to know more and more, in reference to
   things wherein I am so much concerned "I opened my mouth and panted,"
   saith the psalmist, "for I longed for thy commandments." Psalm cxix.
   131. We are to be continually desiring that which is to be the means of
   our growth in knowledge. "As new-born babes desire the sincere milk of
   the word that ye may grow thereby:" and these principles are called
   "milk," as you see in the close of this 5th. chap. of the epistle to
   the Hebrews, where the text is.

   (4.) It ought to be with a continued pleasant savour and relish of
   divine knowledge, that we should be driving the design to increase: to
   increase and grow in it. "Grow in the grace and in the knowledge of our
   Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;" labour to have a continual intermixture
   of grace with knowledge that may give it a pleasant savour. There is
   very little delight in dry notions that never influence a man's heart,
   "When wisdom enters into the heart and knowledge is pleasant unto the
   soul" (saith the wise man) "then understanding shall preserve thee,
   discretion shall lead thee." Knowledge doth its office effectually, to
   guide and lead us in our way when once it becomes of a grateful taste
   and relish to our souls; if it be taken and digested, and we relish a
   sweetness and pleasantness in it, then it will have power to do it's
   work, that is, to be our guide and director in our way and course, as
   you have it Prov. ii. 10. And then,

   (5.) It ought to be with continual gratitude, adoring and blessing God
   that he makes any of his light to shine in this dark world; especially
   that it should shine to any of us; that we have this "sure word of
   prophecy" put into our hands that makes up the "Oracles of God" in an
   eminent sense; "till the day dawn and the day star arise in our
   hearts." And

   (6.) Lastly. It must be (or else we do nothing) with a serious design
   of getting a holy impression in our hearts by the truth we know, or
   else all is lost. There are too many, (the Lord knows) that if they
   take pleasure in knowing, and increasing knowledge, they do yet know
   but for the knowledge' sake, and aim no further. It is a fine thing to
   know much, to understand more than one's neighbour, more than such and
   such; and so be able superciliously to look down upon them as
   comparatively very ignorant. But to know on purpose, that I may be
   accordingly and do accordingly, is the true end of Christian knowledge.
   "I desire to know more that I may have a better heart, and that I may
   be able to love God more, that I may be more like God, more fitted to
   serve him, and walk with him in this world and enjoy him in the next:"
   if this be not the design we drive at, in aiming to know, in all our
   desire of knowing much of the things of God, and Christian religion we
   do but labour for the wind and shall at length reap the whirlwind. In
   what a transport is the apostle (in that 3. Phil:) in the thoughts and
   estimates that he expresseth there of the knowledge of Christ, "I count
   all things loss and dross and dung for the excellency of the knowledge
   of Christ Jesus my Lord!" Well but what sort of knowledge was it he
   aimed at? See what it was in what follows, such a knowledge as by which
   he might be transformed into his likeness, whereby he might be
   conformable to his death and to his resurrection, such a knowledge as
   to have the image impressed by it of a crucified and glorified Jesus.
   And no other knowledge would serve his turn, "I count all things but
   loss and dross and dung in comparison of the knowledge of Jesus Christ
   my Lord," so to "know him" as to "be found in him," as to have "the
   fellowship of hi sufferings and the power of his death," and to attain
   with him the resurrection from the dead.

   And I desire in the close of this discourse to leave this with you. It
   is a dreadful thing to trifle with sacred matters. If at any time we
   open this book, or any thing out of it be opened to us, and we have not
   that serious design before our eyes and upon our hearts, that we would
   know more of divine things, that we may be made more like God, and be
   more fitted for his service and communion both here and hereafter, we
   shall be found guilty of trifling with that which is sacred: and though
   in this world the punishment may not be so visibly severe, yet the
   guilt is undoubtedly great with, (and indeed incomparably greater
   than,) what Uzzah lay under when he rashly laid hold on the ark, and
   the Bethshemites when they opened and would be curiously prying into
   it. And what! do we therefore make light of God, and the sacred things
   of God, because in the gospel-days there are not so terrible examples
   set in view before our eyes? But if we look into the great mysteries of
   the divine kingdom, with a slight mind and a vain heart, without any
   serious design of the same thing that these discoveries, these truths,
   these doctrines that are brought to our knowledge are designed for, we
   are all that while deserving that, which will be worse in the issue and
   end, than to have the name put upon the place "Perez-Uzzah, the breach
   that Uzzah made," and it will be a more dreadful thing than if he did
   signalize the place by a terrible stroke from heaven upon us. When a
   man meddleth with the great things of God and can give no account for
   what, but only to satisfy his own curiosity, and the idle fancy of a
   vain mind; this will have a sad issue. But let it be for this, and my
   heart bear me record that it is for this, that I may become a serious,
   holy, knowing christian, a useful christian; that I may live up to
   Christianity through the whole of my course while I am here upon earth,
   and then shall I be fitted at length for the heavenly inheritance with
   the saints in light, who shall possess that glorious inheritance.

   Our next great work will be to fall upon the first principle, the very
   first of these principles, that which is the principal of principles;
   and that is concerning the Deity; the deepest foundation of all our
   religion.

LECTURE III. [111]

   Rom. i. 20.

   For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
   are clearly seen, being understood by the things that
   are made, even his eternal power and God
   head; so that they are without excuse.

   OUR business (as we have proposed you know) is, with God's gracious
   assistance, to open to you the principles of religion. Christian
   religion (which we finally intend) is founded in natural: and the
   principles of the former must be understood, therefore, to comprehend
   the latter, as things at least necessarily pre-supposed unto the
   doctrine of Christ. Now it being our design, in the general, to open to
   you the principles that do any way belong to that doctrine, we choose
   (as it is most fit) to begin with HIM who is the beginning of all, the
   principle that is most firstly first, primo primum, as they use to
   speak. Such is the Deity whether we speak of principles of being or of
   knowledge: for there is no being that depends not upon the Divine
   Being, and no knowledge, rightly so called, which some way or other
   depends not upon divine knowledge. He is not only the first being, but
   the first and primary known, the primum esse and the primum
   cognoscible, as he is justly to be reckoned.

   Now this text shews us the true method of arriving to the knowledge of
   him, the unmade Being, by the things that are made; and not only to the
   certainty of his existence, but of the excellency of his nature; both
   discoverable by the same light, by the same evidencing mediums, which
   that you may see, let us view the contents of this text briefly. We
   have in it

   First, What is revealed concerning God, expressed first of all more
   indefinitely, "the invisible things of him." This must not be
   understood distinctively, as if some things of God were visible and
   some invisible; that is, of things belonging to the divine nature; but
   it must be understood adversatively, that is, though they are
   invisible, and notwithstanding their in visibility, they are yet
   clearly demonstrable by the things that are made. And then, secondly,
   they are declared to us more expressly, first, in one great instance of
   his eternal power, the effects whereof we see (as is here said) in the
   things that are made. But the cause itself is still invisible. And this
   is most fitly instanced in reference to the creature and the creation,
   which is said to be demonstrative thereof. All this vast creation, with
   that great variety of creatures that do compose and make it up, having
   lain in that, as in the pregnant womb thereof, from all eternity; out
   of which it is at length produced by it as its mighty creative cause.
   And then, secondly, besides this instance of one peculiar excellency of
   the Divine Being, (his eternal power) to save a long and a particular
   enumeration, all the rest of the divine excellencies, are summed up in
   that one expression, "Godhead:" his eternal power and Godhead,
   comprehending all his other excellencies and perfections besides. This
   is the first thing we have to note to you from the text what is
   revealed concerning God, even the invisible things of him, particularly
   his eternal power, the immediate cause of all things, and his Godhead
   which comprehends all his excellencies together. And,

   Secondly: We have to consider here the revelation hereof, these things
   "are clearly seen," seen, and clearly seen. This indeed looks like a
   riddle; invisible things seen! and clearly seen! things seen that are
   invisible, or that cannot be seen! But the next words solve it, "being
   understood by the things that are made." Seen! How are they seen? Not
   occularly, but intellectually, they are seen as being understood. They
   are seen by the eye of the mind, though they cannot be seen by the
   bodily eye. God, and every thing belonging to the nature of God, being
   in that respect by the excellency thereof invisible. But it may be
   said, How are they so seen and clearly seen by the minds and
   understandings of men? when the complaint is concerning men generally,
   even in the very context, "their foolish hearts are darkened," and "the
   light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not;" as
   it is in the beginning of John's gospel. How then are they
   intellectually seen? Why nothing is more usual than to express a matter
   of right (where that right is most evident) by matter of fact, and by
   such forms of speech as signify the fact. "No man liveth to himself:"
   that is, no man should. It is so plain a case that no man should live
   to himself, that when the design is to speak the reason of the thing,
   this is the expression of it, "no man liveth to himself," that is, is
   allowed to do so; and indeed in common language it is usual to express
   the passive future by the present or the preterit, as we say, vir
   spectatus, for vir spectabilis, or spectandus; one that is very much
   regarded, for one that ought to be or deserves to be so. And a thing
   that we say is indubitate fidei, of undoubted faith and certainty: we
   mean by it indubitande, that ought not to be doubted, or that there is
   no reason why it should be doubted. So "clearly seen" here, is clearly
   to be seen and understood, that is, such as might be understood, that
   ought to be understood, and there is no reason, why they are not
   understood, but because men will not under stand; shut their eyes and
   are willingly blind and ignorant, "not liking" (as it is afterwards
   expressed in the context) "to retain God in their knowledge." Or, there
   are here things so clearly to be understood, that they are manifestly
   left (as the close of this verse is) without all excuse who understand
   them not. And upon that account, in the words presently following,
   "that which may be known:" (so we read it) the expression is, that
   which is known of God; but the meaning is, that which may be known of
   God, as we translate it. Then,

   Thirdly: We are to consider the evidencing medium in the text, "by the
   things that are made:" the made things that are visible, are clearly
   demonstrative of their unmade Cause, of the excellency of the power and
   Godhead of that invisible Being, who is the unmade Maker of them. And

   Fourthly: You have the constancy and continuedness of this concealment
   and revelation, "from the creation of the world." It is not ek out of,
   but apofrom; and notes the term of time and not casualty, which is
   expressed in the other phrase of speech, we noted to you before, "the
   things that are made." But all along, ever since the world began, ever
   since there was a world in being, the invisible things of God, his
   eternal power and Godhead: they have been concealed and revealed:
   concealed in one respect; that is, they have been invisible to mortal
   eyes: and revealed in another respect; that is, have been visible to
   mortal minds. And then you have

   Fifthly: In the last place, (which will be fit to be considered as the
   use of all,) the inexcusableness of those that receive not this
   revelation; so that they are without excuse, that do not acknowledge
   and adore the invisible Godhead, so demonstrating himself by the things
   that are made.

   As to what we intend, you may take the ground of the whole discourse
   from this scripture thus,

   That the sundry, excellencies of the Divine Being, all-comprehending
   Godhead, are clearly demonstrable by the things that are made. And you
   may take in (as that which gives the greater lustre to the truth) that
   which is put adversatively, if you please, notwithstanding their
   invisibility in themselves.

   In speaking to this, these two things are principally to be insisted
   on:

   I. They shew you what the Godhead comprehends, as far as is needful or
   possible unto us, or what are the excellencies that belong to the
   nature of God. And then,

   II. To shew how these are demonstrable of him by the things that are
   made.

   I shall not dispute the reasonableness of that method in Speaking to
   other subjects, first to inquire about the an sit, and then about the
   quod sit or rather the quid sit; to inquire first whether such a thing
   be, and then to inquire what it is. There may, indeed, as to some
   confused knowledge of a thing, be an inquiry concerning it's existence,
   and afterwards a descent made to inquire more particularly into its
   precise nature. But simply speaking, it would be the most absurd thing
   in the world to inquire first whether this or that be, before there is
   any apprehension at all what it is: for then we inquire about a shadow;
   and neither he that demonstrates, nor he to whom the demonstration is
   made, can do other than beat the air; the one understands not himself,
   nor can the other understand what he goes about. But it would be much
   more absurd in this case, to follow such a method as that, because by
   universal consent, the divine nature includes existence in it, which
   some therefore rely upon as sufficient demonstration of the existence
   of God, that is, that his very idea doth include existence, so that it
   is impossible to conceive of the Divine Being, but we must conceive of
   it as existing, inasmuch as the very idea and notion of it is inclusive
   of all perfections, whereof existence cannot be but one. and a very
   fundamental one too to all the rest. And therefore it must be a
   manifest contradiction, so much as but to suppose, that the most
   perfect Being must not exist, because a possibility of not existing is
   a very great and manifest imperfection.

   But that is not the method of demonstration which I choose, but that
   which the text lays before us, that is, to demonstrate by that which is
   made, both the certainty of God's existence, and the excellency of his
   nature. But the latter we must have some understanding of first,
   otherwise neither do I nor you know what we are doing, if we have no
   apprehension among us, who or what a one he is, whose existence we
   speak of.

   I. This therefore comes to be considered and inquired into, what
   excellencies we must suppose the Godhead or divine nature (which is all
   one) doth comprehend. And here it must be acknowledged, we enter into a
   vast and most profound abyss; and you and I have all of us great reason
   to apprehend our need of much forgiveness, that after so great
   opportunity as we have had to learn better, we understand and know
   little yet of what we are to speak and hear of; and we have great need
   to supplicate and look up, that we may be enabled to speak and hear
   worthily concerning the blessed and eternal God, and to speak things of
   him fit to be spoken, and to hear them as it is fit to hear such
   things.

   Why, in general it is certain the name of God doth import a Being
   absolutely perfect, a Being comprehensive of all perfections.

   And now here it may be said, This throws us into a sort of despair; for
   certainly a Being comprehensive of all perfections, must be to us
   altogether incomprehensible; we can never comprehend what doth itself
   comprehend all things.

   I answer, Very true indeed: and yet there is a knowledge of this
   incomprehensible and all-comprehending Being, which is necessary as our
   first step, not only in what we are now about, but in reference to
   whatsoever else we have to go about to do, or to enjoy in all time, or
   in all eternity. But to relieve our thoughts here a little, you must
   know that we are not to treat of this incomprehensible and
   all-comprehending Being, in the way of metaphysicians and philosophers,
   who must have notions of things, ideas of them (it is that which they
   profess and pretend to) adequate to the things themselves whereof they
   treat; but our business is to speak of this ever-blessed Being as
   persons professing religion; not as philosophers, but as religionists;
   and so we are to consider him as the Object of our religion, the first
   thing to be considered in all religion; and so the name of our inquiry
   comes to this: Have we an object for our religion, yea or no? And if we
   cannot reach to comprehend (as it is impossible we should) all that
   doth belong to the Godhead, if yet we can reach to apprehend, so much
   as will represent and recommend him to us, as a worthy, deserving
   Object of our religion, our business is done: that is what we design,
   and we may know so much concerning him as to know him to be a fit
   Object, or worthy of religion, without knowing all of him, which is
   impossible: and if it were possible it would undeify him. He could not
   be God if we could comprehend him. He could not be a Deity if a finite
   mind were comprehensive of him.

   And that you may a little understand the reasonableness of what I now
   say, do but consider what knowledge of man it is necessary for you to
   have in order to your conversing with men. Is it not possible for one
   man to converse with another, without having a full and entire
   knowledge of the full and entire guidity (as I may so speak) of human
   nature? must a man know all the properties and attributes of human
   nature, or he cannot converse with men? I hope there are many men
   converse one with another besides philosophers. And so, I say, it is
   equally possible for you to converse with God, without knowing every
   thing belonging to his nature. It is enough in order hereunto, and that
   so you may be in a possibility of conversing with him by religion, as
   the great Object of your religion: the only Object of your religion,
   that you know him to be more perfect than any thing else, or all things
   else, though you do not fully know how excellent or perfect he is,. or
   ever can. But this our conception of him in the general, that he is a
   Being absolutely perfect, or universally perfect, must comprehend all
   that can be thought, and all that can be said concerning him. Yet, in
   the mean time, this is too general to denote to us the Object of our
   religion. We must have more particular and more distinct thoughts of
   him whom we are to worship, to whom we are to pay all duty, and from
   whom we are to expect all felicity, than only this one general notion
   doth furnish us with. That is, that he is one that is universally or
   absolutely perfect; we must necessarily descend and come down to
   particulars; and think what particulars are necessary to constitute and
   make up for us the object of our worship and religion. And so you may
   take this more particular (though yet short) account.

   When we inquire, What doth the idea or notion of God include? what are
   we to conceive of the nature of God, as he is the Object of our
   religion? we must have such a representation of him as this in our
   minds; that he is an eternal, self-subsisting Being, himself unmade,
   and the intelligent and free Author and Original of every thing that is
   made. Conceive him so, and you have before you the Object of your
   worship, the Object of religion, one that claims by a natural right
   that you fall down and adore him. This is some answer to the former of
   these inquiries, What we are to conceive by that name of God as
   represented and held forth to us under that name, or what is it that
   the Godhead doth comprehend, so far as is answerable to our purpose,
   that is, of stating before you an object of religion.

   II. And now the second thing we have to do, is to demonstrate all this
   concerning God, by the things that are made: which is that method of
   demonstration that the text furnishes us with, and directs us unto. If
   such a Being as this doth exist in reality, have actual existence in
   such a Being, or he doth exist such and as such, then we can be in no
   further doubt, whether we have an object of worship, an object of
   religion yea or no. But now the demonstration of the existence of such
   a Being, by things that are made, must be done by parts, according as
   there are parts, that this representation of the object of religion is
   made up of, and so we shall proceed gradually part by part. As

   1 We have this to demonstrate to you, that there is existing an ETERNAL
   BEING, that was of itself, depending upon nothing for its being or
   existence; and this we have to demonstrate to you by the things that
   arc made; that is thus; though that eternal Being is invisible; you see
   him not with your eyes; it is a Being of too high an excellency ever to
   be seen of mortal eyes, or by the eyes of the flesh, or by external
   sense; yet there are things in being that are visible, and of the
   existence whereof you can be sure. You are sure that yourselves are,
   and that you are some of the things that are made; for you very well
   know, that you began to be, that you have not been always, and that you
   have been but a little while; then I say, from that which you may be
   sure of, that it is a being, you may be likewise sure, there is an
   eternal Being that was from everlasting of itself. And I would not have
   you herein to debase your own minds and understandings, as if they
   could not be at a certainty about such a thing as this, though the
   matter falls not under the sight of the eye. As to what is to be
   inferred, to be collected and concluded, it would be too great a
   debasement of human nature and the mind and spirit of a man, to suppose
   or imagine that this mind and spirit cannot be as certain of its
   object, as external sense can be of its object. You think you are very
   sure of what you see with your eyes, and you have reason to think you
   are so: and you are so. But I would have you to apprehend too, that you
   may be as sure of something that you only know with your mind as you
   can be of any thing that you see with your eyes: and you wrong your own
   understandings if you will not think the one sort of things to be as
   certain as the other sort. You think (for instance) we are all very
   sure that we see one another, and are here present together at this
   time: you see me and I see you. No man but will think this a very
   absolute certainty of what falls under sight. But let me appeal to you
   now, whether you cannot be certain of something that only falls under
   the view of your mind, and not under your sight at all. Are you not as
   sure that two and two make four, as you are that you and I see one
   another? the one as an object of the mind only, the other as an object
   of sense. And pray is not the one of these as certain as the other? Am
   I not as certain that two and two make four, as that we see one
   another? Have you not as much satisfaction of the truth of the one as
   of the truth of the other? Well, that being now laid, I doubt not but
   if you will use your understandings, you will see and confess that you
   are as certain, that an eternal Being is, which you see not, as you are
   that any being is, that you do see.

   Why! How can we be as certain? you will say.

   Why, plainly and shortly thus, from this consequence, If any thing is,
   something hath always been. Do but consider and weigh in your own minds
   the clearness of this consequence. If you can be sure that something
   now is, you may be as sure that something hath ever been, been from
   eternity, or (which is all one) that there is an eternal Being. Well
   but how will this consequence be made out? Why, plainly, by taking the
   reverse of it. Do but suppose with yourselves, nothing more is; then
   the manifest consequence will be, that to eternity nothing can ever be,
   and of this (if you will think) you may be as sure, as you can of this,
   that two and two make four. That is, do but lay down this, and suppose
   it: there is nothing now in being no where, or any where; whatsoever
   there was, there is now nothing of one sort or another in being; you
   then may. be sure, that to all eternity nothing can ever happen to be:
   for nothing can spring, or start up out of nothing into being of
   itself. Can you be surer of any thing than of this, that if you could
   suppose the whole universe of being not to be, or that from eternity it
   was not, to all eternity it would never be, it could never be. Then how
   plain a consequence is this, if something now is, something hath always
   been: if there be any being, there is an eternal Being. For if there
   had been any time, or any moment, in all conceivable eternity wherein
   there was nothing in being, nothing had ever come into being, or could
   possibly have done so. This then is the first step, there is an ETERNAL
   BEING, and nothing can be plainer. But now,

LECT. IV. [112]

   2. We come in the next place to prove to you the self-existence of such
   a Being. There is such a Being first, and now secondly, that eternal
   Being must be of itself, could no other way be, but of and from itself.
   Now here you must conjoin these two things in your own thoughts, that
   so (as you will see in the sequel) every thing that is thus proved, may
   be found to be proved of one and the same being. Now then it is
   evident, that this eternal Being is the first of all beings, there can
   be nothing before it, and therefore it cannot have its existence from
   another, there being nothing before it, from whence it could have its
   existence, and therefore it must have its existence from itself: not by
   once beginning to exist, for we have shewn already, it is impossible,
   that if there were nothing in being, any thing should of itself rise up
   out of nothing into being. And therefore this is such a Being, as must
   be understood by the excellency of its own nature, to have been always
   in being without beginning, and so it will appear to be an eternal
   Being, and to be a self-existing Being both at once: or (which is all
   one) a necessary Being, a Being that doth not depend upon will and
   pleasure, as all made things do. All made things depend upon will and
   pleasure; "for thy pleasure they are, and were created." But the unmade
   Being must needs be self-existent, no way depending upon the pleasure
   of another, there being nothing before it, and so (which is the same
   thing) itself necessarily existing, as that excellency, that peculiar
   excellency of its own nature, to which it was simply repugnant not to
   exist. And so for the same reason if there have been an eternal
   self-subsisting Being, there must be still an eternal self-subsisting
   Being, for it is upon these terms, and for that reason for which it was
   impossible to it ever not to be. And so that nature which he is pleased
   to assume to himself is most admirably expressive of this peculiarity
   of his nature, "I AM THAT I AM," or simply "I AM." Exod. iii. 14. All
   beings besides, being but (as it were) shadows of being in comparison
   of this. And

   We are further to conceive and to prove concerning this Being, its
   causation of all things else, this is an attribute of the Divine Being
   as it is itself without cause, so to be the Cause of every thing.
   Itself unmade, but the Maker of all things that are made. A thing the
   blessed God doth justly and often glory in, in sundry parts of
   Scripture: "The Maker of heaven and earth." The first as well as the
   last. He of whom and from whom all things are; and we are told again
   and again how, in the beginning of Genesis, and the beginning of the
   gospel of John and elsewhere, to wit, by a word's speaking. He spake
   and they were made. He commanded and they stood forth. That there are
   made things is a proof to us that he was their Maker. A made thing and
   a maker are relatives one to another, and there can be no maker of that
   which was of itself. Whence should that which was made not of itself
   come, but from that Being that was of itself?

   4. We must conceive and may clearly prove from what is made, the vast
   power of the Eternal Being. The things that are made prove that he is a
   Being of the greatest conceivable power, the greatest that we can
   conceive, and indeed unspeakably greater than we can conceive. This
   appears in that, first, he hath made all things out of nothing: as
   nothing can of itself arise out of nothing, so it is the greatest power
   that is conceivable to bring any thing out of nothing: if all the
   contrivance and all the power of this world were put together to bring
   the least thing out of nothing, you would easily apprehend it
   impossible to all. If all the force that is in this whole earth, and
   even in the whole creation, should be exerted together to bring a grain
   of sand out of nothing, you would easily apprehend it would never be,
   and therefore how vast is that power of this Eternal Being! he to whom
   the eternal Godhead belongs, (as the text speaks) to bring things into
   being that were not; that were nothing immediately before. But then,
   secondly, consider also the vastness of the creation. To bring the
   least thing out of nothing must require the greatest power, but to
   bring so great a creation as this out of nothing, is that which doth
   render the power of the Creator, both perspicuous and admirable at
   once. To have such a frame of things as we behold with our eyes "from
   day to day made to rise up out of nothing, and only by a word speaking,
   how perspicuous and admirable doth it evidence his infinite power! But

   5. We are to apprehend, and may prove the admirable beneficence of him
   that made them. If we cast our eye through the universe, and consider,
   that the first order of creatures that have life are made capable of
   pleasure; some kind of satisfaction to themselves, that is, that are
   capable of the meaner life, the sensitive life; and that the creatures
   beneath them are made to afford the matter of that pleasure, when it
   was very easily possible for a Being of vast, immense power to have
   made creatures only for self-torment; upon this account it appears that
   the whole earth, the whole creation is full of his goodness. So that
   rising a little from the meanest sort and order of creatures, you
   immediately ascend to such a sort and order of creatures as hath, every
   one, its suitable delectation. That all the repasts of that life that
   are given to the several orders of creatures, are mingled and sweetened
   with so much delight, speaks all to be full of his goodness. Whatsoever
   is necessary for the support of it, is generally taken in with delight
   and complacency. If this Being who is the Author and Spring of all
   other beings, were not a being of admirable goodness and beneficence it
   had been as easy a thing to him, that what should have been necessary
   for the support of inferior beings should always have been accompanied
   with torture as well as pleasure. That whereas we and the creatures
   beneath us find it needful in order to the support of life to eat and
   drink, he might have ordered it so that there never should have been
   eating and drinking without torment: now we find it is with continued
   pleasure, for the greater part, with all sorts of creatures whose case
   doth require it. And again,

   6. We must understand from the things that are made, this Eternal Being
   to have been their intelligent and designing Maker. We are to prove
   this intellectuality from the things that are made; that he is an
   intellectual Being, that he did not give rise to this creation by an
   effort of vast and resistless power alone; but by a power that was
   guided and governed by wisdom, so as to know and design all his work
   throughout. And (as I have told you) it being our business in speaking
   to this head, to evince and make out to you an object of religion, to
   give you a plain and satisfactory answer to this first question, Have
   we an object of religion yea or no? this is most absolutely necessary
   to the resolution of it. We have not an object of religion without
   this, that is, without the supposition of an intellectual designing
   Maker of all things. If we should suppose only an Almighty Maker of
   things, who made them without wisdom, without design, intending no such
   thing; if the effort of such a power as we could not resist, and it
   could not of itself withhold, had thrown up such a creation as this is,
   out of nothing into what it is, if that had been possible, here had
   been no object of worship, no object of religion, that is, there would
   have been nothing that would either deserve or could receive religious
   homage from us: nothing that could deserve it, because the thing was
   altogether (upon this supposition) without design. If a mighty violent
   storm had thrown in upon the coast some vessel full of rich treasure,
   and I was passing by it, and (it being without an owner, no one laying
   claim to it) it were thrown into my lap, would I fall down and worship
   the storm? though I might him that guided and directed it. Nor indeed
   as an undesigning cause of all things could not deserve religious
   homage, so neither could he receive it. It would be an absurd thing to
   pay a religious homage where there could be no reception of it, where
   no notice could be taken of it. But nothing is more evident from the
   things that are made, than that the Maker of them hath done all with
   most profound and wise counsel; he hath therein displayed an infinite
   understanding and thereby made known that his understanding is in
   finite. By wisdom are. the heavens stretched forth and the earth
   established and founded. Which appears several ways:

   (1.) In the order which is every way observable in the creation of God.
   Wisdom only is the parent of order, and order the product of wisdom. It
   cannot be, that there should be accurate and continued order by chance.
   When the letters of the alphabet are put into such an order as to
   express such and such sense, will any man say this was by chance, and
   this was without design? especially when this is continued, when they
   are repeated over and over again, in such order as to make a volume:
   the very thing (1 remember) that the pagan, Cicero takes notice of and
   urgeth for the proving of a Deity; the creating of the world by a wise
   and designing cause, against the epicureans who would have it arise
   only out of the fortuitous jumble of several particles of matter,
   called atoms. "You might as well (saith he) suppose that the letters of
   the alphabet in great numbers shaken together in confusion, and thrown
   out, should fall into the order of Ennius's poems, so as of themselves
   without design to compose such a history as his, all in verse." When we
   consider the order that is between things and things, how exact a
   course and motion, the sun, moon, and planets and other stars do hold,
   so as that a man of weak understanding can tell you at what hour, in
   such a month and such a day of the month, the sun will rise and set,
   and so of the moon; and so (those that do observe them) of the planets
   and other stars besides; and then to see the constant succession of
   summer and winter, spring and autumn, day and night amongst us: whence
   comes all this order? What! from no designing cause? And again,

   (2.) Consider the aptitude of things to their end, the several ends
   they are appointed to serve for, #s, who can comprehend that such a
   thing as our eye was made for any thing else but to see with, and our
   foot but to walk with, and our hand but to work with, and such a thing
   as the ear was made for any thing else but to hear with? Who can
   comprehend that there should be that strange and exact aptitude in
   every thing for the ends and purposes that they do serve for, without a
   design that they should serve those purposes? And this would be a great
   deal more convictive, if it were so obvious to every one to take notice
   of, and observe many things that are more latent, and lie out of common
   view: to think how the several veins and arteries do receive and
   distribute and return back again the blood from its fountain, the
   heart, so as continually to renew strength and vigour in the body as
   the matter doth require: to think of the admirable variety and
   suitableness of those things that we have in our bodies, called
   muscles, and all the several sorts of motion that are to be performed;
   about six (as is observed) belonging to the eye itself, without which
   it were impossible it should move in the several ways it doth: and
   about four hundred and thirty of these in one human body. If any man
   did by chance see a watch, who had never seen one before; but he finds
   upon observation, what uses and purposes it serves for in the general,
   and what purposes the several parts it was composed of do serve for, in
   order to that general end, will he not with the greatest confidence
   imaginable pronounce, "this was made with a design:" or would a man
   blame him for his confidence? Or if a man take upon him to pretend to
   such an excessive measure of wit as to say, "these things serve to such
   a purpose, for this general end, the measuring of time; and the several
   parts serve for several ends, this and that motion by which the whole
   is made useful to that common end: but this was never made by any human
   art or with a design, but the several parts of which it is composed
   being agitated variously by the wind, or motion of the air were thrown
   by mere chance into this figure, and so there resulted out of the whole
   such a little engine as this, that now you see serves these purposes;"
   who would not think that man with his pretences to wit, a madman that
   should give such an account as this, how a watch came to be made, when
   he sees what it serves for, and what its several parts do serve for, in
   subserviency and reference to the common end? And which way would you
   judge and pronounce with confidence that such a thing was made with a
   design, but by having so manifest characters upon it of a designing
   cause? so as that every one but a madman would presently say, this was
   done with a design and for such a purpose. But there is no one that
   hath given himself but to look a little into the composition of a human
   body but could see a hundred times more curiosity in so many hundreds
   of things that go to the composition of it. As I have told you, in each
   several muscle of a human body there is as much curiosity as can be
   taken notice of in a watch, and much more in the fabric and structure
   of the eye and of the ear. So that nothing can be imagined a greater
   absurdity than to suppose such things as those that we see are made,
   were made without design or otherwise than with design, and by a wise
   cause that was first productive of them and continues to be productive
   of them in the stated way that he hath set for them. And,

   (3.) We may conclude an intellectual designing cause of the things that
   are made, from very many of the things themselves, that not only have
   characters of a design upon them, and so thence appear to be made with
   design, but are made capable of design themselves; that is, the whole
   order of intelligent reasonable creatures. We are all of us convinced
   that we are not of ourselves, that we are made things, that our minds
   and spirits which we carry about with us are made things by one unmade.
   It is but a little while ago that they were not. But besides, they are
   things themselves capable of design: you know we lay our designs this
   way and that, we have our contrivance what we will do to-day and
   to-morrow and (it may be) the third day. And whence should a designing
   effect proceed but from a designing cause? If there be such a thing as
   wisdom among the things that are made, there must certainly be a wise
   maker; otherwise that wisdom being itself a made thing, was made by
   that which had nothing in it, out of which it could arise. But (as I
   told you before) it is altogether impossible for something to arise out
   of nothing itself. Therefore wisdom being somewhat and a made thing, it
   doth not arise of itself out of nothing, or that is of late beginning.
   A little while ago they were not, how comes wisdom into such a created
   kind of being? Why it shews the wisdom of an uncreated Being from
   whence it came. And,

   7. We may further hence collect the spirituality of this Being, that
   this Being is a Spirit, an eternal Spirit, an eternal mind; otherwise
   it were not capable of design. There are but two sorts of beings in
   general that we can so much as conceive of. These are mind and matter.
   Since we have proved to you, this Being is a designing Being, a wise
   intelligent Being, that proves it to be a mind, and spiritual Being,
   because matter is capable of no such thing as design: some indeed may
   apprehend that though gross matter cannot design, (a clod of clay we
   know can design nothing,) yet perhaps some finer sort of matter, pure
   and defected matter may. But I would have it considered what nearer
   approach to wisdom and reason there is in a flame of fire, than in a
   clod of clay. Can any man conceive that there is any greater
   disposition to reason or the exercise of wisdom in a blast of wind or a
   flame of fire than in a piece of dirt? Therefore we are here to
   attribute to the Deity that, that God is pleased to attribute to
   himself; to wit, that he is a Spirit, which further represents him to
   us as the Object of worship, and of suitable worship, forasmuch as he
   is to be worshipped, and worshipped in spirit and in truth. John iv.
   24. And indeed, otherwise it had been altogether impossible that this
   world should be made by a cause that were not purely mental, in its own
   being a mental and spiritual thing: for most manifest it is; matter as
   such is altogether inactive; and if you could suppose never so vast a
   collection of mere matter it would always remain a mere dead lump, as
   even the light of more intelligent and considering heathens could
   dictate to them: Mens agigat molem; it is the mind that doth actuate,
   and did at first this mighty moles of matter, so as to bring things out
   of it, appearing in such an order as we do behold, and that we may not
   go on further in particular enumerations, which we see the apostle, in
   the text, cuts much shorter, summing up all in the word Godhead,

   8. In the last place we may collect from the things that are made that
   this Being is absolutely perfect, or such as wherein all excellencies
   do concur in their highest perfection whether they be natural,
   intellectual, or moral, or those that we may conceive under these
   distinct notions.

   (1.) Natural, as life, original self-sprung life in the highest
   perfection of it, as it imports both a self-active and self-fruitive
   principle. And again, pure simplicity and uncompoundedness; the
   necessary exclusion of all composition that may import any thing of
   diminution or debasement, to that Being we are speaking of. And again,
   most absolute immutability and unchangeableness, as that mentioned
   name; "I AM THAT I AM" imports. Arid again, immensity, unconfinedness
   to any space whatsoever; so that "heaven and the heaven of heavens
   cannot contain" this Being. These are natural perfections that we must
   understand do belong to him. And then,

   (2.) All sorts of intellectual perfection that are truly such; as
   perfect knowledge of all things, even of minds and spirits themselves;
   and of future things that no eye can look into, but the divine eye.
   Most exact wisdom in all things else, as well as what appears in the
   making of this world, there is also requisite what doth appear in the
   continual government of it in changing the times and seasons, ordering
   things so as that they shall hit into their proper juncture, and meet
   in all their necessary circumstances that were needful to concur for
   such and such purposes. And then,

   (3.) Those that are called moral excellencies, such as truth and
   righteousness, and holiness and the like: these must be understood,
   upon the same grounds, all of them to meet and concur in their highest
   perfection in this Being. And the demonstration whereof is still too,
   from the things that are made, because there are ideas, images,
   vestiges of these things to be found up and down in the creation among
   the things that are made. We find that some things are more fickle than
   others, and some things more steady. And we find (as I said before)
   there is such a thing as wisdom, as knowledge, as holiness, as
   righteousness, to be found among the creatures; and this shews all
   these things must be in the highest perfection in the unmade Being.

   And I might add hereupon (as that which will be most necessarily
   consequent) that this Being must be infinite in all these perfections,
   because there is nothing in being, and nothing supposable ever to come
   into being, that doth not result and proceed from it. And that which
   comprehends all being and all perfection and all excellency, actual and
   possible, cannot be less than infinite; for there can be nothing more
   than all: but it is altogether impossible that there should be any
   thing, either that is in actual being now, or that can hereafter come
   into being, that comes not from this radical Being. This Being;
   therefore, which must virtually comprehend all that is actual and all
   that is possible, within the compass of its own power, cannot be less
   than infinite, because there can be nothing more than all, nothing
   beyond all.

   And for the same reason it will be most evident that this Being can be
   but one. But that I shall not now insist upon: it will fall into the
   discourse most suitably when we come to shew, though it be essentially
   but one, it is personally three, and that is only to be shewn from the
   Scripture. The unity of the Deity is indeed demonstrable from reason,
   but that there should be a trinity in it, is only to be known from his
   saying so who best knows his own nature. As "the things of a man" are
   only to be known by "the spirit of a man that is in him," so the things
   of God, and what is in his holy nature (otherwise not revealed) can
   only be known by the Spirit of God, as he shall think fit to reveal and
   make it known to us. But first, it will be needful to lay the
   foundation thereof in revealed religion, which is the great
   superstructure that is raised upon natural religion, or the natural
   notices of God, to wit, to evince to you that the Scriptures are of
   divine revelation which will fee the next work we have to do.

LEC. V. [113]

   Before we come to evince to you the authority of the Scriptures, I
   reckon nothing can be of greater importance than to enlarge somewhat in
   the USE of that we have been upon: for if we let what God is pleased to
   make known concerning himself, his own nature and existence, slightly
   pass without improvement, and lose that, we lose all. All our time is
   lost, and all our labour is lost if we can let so great a thing slide
   away without some proportionable improvement and impression: and here
   in lies the proper improvement of it. The state of things is sad among
   us, upon this account, that there is so little knowledge of God in the
   land: for this it hath cause to mourn, and I doubt will be made to do
   so: but if we had ten thousand times more of the knowledge of God than
   we have, if it be not a lively and impressed knowledge, it is all to no
   purpose: the increase of our knowledge would be but the increase of our
   sorrow, as it is said upon another account. You have heard from this
   scripture, that the existence and nature of God (though invisible) are
   clearly demonstrated by the things he hath made. The improvement I
   desire you to make of it, will be partly by way of information in some
   particular truths that may be deduced from it: partly by way of
   expostulation, touching sins repugnant hereunto: and partly by way of
   exhortation to agreeable duties.

   I. For truths that may be collected and inferred hence for our
   information, you may take such as these:

   1 That the mind of man is capable of arriving by way of argument unto
   the knowledge of God; it is capable of attaining in a way of
   argumentation to the knowledge of God's existence and in great measure
   of his nature too. For we are told, the eternal power and Godhead are
   to be clearly seen by the things that are made. Things in themselves
   invisible, and while they are in themselves invisible, if we are to
   come to the knowledge of them by the things that are made, how can that
   be but by way of argument? In themselves they are said to be invisible:
   those visible things that are beheld are not the eternal power and
   Godhead themselves, therefore we can come to the knowledge of the
   former by the latter no way but by intervening arguments, not
   immediately, for the things that are made are the medium. Therefore it
   is by way of argumentation formed from this medium, that we come to
   this knowledge of God's eternal power and Godhead, and this is that
   which concerns us very deeply to consider, that if in such a way as
   this we are to arrive at the knowledge of God, then it is of much
   importance to us to make a reflection upon ourselves, and understand
   that from hence, much is to be learned of our own nature. If in this
   way we are to understand any thing of God's nature, we must by
   consequence understand so much of our own nature: that is, that it is a
   reasonable nature, that it is an intelligent nature, that it is a
   nature capable of improving itself in point of knowledge, by
   ratiocination and discourse; and even of knowledge concerning the
   highest and greatest, and first knowable, that is God and the very
   nature of God. Indeed here the foundation lies of all obligation that
   can be upon us to be religious, to be obedient, to be subject, to the
   common Ruler of this world; that is, that God hath given us a nature
   capable of knowing him, and of arriving to this knowledge of him by
   this way of ratiocination, as the text implies: that is, to collect
   that there is an eternal power, and an essential Deity, from things
   that are made and extant to view. If we are to come by it, so we are to
   come by it in a reasoning way, and it is impossible for us to receive
   conviction concerning our own duty towards God, if we have not a right
   apprehension of our own natures, and what they are susceptible and
   capable of. God will deal with us at the last day, according to the
   nature that he hath given us; and therefore we ought to consider
   ourselves too according to that nature. There will be a judgment-day
   for men, when there will not for brutes; and if God will difference us
   in the final judgment, and doth difference us in the way of his present
   government, from inferior brute creatures, it concerns us to understand
   the difference too, and to know that we have natures capable of being
   so dealt with, and as God will finally deal with us; that he doth not
   deal with us unsuitably to the natures he hath first given us. "There
   is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty hath given him
   understanding." And if so, then he is to be dealt with accordingly; not
   like a stock or a stone, or a brute creature. It is a great
   signification to us of the capacity of the nature of man, that it
   should be said here, to all those that will use their understandings,
   the eternal power and Godhead are clearly seen, by the things he hath
   made. And that is one thing we have therefore to collect and infer for
   our own information, that the mind and understanding are capable of
   arriving by ratiocination and arguments to the knowledge of God. Indeed
   it would be a strange kind of perverseness to hesitate at the reception
   of this, because it is plain, that even lower things than our mental
   capacity are subservient to our reception of divine knowledge; for
   faith (that hath to do with the same kind of objects) comes by hearing:
   and if external sense is to be subservient to our reception of the
   knowledge of divine things, then certainly much more our understanding,
   which is a thing far nobler than our external sense, and therefore it
   is a higher and greater talent that we are to be accountable for. We
   are to be accountable for all our faculties, as so many talents that
   God hath intrusted us with; the faculty of seeing, the faculty of
   hearing, the faculty of remembering and the like. And what do we think,
   among the rest, the faculty of understanding in so plain and important
   a case as this, is to be exempted and left out? that God should have
   distinguished us by this in so great a measure from the beasts that
   perish, and we take no notice of the difference and not think ourselves
   accountable for it? No, if we are in this way capable of coming to the
   knowledge of God's eternal power and Godhead, certainly this ability of
   coming this way to this knowledge, is that which must be strictly
   accounted for another day; that we have such a power and use it not,
   such a capacity and endowment belonging to our natures and never use
   it, let It lie asleep, never exert and put it forth to so high and to
   so great a purpose as this is. But,

   2. We may further learn hence, that none who have the use of their
   understandings can ever be innocently ignorant of God. No, saith the
   text, there is so cleat a representation of the eternal power and
   Godhead in the things that are made, that if men will not yet know God
   they are left without excuse, without apology, the case admits of no
   apology. That there should be so clear a representation to an
   apprehensive creature, and he will not know God; there is nothing to be
   said for it. There is nothing to be said why they do not know him, why
   they do not live in the eternal adoration of him. The matter will be
   resolved entirely and only into this at the last, they have not known,
   because they have not liked to retain God in their knowledge, as it
   follows after, in the 20th. verse; and into that which we see in that
   of Ephes. iv. 18. that men are "alienated from the life of God through
   the ignorance that is in them and the blindness of their hearts. "Pray
   what kind of blindness is the blindness of the heart? That can be no
   blindness but voluntary blindness, affected blindness, chosen
   blindness; that men are blind because they will be blind, because they
   will not see. A blindness of the mere speculative understanding is
   quite another thing, but such a blindness as is referred to the heart,
   as having its seat and subject there, must mean a blindness that men
   voluntarily do continue themselves in, as he that stifly and resolvedly
   winks that he may act see the light.

   3. We may further infer hence, that the clearest rational knowledge of
   God is by no means so acquiesced in, as if that would serve the turn,
   and be answerable to the saving purposes and necessities of our souls.
   The rational knowledge of God; it may be had and it must be had, but it
   must not be rested in; for even this knowledge that doth in the means,
   the objective representation, lie so fairly compassable, (for the
   discovery is clear) is supposed to be clear; the invisible things of
   God, his eternal power and Godhead, are clearly seen, clearly to be
   seen, and there may be a reception in some measure, and proportionable
   to the representation of the object. Besides the objective
   representation, there may be a subjective reception; it is a supposable
   thing, and it is frequent (though not universal) that these things here
   spoken of under the notion of invisibles, are not only clearly to be
   seen, but seen: and yet, though this knowledge do lie so fairly
   compassable and may be actually obtained and received, men, for all
   that, may be left without excuse, for the reason referred to in the
   verse next but one foregoing, that is, that the truth that is received
   is held in unrighteousness. "The wrath of God is revealed from heaven
   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth
   in unrighteousness." And by this truth (it is plain by what follows) is
   principally and chiefly meant the truth concerning the existence and
   nature of God, "that which may be known of God" (so it immediately
   follows) "is manifest in them: for God hath shewed it unto them:" for
   the invisible things, such truths as these, may not only be represented
   but received; and being so, yet held in unrighteousness, defeated of
   their proper design; so that such are left without excuse; it not
   attaining the end that such a representation doth finally aim at.
   Indeed God would never be angry without a cause, therefore if they be
   under wrath, if the wrath of God be revealed from heaven, and flame
   against a wicked, atheistical world, it is plain they are without
   excuse.

   But now, will that knowledge of God serve our turn that will only leave
   us inexcusable? will that answer the purposes and necessities of our
   souls? It is a supposable thing that the clearest merely rational
   knowledge of God, may but leave men without excuse, therefore somewhat
   more is necessary, another sort of knowledge. That which is rational,
   may be had and ought to be had, and we shall most dearly answer for it,
   if we have it not: but then when we have it, that is not enough, it is
   necessary, but not sufficient.

   But then it may be said, What more is there wanting than to know
   clearly the invisible things of God, his eternal power and Godhead? Why
   I shall tell you in one word: To have that clear knowledge made vital.
   It is not the mere clearness, but the vitality, of the knowledge of God
   that must do the needful work in our souls, in order to our present
   serving of God, and walking and conversing with him in this world, and
   our final felicity and blessedness with him in the other world. Light
   there must be, but it must be the light of life, otherwise we shall
   never be the better for it. A light that is not vital will serve to
   condemn, but only a light that is vital will serve to save. There is,
   it is true, a light universally shining in every intelligent mind, in
   every conscience of man, but it is a light so little profitable to the
   necessity of an immortal soul, that that light is said to be but
   darkness, as in that 6 Mat. 23. "If the light that is in thee be
   darkness, how great is that darkness!" That is, serves for the
   advantage of souls (if they do acquiesce and take up their rest there)
   no more than mere darkness would have done. It is but equal to
   darkness, as to any thing of fruit, emolument and profit to them. And
   therefore, that light which is truly salutary and finally saving, is
   the light of life, such is the light which comes by Christ: "He that
   follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
   life." John viii. 12.

   But you will say, What is the difference? One man knows God, that is,
   he is well assured and able rationally to prove and demonstrate to
   another man, the existence of God and many particular things concerning
   his nature; and perhaps can speak more rationally to such a purpose
   than many another man that carries the reputation of a pious man,
   whilst perhaps this man is not so: Pray what is the difference?

   Why truly, this is a thing (because I must not insist in such a course
   as I am in, upon particulars) that may (I should think) be easily
   understood by any one. One, he knows the kind or nature of this or that
   food, or this or that drink, he is able to discourse rationally of it,
   and give an accurate description of the kind and properties of this or
   that sort of meat, or drink: another, he eats and drinks of it. Let the
   former, discourse as long as he will and never so understandingly and
   knowingly, and not eat or drink, he will be famished for all his
   knowledge: the other, he knows this is good meat, and this is good
   drink: and he eats and drinks heartily and is refreshed, and lives by
   it. Is not here a plain difference r Why here is the very difference as
   to the knowledge of God. One, he can discourse rationally and learnedly
   about many invisible things of God, his eternal power and Godhead, but
   he never closeth with them, his soul never inwardly unites with him as
   his best good, never subjects to him as his highest Lord, never fears
   him, never loves him, never trusts in him, nor delights in him as the
   other doth. Do you not begin to apprehend, here is a vast difference
   between knowledge and knowledge; one sort of the knowledge of God and
   another? How plain is it that with many men, the clearest and truest
   notions of God are only dead notions; lie dead in their minds, operate
   nothing there, make them no other sort of men than they would be, if
   they knew no such thing; or if they thought or believed quite the
   contrary? Take out all those notions of God which some men have in
   their minds, and put in the room of them quite contrary notions; a
   scheme of mere atheism, and the men are found not at all to differ.
   That man whose head before, was full of theism, is just the same man as
   when his head was full of atheism. There is knowledge, but no vitality:
   all his notions of God lie dead, and so are as if they were not. But
   here is the great difference when the light of life concerning God and
   the invisible things of God comes into the soul of a man, when these
   vital beams strike into the very centre of a man's heart, that the man
   not only hath light about these things, but is light. A wicked man hath
   light, but it is said of a good man, a regenerate man, he is light. "Ye
   were darkness but now ye are light in the Lord:" it hath quite altered
   his temper, begot a new frame and habit in his soul: that is, the
   knowledge of God hath begot an impression of godliness; and this is
   that you are to be driving at, and not to take up with any knowledge of
   God short of this. "He hath given us an understanding to know him that
   is true, and we are in him that is true." 1 John v. 20. We know him,
   and by that knowledge are wrought into a vital union. "We are in him,
   even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life."

   But it may be said, If such a further super-added knowledge of God be
   so necessary, what is the former rational knowledge worth? what doth it
   signify? and what doth it serve for?

   Why let me bring you back to the former illustration that I gave you
   before, about the knowledge of meat and drink. You see a plain
   difference between barely knowing that this is good and useful food,
   that would be proper and suitable drink; and knowing the same thing by
   taste and reception in order to nutrition: there is a very plain
   difference. But what! is the former knowledge therefore useless? that
   is, to know that this is good meat and drink, is it useless? Is it not
   a very necessary knowledge that a man should know what is fit to be
   eaten and drank and what not? If you had not so much knowledge of the
   former sort as to be able to say, "this is good food which, being duly
   received, may do me good; and that is poison; if I meddle with it, it
   will destroy me;" you could not distinguish bread and a stone: you
   could make no distinction. In what a case were that man in, that did
   not know bread and a stone asunder? So here, without such a rational
   knowledge of God, you cannot understand why one ought to be worshipped
   more than another, why more to be trusted, more to be loved than
   another. If you had not that former knowledge of God you would not be
   able to distinguish between a proper object of adoration But what can
   be plainer than this, that many things may be necessary for such and
   such a purpose, that yet are not sufficient for that purpose? We must
   distinguish between necessity and sufficiency. A rational knowledge of
   God is necessary, it doth not therefore follow that it is sufficient.
   If one of you did design, incoming hither, to come to the seat where
   you use to sit, it is necessary that in order to your coming to the
   seat, that you come to the door. But is therefore coming to the door
   sufficient? No, you cannot come to your seat unless you come to the
   door, but it doth not therefore follow that you had nothing more to do
   when you come hither to hear a sermon than only just to come to the
   door. Pray apprehend this, that many things are necessary that are not
   enough. It is necessary that you have this rational knowledge of God as
   the door, as an intermission into that vital unitive knowledge of him
   which is also necessary and which only is sufficient. And if the former
   of these be aimed at, with a design for the latter, with a humble
   dependance and sense of our own nothingness, blessing God that he is
   pleased, in that natural way, to reveal so much of himself, but also
   humbly craving, "Lord do not leave me here, let this vital light shine
   into my dark soul:" where his further communications are not despised,
   they will be had; where they are valued, where they are sought, an
   inquiring soul will not be left destitute. If indeed you think that
   your case is well already, and that you need no more of God, and that
   all is well enough, you may sit still and perish till you sink into
   perdition. But know that the benignity of his nature, and the methods
   he hath set on foot for the recovery and saving of lost sinners, will
   not let him throw away any soul that doth cry after him; will not hide
   himself from them that value the vital efficacious transforming
   knowledge of him as life itself, and beyond this natural life, which is
   the true sense of every sincere soul.

   4. We may collect hence, that the objection against the acknowledgment
   of a Deity, from his invisibility, must be most absurd, and
   contemptibly weak and silly. Nothing can be more so; "for the invisible
   things of him are clearly seen by the things that are made." Therefore,
   nothing can be more foolish than for one to say "I will believe there
   is no God, because I see him not: I see not the brightness of the
   appearance of his glory that should make me apprehend such a Being
   perfect, superior to, and more excellent than, all other that I have
   had, the knowledge of:" nothing can be more childish than this, for it
   is very plain that if God could be seen, he could not be God. The thing
   carries a repugnancy in itself; so mean a nature as can be visible
   cannot be the divine nature. As a heathen said, We are not to ascribe
   unto God, body or colour or quantity, or any such thing that belongs to
   objects that fall under our sense. "If we know (saith he) that there is
   a corporeal nature, and if we know that there is an incorporeal nature,
   in which of these shall we place the Divine Being? Certainly (saith he)
   in the incorporeal nature, which is higher and more excellent than to
   be seen with eyes, or to be heard with ears, or felt with hands, or
   expressed with human voice." It was the saying of Maximus Tyrius, the
   heathen philosopher. And I pray you, why should we be so averse to the
   entertainment and reception of invisibles in our minds? For which is
   nearer a kin to our minds, invisible things, or visible? Are not our
   minds invisible? He thinks with himself, "I am not to acknowledge a
   Deity unless I see him," Pray what is it in you that thinks so, that is
   so sensible: and capable of thinking at all? Did you ever see your own
   souls? Did you ever see your own minds? Are not we, as to the most
   noble and excellent part of ourselves, rather to be accounted ourselves
   among invisibles than among visibles? It was the saying of a poor
   pagan, when the season of his dying approached, and his friends about
   him were discoursing of his burial: "Bury me" saith he "Do you talk of
   burying me? what do you think this body is to me? Do with it when I am
   gone what you please: if you can catch me, bury me, but you shall never
   do that, for do you think this body is me?" And pray will you think so
   basely of yourselves as that this body is you? If it be not, it is a
   mind, a spirit, a soul in you, that is you: and is not that nearer of
   kin to invisible things than visible? That there should be an
   averseness and shyness to entertain in our minds invisible things
   because they are in visible, when our minds themselves are invisible,
   nothing can be more unaccountable and unreasonable than this. It shews
   us to be very low sunk, that the minds and spirits of men are become
   strangely degenerate things, when any thing because it is invisible is
   therefore reckoned unsuitable to them, for a reason for which they
   should be reckoned most of all suitable. And alas! how little things
   are we capable of comprehending by our sight, in comparison of the
   things that we cannot see? Is our sight fit to be the measure of all
   realities? How small a part of this universe can we measure with our
   eye! and must all the rest because we see it not, go for just nothing?
   Surely there are unspeakably greater things which we see not, than
   there are that we see. Therefore, a thing should not be reckoned less
   real, or less considerable, or less excellent, because it is invisible
   to us, that is, to the eye of our flesh: but unspeakably the more
   excellent and great for that very reason, for its not being seen.

   5. We may hence learn the unjust and mad presumption that is in sin.
   When the invisible things of God, his eternal power and Godhead are
   clearly seen in the things that are made, that is, they are clearly to
   be seen by the things that are made, that they have an invisible Maker,
   and the eternal power and Godhead of this their Maker is clearly to be
   seen, then how unjust and mad a presumption is it to sin! For is not
   that an affront to thy Maker? What doth sin signify but
   ungovernableness to him that hath power to govern me? And who hath a
   right to govern you, if not he that made you out of nothing? Are not
   you one of the things that were made? and who therefore shews the
   eternal power and Godhead of your Maker? How unjust a presumption then
   is it to sin! But how mad a presumption is it besides! That is, to
   consider a world of sinful creatures in an apostacy from God and a
   rebellion against him: from whom have they revolted? against whom have
   they rebelled? They are things that are made, that have rebelled
   against him that made them. An amazing thing, to consider the
   inhabitants of this world, the intelligent inhabitants of it! They are
   a company of made things, and this world that they inhabit is a made
   thing. A made thing! what doth that signify? Why a thing depending upon
   will and pleasure: a thing that may be, or not be; a thing that may
   continue in being or be thrown into nothing, thrown into destruction
   the next moment. Why here is a company of creatures, that have taken
   upon them to revolt from their Maker, to rebel against him that made
   them. A strange thing! they have not (as the expression is) a footing
   for their feet; they are made things, and this world a made thing; all
   which may be swept away with a breath. For men to take upon them to
   rise up against the authority of him that made them, when they cannot
   command a breath, not so much as a breath: for that which hath been
   made, how presently can he unmake it! That which hath been made by him
   can be unmade by him in a moment: all this world gone in a moment: how
   easily may that be done by him! Therefore sin, considered in its
   general nature, is the most unjust and mad presumption that ever could
   enter into the mind of a rational creature; unjust towards God, and mad
   as to ourselves. Oh! think whither we are sunk, and what a sort of
   creatures we are become, and how admirable the divine patience is, that
   lets such a sort of creatures as we are, live in this world: a world
   which we did not furnish, which we did not make, and which he can in a
   breath blow away into nothing, as he raised it up out of nothing, by a
   breath the other way.

   6. See here the admirable greatness of God. Oh! how we should hence
   apprehend and adore the divine greatness! The things that are made
   clearly demonstrate his invisible power and Godhead: and do but
   consider these two things--the greatness of the things that are made
   and--how little they yet represent God. And then see what cause we have
   from hence to admire his most adorable greatness.

   (1.) How great the things are that are made. Alas, what a spot, a point
   is this earth of ours in comparison of the universe! If our thoughts
   should go no further than our own vortex, in which the sun and moon and
   planets have their course, how much more unmeasurable to our thoughts
   is that vortex than this earth of ours! This earth, in comparison of
   that vortex, is no more than a spot to the universe. It is a far less
   considerable point to the whole universe than this earth is to our
   vortex, or that circle that doth immediately encompass it. And then to
   think of the vastness of this universe; all which, and all that it
   contains are but things that are made. How mighty a One then is their
   Maker, their invisible Maker! The greatness of the creation gives us a
   great representation of the greatness of the Creator. But it adds
   unspeakably more if,

   (2.) We consider, that yet all which creation can represent unto us of
   the Divine Being, is a mere nothing in comparison of what it represents
   not: for there is a whole infinitude of being besides, that was from
   eternity, everlasting of itself. And it is but a minute effort of the
   divine eternal power that is seen in this universe: for all the
   universe is but a finite thing, as great as it can be supposed to be,
   it is still but a finite thing: but then, there is an infinity of being
   besides, that is from all eternity, the being of the invisible God.
   Take this whole created universe and it is but a shadow in comparison
   of "I AM." That Being that claims to itself the name of "I AM," and
   there is nothing besides ME; nothing fit to be called being besides my
   own: for all made being is but at will and pleasure, raised up by a
   breath and capable of being reduced to nothing by a breath. The whole
   creation, the whole universe but a bubble created by the breath of the
   Almighty; and may be let to sink again, if he please, by the retraction
   or withdrawing of that breath. If then the things made, clearly
   demonstrate the invisible things; even the eternal power and Godhead of
   their Maker, how great a one is HE, first, that could make so great a
   world as this, and yet, secondly, when that is done, it can represent
   so little of him! There is yet an infinitude of being appropriate to
   himself. Besides, how little a portion do we take up of him, as it is
   said, Job xxvi. 5-14. when we view his ways, take notice of such and
   such things in the course of nature, (as he there speaks of) how "hell
   is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering;" how "he
   stretcheth the north over the empty place," how "he collects the waters
   into the clouds, and the clouds are not rent under them: these (saith
   he) are part of his ways, but how little a portion is heard of him?"
   Oh! how great a thing were it, if we did but once learn to apprehend
   the difference between beings unmade and made, between made beings and
   the eternal unmade Being, And again,

   7. We may learn hence the impudency of the tempter, the deceiver and
   the destroyer (as much as in him lies) of the souls of men; that he
   should ever go about to make any one believe that there is not a God.
   How strange impudency is it, that he should ever presume he can make an
   intelligent mind apprehend that there is not a God, when the invisible
   things of God even his eternal power and Godhead are so clearly seen in
   the things that are made! Think of this if any of you are vexed at any
   time (as perhaps many of you may) with malicious injections from that
   wicked one, that would fain make you believe there is no God; why turn
   upon him with disdain: "Thou impudent liar, wouldest thou make me
   believe against my own eyes, against the clear apprehensions of my own
   mind? What doth not every thing I see, doth not every thing I hear,
   proclaim the Godhead to me, could there be any thing of being, any
   thing of motion, any thing of life through this whole creation, if
   there were not an original Author of all this? Doth not every being
   speak a first being, and all wisdom speak the first wisdom, and all
   love the first love, and all goodness speak the first goodness? Can any
   thing of itself come out of nothing? Nothing is more obvious to a
   considering mind (as hath been urged before) than that we can be surer
   of nothing than we are of this--that suppose nothing at all were in
   being, to eternity nothing could ever be in being. But something is in
   being now: and if that be the account that is to be given, how there
   comes to be any thing in being; that is, that there hath been something
   eternally in being, then that which was eternally in being is the cause
   of all things that are in being. The cause that was eternally in being,
   must bear proportion to the effect. If wisdom and goodness are to be
   found amongst made things, they are not nothing, you cannot say that
   wisdom is nothing, and knowledge nothing, justice nothing, for then
   there would be no difference between a wise man and a fool. If they are
   something, they could not of themselves come out of nothing; therefore
   there must have been eternal goodness, wisdom and life; that, that in
   itself lived, and lives to all eternity: for you see there are such
   things as these among what is made. Why then it is fit to retort upon
   the tempter with disdain, "Dost thou go about to make me believe,
   against the clear light of my own mind, that there is not a God, when
   it is clearly seen from the things that are made?" If there were
   nothing else, this proves the eternal Being, that there must be an
   eternal Cause that hath in it something proportionable to the visible
   effects that are to be seen, impressed even upon the things that are
   made. Characters appearing in the effect must have something
   correspondent to them in their cause, otherwise something must come of
   itself out of nothing, which is simply the most impossible thing that
   can be thought. I would only add this in the last place,

   8. Whosoever they are that do terminate their thoughts upon this
   visible world, and look no further, they resist (nay as much as in them
   is) defeat and destroy the very design of the creation. Why hath God
   made such a world as this, and set such creatures as we in it? It is,
   that this world may be an extant, continual standing representation to
   us, an evidence, a proof of his invisible eternal power and Godhead who
   made it. We have our concerns and business lying here, within this
   visible world from day to day; here we are too apt to take up our
   thoughts, our desires, our designs; they terminate upon this visible
   world. If we let them do so, if we tolerate ourselves in such a course
   as this, it is (as much as in us is) to defeat and destroy the design
   of the creation. God hath designed this visible frame of things to be
   to us a continual monument and representation of himself, but we look
   to the things that are made, and there we let our eyes stay and
   terminate, and never look through them to that which is unmade. This
   would be a like case, as if one should have a very curious perspective
   put into his hands, that was very much adorned and beautified with
   every thing of external ornature that art could confer upon it, and
   holds it in his hand, turns it this way and that, and views it on every
   side for a long time together, and then lays it aside, never looks
   through it: he would see a vast country that now appears to him nothing
   else but a dark shadow; just so men deal with this visible creation and
   frame of things; they look upon it, take notice of the variety of
   creatures that are in it, they look on every side of this visible
   world, as it doth apply itself to them and as they have opportunity to
   view the things therein: but whereas it was intended as a perspective,
   that they might look through it into the invisible eternal power and
   Godhead of him that made all: this never comes into their minds. How
   preposterous a course is this! It is little apprehended how guilty we
   make ourselves in this kind, every day, when we let our minds stay upon
   any creature of God, this or that man or woman, or house or star, (if
   we should go so high) and never think of God; while they are all made
   things, that tend to represent to us their Maker. Oh! how little is the
   end answered and considered, why we have such a frame of things set in
   view and kept in view continually before us, that we might look through
   them and adore, look up and adore, that we might through all, view and
   behold the great Author of all, and bow our heads before him. When we
   eat and drink, and never think of God, commend the food and drink, and
   never think of God; here we take up with the creature, the made thing,
   and never consider the unmade Maker of it and of us. The end is
   defeated and lost, for which this world was made and we placed in it,
   while we look not through things visible and made, unto him that is
   invisible and unmade.

LECTURE VI. [114]

   II. There are hereupon most apparent and very blamable things, about
   which it is needful that we should be expostulated with, and that we do
   expostulate with ourselves concerning them: otherwise it would be in
   vain that another should reprove us, if we be not brought by it to
   reprove ourselves; or that another should expostulate with our own
   souls. And this we should do upon that which hath been opened and
   improved in respect of such things as these: as

   1. Why are we yet so much in doubt concerning what is so clearly
   demonstrable? the invisible things of God, his eternal power and
   Godhead, which are things so clearly seen (though they are in
   themselves invisible) by visible effects, by things that are made. Why
   are our minds yet pendulous and in suspense about so very plain and
   demonstrable things? For what, can it enter into our minds to think
   this world rose up out of itself, without a Maker, out of nothing? Who
   of us can endure (if he consider) the gross absurdity of such a
   thought? And since we may so easily be at a certainty, why are we not
   at certainty in so plain a case? why do not our minds come to a
   settlement? why are they so off and on? why do we hover and halt
   between two opinions, as we did not know whether God be God yea or no?
   or whether he were to be stuck to as such? as the prophet deals with
   that people so much divided in opinion between God and Baal. But indeed
   ours would be a worse division and more absurd for if we are divided in
   our own minds in this case it must be between a God and no God. There
   was no question among them, but there was and must be some God or
   other, but only the question was, whether that God the people owned, or
   another were the God; that was all the doubt, but this is a much wider
   case, when the question is between a God and no God; and nothing can be
   more evident than the things that are made, must have had some maker
   and author; it is a comfortable thing to ourselves to feel the ground
   firm under us as to this first and deepest fundamental; a very
   comfortable thing for us to feel that it shakes not. But know withal,
   it is a very dutiful thing towards our Maker to be at a point, and not
   to be always disputing, or to have perpetual disceptations within
   ourselves about that which is prerequisite to our duty; for that
   suspends all duty, and lays a restraint upon every thing of duty
   towards him; while we waver and hover in our spirits about so plain a
   thing as this. Let us be all at a certainty, when we may be so easily
   at a certainty; as certain (as I have urged to you) about this as we
   can be of any thing whatsoever: for we can not be more certain of any
   thing than we can be of this, that we ourselves are made things; for
   whatsoever is unmade must have been from everlasting, inasmuch as
   nothing that is made but it hath received a beginning of being.
   Whatsoever i unmade must have no beginning of being, must have been
   from everlasting. But can you be surer of any thing than that you have
   not been from everlasting? You know you have not been from everlasting,
   therefore you are made things. And again; you cannot be surer of any
   thing than you are of this, that you are such a sort of made things as
   can think, as have a power of thought: you are not more sure that you
   can see, than you are that you can think, and therefore you do know and
   are sure, that you have minds and spirits about you; for you are sure
   that flesh and blood and bones cannot think: you cannot be surer of any
   thing than you are of this, that this bulk of a body of yours, cannot
   exercise a thought. Well then, if you be a made sort of thing, and you
   find you have a power of thought belonging to you, and therefore that
   you have a mind and spirit belonging to you, you must then have
   proceeded from an unmade mind and Spirit, an unmade self-subsisting
   mind and Spirit: and this is God, and can be nothing but God, this is
   all as plain as any thing is that we see with our eyes, therefore do
   not pretend to be uncertain in a matter wherein it is so easy to you to
   be at a certainty, when so much also doth depend upon it. And blame
   yourselves for this, if you have been pendulous in so plain a case
   hitherto. Why am I in doubt when I should have been loving, serving,
   fearing, and adoring this invisible Deity all this while? Why have I
   suffered doubts to hang on my mind in so plain a case? And,

   2. Let us expostulate with ourselves about this, that our apprehensions
   of the eternal God are so feeble and languid and ineffectual as they
   have been hitherto, and for the most part (the Lord knows) yet are:
   that our minds have not only been in a dubious uncertainty, but that
   the apprehensions we have had, have had so little of vitality and
   efficacy and power in them, to form our spirits and govern our way and
   course agreeably thereunto. For (as was told you by way of inference)
   there needs not only clear knowledge, but vital knowledge of the Deity.
   And now let me a little further insist upon it, that is, that there is
   something more requisite, than certainty, some what besides a certainty
   of apprehension and knowledge about it. Such things as there are to be
   superadded thereto; that is efficacy, energy, and operative power. I
   may be certain of those things that do concern me Godward, or that do
   concern me in reference to my soul, and yet feel little of efficacy and
   power in the most certain and undoubting thoughts that I can have about
   such things: that is, though I may have as great a certainty about the
   objects of my mind as I can have about the objects of sense; yet the
   objects of sense do always strike with more efficacy than the objects
   of the mind do. Experience speaks this plainly, and I need but appeal
   to every one's experience about it. I might illustrate it to you by a
   very plain and obvious instance or two, how much more the things that
   fall under present sense do affect us, than the things do that fall not
   under sense. Though we are not more certain about the one than we are
   about the other. As in reference to these bodies of ours, we are not
   more certain that we do at present feel any thing whether it be
   grateful or ungrateful to our sense than we are certain that at one
   time or other we shall die. But is there any one that doth sensibly
   fear death, and set himself thereupon to prepare for it, as he doth
   feel pain when that is upon him? Therefore I say, we do need something
   to be superadded to our certainty to enliven our apprehensions, a power
   and energy is needful to be superadded to them. As I told you before,
   we are as certain we can think, as we are certain we can see; we are
   not more sure we can see with our eye than we are sure that we can
   think with our minds: yet the things we do see with our eyes, do affect
   us more than the things we only apprehend with our minds: therefore do
   we need to have a great deal of efficacy and power superadded to the
   apprehensions of our minds concerning the invisible things of God, his
   eternal power and Godhead. And since it is plain we do need it, that
   is, that such apprehensions often lie in our minds, and work nothing;
   but the case is with us as if we had them not, as if our minds were
   vacant of such apprehensions; surely we should not lie still patient in
   such a case as this; when these apprehensions of God are -the most
   important that can have place in our minds. Why are we so pleased with
   ourselves and so much at ease concerning this thing, that our
   apprehensions of the Godhead should have so little efficacy with them
   as they have to command our spirits? It is a relievable case as well as
   there is a necessity there should be relief sought and had in it. If he
   is pleased to shine into our minds himself, then there will be efficacy
   go with our certainty; when he is pleased to strike through the
   consistent darkness that doth inwrap our hearts, and to shine into our
   hearts by giving us the light of the knowledge of his own glory, then
   there will be power in our apprehensions of the invisible God, and then
   in his light we shall see light, as in that Psalm xxxvi. 9. Therefore,
   for this should we supplicate every day more earnestly than we do for
   daily bread; "I need thy delivering influence, O Lord, to quicken dead
   notions of things that lie in my mind, that they may have power and be
   operative in me, as much as I need daily bread, and momently breath."
   This should be our sense, and with waiting and craving eyes should we
   be looking up daily and continually: for it is dutiful, that this
   should be the posture of made spirits towards the unmade Spirit, of
   produced spirits towards their great Parent, the original universal
   Spirit that is the Parent of all; that they may be continually
   maintained and held in life by vital communications from him? self,
   this he would take well: it is childlike, it is filial deportment
   towards the supreme, original, eternal Spirit, whose off spring their
   spirits are. A parent is pleased to have a child express and own his
   dependance upon him. When we cut off these spirits of ours that are
   made from the unmade eternal Spirit, this is apostacy, disloyalty; this
   is to set up ourselves and for ourselves, and no wonder if we languish
   and perish by it. And,

   3. We should expostulate with ourselves about our so frequent
   unmindfulness of the invisible eternal God, when we have so much
   occasion to mind him every hour; for the things that are made, reveal
   him to us continually: we cannot open our eyes, but we must see
   something or other that should put us in mind of God: we shall behold
   some of the made things, that should be still putting us in mind of
   their Maker, theirs and ours. And,

   4. Why are we so little conversant with God, so unconversable towards
   him, when he is continually surrounding us, compassing us about before
   and behind, in all the made things which do encompass us? God is in
   them, or they are all in him, all living, and moving, and having their
   being in him. This conversableness with God, or a disposition of spirit
   to converse with him, it imports more than bare minding of him,
   thinking of him; it carries in it an application of faith towards him.
   It is a thing that involves complacency in the nature of it, as you can
   any of you easily apprehend. I converse electively with whom or what I
   converse with, out of choice, and for a complacential inclination of my
   own mind. Oh! why is there no more of this with us towards God, the
   unmade and eternal Being, while he continually besets us in the things
   that are made, and who is nearer to us than we are to ourselves! He is
   in us if we would but look in, and meet with him, and apply ourselves
   to him. It was first the saying of a heathen, (taken up since and
   improved by many in the Christian church, both ancient and modern
   writers) "God is more inward to us, than we are to ourselves, and yet
   we will not converse with him." It was Plato's saying first. But will
   we not converse with him? How inexcusable a thing is this, his own
   creature to be a stranger to him; a creature that he made! "I that have
   made thee, (may he say) and made thee as thou art, given thee a
   reasonable, intelligent, apprehensive, immortal mind and spirit, and
   wilt thou not know me? wilt thou not converse with me? wilt thou not
   acquaint thyself with me? wilt thou not lead thy life with me?" What
   have we to say to this?

   5. Why do we not more frequently do him homage, when we dwell in a
   world that is all his? Every thing that we can use and enjoy in it, are
   all made things, and made by him, and this world that contains and
   inwraps them all, itself a made thing, and we are made things; why are
   we not more frequently doing him homage? We can take up nothing, we can
   use nothing, we can enjoy nothing in all this whole world but what he
   hath made. And what! not do him homage, deep, inward, profound homage,
   how inexcusable is this! We know we did not make or furnish this world,
   we were brought into it, placed in it, and we find ourselves supplied
   with all things necessary for our support and for our accommodation,
   suitable to that sort of being that God hath given us. And shall we not
   do him frequent homage? Suppose a man should rush into one of your
   houses and set himself by your fire-side, and make use of such and such
   provisions of your house, as he can lay his hands on, and take no
   notice of you, would you lone; bear so barbarous a usage as this? And
   is not this the very case? You come here into this world that God hath
   made, and not you; and every thing is his that you can lay your hands
   upon, or make any use of, and to take up and use this and the other
   thing, and never look up, or not often look up to him; or not look up
   with a more delightful sense of your obligation to him, than (God
   knows) is too common with us; how can we defend ourselves against our
   own thoughts, against our own reasonings in this case? And further,

   6. Why do we drive designs here in this world, apart from him, without
   reference to him? This, and that, and the other thing I do to please
   myself, or to advance myself without any thoughts of God, without any
   referring to him. I lay my designs without him; I will go to such and
   such a place, I will abide there so long, I will there do so and so, I
   will "buy and sell and get gain," when we "ought to say, If the Lord
   will, I will do so and so." He that is the Author and Lord of all this
   made world, what! do you think to move to and fro in it without
   reference to him, and drive designs for yourselves apart from him?
   Sure, the forming of a design should always be accompanied with an act
   of worship, there should still be a dedicating of our designs to him,
   as well as of ourselves: for what is plainer, than that he that is the
   Alpha, must be the Omega too? Hath he not made himself known to us by
   those conjunct titles, the first and the last? "Of him, and by him, and
   to him are all things," that he alone might have the glory. There
   should be a tribute of glory paid him, in every thing we design, and
   more especially in reference to his design. When we come to take notice
   of that great design of his, Oh! how it might make our hearts shake
   within us, to think what sort of acknowledgments God hath in this
   world, even in that part of the world that is called Christian, in
   reference to some of the great things, and even the greatest thing that
   ever was done since there was such a world in being. That is, that
   extraordinary descent of God into the world, in the person of his own
   Son, taking upon him human flesh, becoming the Emmanuel, the divine
   nature, the invisible Godhead, in the second person, uniting itself
   with the manhood. Here are acknowledgments of this made amongst us; but
   it might make our hearts shake within us, to think of what kind. That
   is, according to the usage of too many, the descent of our blessed
   Lord, the eternal Word in human flesh, they seem to think (that their
   practice expresseth) that the nativity of our Lord is not to be
   celebrated fitly, but by a debauch; they cannot fitly celebrate the
   nativity of Christ, but by being drunk. Monstrous wickedness! To think
   that the great God is to be worshipped so unsuitably to himself; when
   he is to be made the end of all things. The Former of all things; how
   is he made the end, otherwise than as he is glorified? But to glorify
   him, to pretend to glorify him by breaking his laws, by violating his
   known and most sacred precepts! By breaking the law, dishonourest thou
   God? Rom. ii. 23. That was bad enough: but it is much worse, by
   breaking the law, to dishonour God under the pretence of doing him
   honour, to think that [ honour him by so palpably dishonouring him.
   And,

   7. Why are we so prone to blame and censure the methods of his
   government over this world, which he hath made, and when by it, and the
   things in it that he hath made, he is proclaiming to us his eternal
   power and Godhead? Is he not able wisely and well to govern his own
   creation? Could he bring such a world as this out of nothing into
   being, and doth he not know what to do with it, now he hath made it,
   and how to order the concerns of it? Oh! how little is God reverenced
   as the Creator and Former of all things, when we take upon us to
   censure, and blame, and tax his doings? Why do we strive with him, when
   he gives not account of any of his matters? Job xxxiii. 13. He is far
   above it. And like it, is that xl. 2, "Shall he that contends with the
   Almighty, instruct him? He that reproves God let him answer it." What!
   for man to take upon him to reprove God, to say he might have ordered
   things better, so and so, things might have been brought about in a
   fitter season, might have been done sooner, they might have been
   compassed by fitter methods, by more suitable instruments, and the
   like. Sure we forget ourselves when we consider not, that "the
   invisible things of God, his eternal power and Godhead," are ail
   testified by the things that are made. And what! cannot "the invisible
   things of God, his eternal power and Godhead," guide and manage things
   more wisely than we? "Woe to him that strives with his Maker! Let the
   potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth." Isaiah 45. 9. Let
   them choose their match. And those many expressions we have from
   himself in the latter end of the book of Job; "Canst thou do so and
   so?" doth intimate this all along to them and to us, that unless we
   could do such and such things, unless we could lay the foundation of
   such a world as this; unless we could stretch out such another heaven,
   and form and establish such another earth, unless we could span the
   heavens with our hands, and measure the dust of the earth, and gather
   the winds in our fists, and set bounds and limits to the sea as we
   please, "You are not my match (saith God) unless you can do such and
   such things. And if you are not my match, why will you strive with me?
   why will you contend with me? why should your wisdom vie with mine, and
   your will with mine, and your interest with mine?" And again,

   8. Why do we so little covet him for our portion, who is plainly proved
   by the things that are made to comprehend, in himself virtually, all
   the perfections of this world, and formally, infinitely more? For there
   must be infinitely more in himself than is laid out on creation. Do you
   think he did exhaust himself in making such a world as this? The world
   when all is done is but a finite thing, all that is made is but finite,
   but that which is unmade is still infinite. He that comprehends in
   himself all excellency, all goodness, all perfection, created and
   uncreated, must certainly be a sufficient portion for us. The
   absolutely perfect Being, or (which is all one in Scripture) God
   all-sufficient, must be a competent satisfying portion (one would
   think) for any one. Why then do we not covet him more for our portion?
   why is this not more the sense of our souls, "Whom have I in heaven but
   thee? and who is there on earth that can come in comparison with thee?"
   "When heaven and earth are all made things and made by thee, there must
   be in thee infinitely more than in both." But when we take up with so
   mean and little things in our thoughts, inasmuch as we know it belongs
   to the Deity to be the portion and blessedness of a soul) let us
   hereupon think with ourselves, what an affront we put upon the infinite
   eternal Godhead, to think it possible for any creature to fill up his
   room. It is a most insolent affront to the infinite eternal God, to
   think that any creature can be to you instead of God: an affront that
   you can never expiate with your blood. This is to undeify him. Him,
   whom in all your thoughts you should deify, you nullify, for make him
   any thing less than God and you make him nothing. And,

   9. Why do we no more fear him as an enemy, when he hath demonstrated
   his eternal power and Godhead by the things that are made? and all the
   invisible things that belong to his nature besides, are all
   demonstrated by the things that are made? Why do we not more fear to
   have such a one for our enemy? "Fear ye not me (saith the Lord) who
   hath bounded the sea that it cannot pass: and though the waves there of
   toss themselves they cannot go over," (giving that one instance when he
   could have given thousands as great in that; Jeremiah) "what stupid
   creatures are you that you will not fear me, when ye have such an
   instance as this and thousands more always in view before you, of my
   invisible eternal Godhead, that hath in time displayed and shewed
   itself forth? And,

   10. Lastly: Why are we so prone to fear men, the creatures of God,
   while we so little fear and stand in awe of him? It is still a wrong to
   our Maker, a wrong done to God, considered under the notion of Creator.
   Look to that Isaiah li. 12. "Who art thou, that art afraid of a man
   that shall die, and the son of man that shall be as grass? and
   forgettest the Lord thy Maker, who stretched forth the heavens?"
   inasmuch as he is the Maker and Lord of all. This shews that it is an
   insolency against him and the rights of his Godhead, to place your
   supreme fear on any thing besides him. Therefore the form of speech
   there is very remarkable, "Who art thou, that art afraid of a man?" The
   form of speech is reprehensive and expostulatory, "Who art thou?" When
   people find themselves seized with any immoderate fears, they are wont
   to pity themselves, and to look upon it as an infelicity: but they
   forget it is a crime; and those words represent it as a crime, "who art
   thou that art afraid--who art thou?" what doth that signify? Why it
   signifies thus much, Thou takest too much upon thee, while thou
   thinkest thou art only to be pitied, thou dost little consider how
   faulty thou art, thou dost transpose the government, thou deposest the
   Lord thy Maker, and settest up a mortal thing upon his throne. Who art
   thou that takest upon thee at this rate, to undeify God and deify the
   creature, a mortal worm? Who art thou that turnest all things upside
   down, to depress the Maker and to exalt a little piece of animated clay
   into his place? This is very deeply to be considered, that to have our
   spirits more liable to be awed by a man, a mortal thing, than by the
   eternal immortal God. is a doing violence and a wrong to, and
   encroaching upon, the rights of the eternal Godhead. Well now, about
   such things as these we should expostulate with ourselves.

   III. I shall shut up all with some particulars of most apparent duty,
   to which we need to be exhorted in reference to what hath been hitherto
   said. As,

   1. Since "the invisible things of God, his eternal power and Godhead,"
   are so clearly demonstrable by the things that are made, let us learn
   more to contemplate these invisible things of God, in the visible
   things that we have before our eyes: and know that it is an argument of
   very great spirituality so to do. Let the examples we have in Scripture
   engage our minds more this way. To look over such psalms as psalm the
   8th. the 104th. and the 148th. all full of admiration of the works of
   God: and a great many more, with multitudes of passages of Scripture
   besides in other places; shewing how much the spirits of the saints of
   old have been exercised and taken up in admiring God upon those
   conspicuous appearances, that have been of his glory in the creation. I
   doubt there is altogether a fault among us that we so little apply our
   minds this way. But know it is our duty to be exercised in it, to take
   times on purpose to contemplate God in the creature, to behold and view
   the invisible things of God, his eternal power and Godhead, in the
   things that are made. And,

   2. Hereupon joyfully acknowledge this God for your God; considering the
   case of the blinded besotted pagans, who worship stocks and stones for
   deities, or the sun, moon, and stars; who pray to a god that cannot
   save: the generality of the more besotted of them; though it be true
   indeed, among pagans there have been those that have been much wiser
   and of more refined minds. But since it hath pleased God more expressly
   to manifest himself to you, joyfully acknowledge it, as his people of
   old have been wont to do. "Their gods are idols, the works of men's
   hands; but our God made the heavens." And as it is in that Jer. x. 11.
   "The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall
   perish from the earth, and from under these heavens." When there are
   such multitudes of fictitious deities under a doom to perish, all the
   idols of this world, and this world itself, that great idol, that is
   most set up and exalted against God; Oh! do you joyfully acknowledge
   this God for your God, that you are sure is the only living and true
   God. Our God that made the heavens; own your relation to him, walk in
   his name, as "all people will do, every one in the name of his God."

   3. Resign and devote yourselves absolutely to him, for you are made
   things, and he is your Maker. And can one have a greater right in any
   thing than that which he hath made, and made out of nothing? not given
   it an external accidental form only, but given it its whole being. And
   so is the matter between him and you. Wherefore it is to God you must
   give yourselves: give him your whole being, body and soul and all that
   you have: for it is all but made, and it is the right and property of
   him that made you.

   4. Trust in him with all your hearts, commit yourselves entirely and
   cheerfully to him. Who would scruple to do so to so kind and benign a
   Maker? for was it not in his choice and power once, whether he would
   have made you or not? was it not determinate by him? by his pleasure,
   whether you should be or not be? If you have devoted yourselves to him,
   so as to be his by choice and consent, as well as by natural right,
   know then that you have all the encouragement in the world to in trust
   and commit yourselves to him as to a faithful Creator; as the
   expression is 1 Pet. iv. 19. This is a thing not enough understood, the
   obligation that lies upon us to own God more frequently and solemnly,
   under the notion of our Creator, We think the notion wherein we should
   own him, more to be that of a Father, and as in Christ he hath been a
   Redeemer to us: but these things are not to exclude one another by any
   means. It is very true indeed, that all the interest we had in him as
   Creator, was lost and forfeited by the apostacy: but that matter being,
   by the Redeemer, made up between him and all those that, in the
   Redeemer, accept him and take him for their God, we are not now to
   think his Creatorship is to be absorbed and swallowed up in any other
   supervening notion, by any means. We are now, by redeeming grace and
   mercy, brought to that state and pass, that we may own him comfortably
   as a Creator again. So that whereas, we had lost all right and interest
   in him, as such, by our apostacy: a restitution being made, now we are
   to commit ourselves to him, as a faithful Creator. Faithfulness hath
   reference to a promise, and a covenant. We are to commit ourselves now
   to him as a Creator, under obligation. There was a covenant made at
   first, between himself and his innocent creature; that covenant was
   broken by the apostacy; so that he could be challenged upon
   faithfulness no longer. But now, that matter being composed and made up
   by the Redeemer, by a Mediator, there is a new covenant made, and now
   faithfulness hath place in reference to him as a Creator, and we are to
   own him as such, and trust in him, and commit ourselves to him as such.
   And,

   5. You should hereupon, cease from solicitude about the issue of things
   in reference to yourselves, or in reference to the whole community that
   you profess to be of, even that people that he hath in this world.
   Solicitude should cease about private and more public concerns; you
   should reckon that yourselves and all things, are in the best hands in
   which they could lie, or into which they could be put. In reference to
   things devoted yourselves, intrusted yourselves to him upon invitation;
   not presumptuously, but as being warranted and encouraged by himself.
   Then it is a wrong to him to be anxious what he will that relate to
   yourselves, you have committed yourselves to him, do with you. What!
   will he not shew mercy to the soul he hath made? Indeed, his having
   made it, if there be no expiation of sin, would have availed nothing;
   for there is a case when "he that made them would not have mercy on
   them, and he that formed. them will shew them no favour:" Isaiah xxvii.
   11. That is, when they are in rebellion against him and will not be
   reconciled to him; but when a reconciliation is brought about, and you
   have surrendered to him the soul that he hath made, it is a great
   iniquity and wrong to him to suppose, that he will not now deal with
   you as a faithful Creator. Therefore, though now you know your soul is
   lodged in flesh, and within a little while this mortal frame must drop
   in pieces and fall into the dust, yet never be solicitous what he will
   do with your soul, or what will become of it after all: you do betrust,
   you have committed it to him, who is the most absolutely perfect God,
   and the most absolutely perfect Being. All things that he hath made
   demonstrate him to be so: and who would be afraid to let his soul rest
   in the midst of infinite, immense goodness? "His soul shall dwell at
   ease:" (as it is said of one that fears God) but very faintly, and
   beneath the significancy of that expression it is rendered, Psalm xxv.
   13. "His soul shall dwell in goodness (that is the expression) who
   feareth God," shall take up its rest, sweet and pleasant rest as men
   are wont to do at night. Who would be solicitous when he is to commit
   and put his soul into the midst of immense and boundless goodness, as
   his must be who is the Author of all made things? for they all spring
   from goodness, goodness that would diffuse itself and flow arbitrarily
   and freely in such a creation as this. And,

   6. Live more adoring lives. Let us labour to habituate ourselves, our
   spirits more to adoration, seeing the invisible things of God, his
   eternal power and Godhead are continually seen in things that are made.
   Let that sentence be engraven as a motto upon each of our hearts and
   inwrought into our souls: "Come let us worship and bow down, and kneel
   before the Lord our Maker." Let every thing that serves to put us in
   mind of him, prompt us immediately to worship, and bow down the head
   before him, upon such apprehensions of God, such demonstrations of his
   love, of his power, and goodness and greatness as offer themselves to
   our view. Let us presently bow and worship, take notice and adore.

   7. Let us subject ourselves most absolutely to his government, both
   legal and providential. Doth it not belong to him to give laws to his
   creatures that are capable of government by law, that have been
   entirely and wholly made by him? Should not he give laws, even to our
   minds and to our spirits, and lay them under the obligation of his
   laws? This is sure the most reasonable thing in the world. Why should
   he not prescribe to my mind, who is himself an unmade mind, while mine
   is but a made mind? Why should not he prescribe to me how my spirit
   should work this way or that, while he is an eternal Spirit and Mind.
   My spirit that sprung from him, why should not he direct it, even by a
   law, how to think, how to dispose of my thoughts this way and that,
   when he hath given me a power to think? Why should I not use my
   apprehensive power and knowledge for him from whom I received it? He
   that knows my mould and frame, and hath given me that intelligent
   spirit that I have, shall I not keep it in perpetual subjection to him,
   receive laws from his mouth, never think my self at liberty, and in an
   indifferency to use my thoughts as I will, and let out my affections as
   I will; but all under his law? And then, as to his providential
   government, shall not he do what he will with his creatures, with the
   thing that he hath made? How reasonable is it, how just towards him and
   how good for itself to be subject to him? Then I am quiet if I can live
   under his government, to be disposed of by him as he pleaseth:
   otherwise there is a continual war between him and me: and so a
   continual war between me and myself; affection against conscience,
   passion against judgment: for there will al ways be something in me as
   long as I live, as long as I have a reasonable intelligent being, that
   will take the part of God against unreasonable rebellious passions, and
   I shall be a self-judged creature before him in his sight. And,

   8. Lastly: Let us always propound him to ourselves as the Object of our
   religion: and take pleasure in the thought of this, that we have found
   out an object of religion, which we have revealed to us, that he hath
   himself, revealed to us himself as the great and only Object of
   religion: the one indisputable One, so as no controversy remains now
   concerning it. And whereas, it is the business of all religion, to pay
   all duty to God and expect and seek all relief and felicity from him,
   let us demean ourselves towards him accordingly. And consider with
   ourselves, that in making his mind known to us, giving us to know
   himself, he hath given us to know ourselves also, so as to understand
   that being creatures, made things, we are made for another. That which
   cannot he by itself, must not be for itself: what more reasonable thing
   in all the world? Therefore, our business must be with him as the
   final, ultimate, animative Object of our religion; and that designing
   duty to him and felicity to ourselves, we have to do with him as the
   Object of religion under that twofold notion, as one that we are to
   glorify, and as one whom we are to enjoy for ever. And this now shews
   us much of ourselves. That is, shewing us what our nature and state
   are, it shews us what our end of business must be, and that is a very
   great thing. And this is, we must understand, what we were made for.
   And this being the first head of Christian religion, (indeed of all
   religion) it resolves the first question that every one is concerned to
   make to himself: What was I made for? What is the chief end of man? To
   glorify God and to enjoy him: to pay all duty to him and to expect all
   felicity and blessedness from him; and to seek it. It is thus only that
   you can come to know what you are here in this world for: and it were a
   lamentable case, to know the several powers and faculties that belong
   to our natures, and not to know what all these are for. To know I am
   such a creature, of such a mould and frame, and not to know what these
   are made for! This would be a very sad consideration to a serious and
   considering mind, if it were not to be collected and found out what
   they were made for. As if one that never saw a watch in his life before
   he finds it by casualty and chance, and sees a great deal of curiosity
   in the workmanship, yet cannot imagine what it is intended for, what it
   was made for; it stands still and he knows not how to set it going, or
   if he did, he doth not understand the use of it. Here is the case with
   an intelligent creature, a man if he should contemplate himself, and
   not contemplate his Maker, his end. Here I have a strange kind of
   being, I have a body and I have a soul inhabiting that body; but I do
   not know why such a creature as I came to have a place in the world,
   why I have such a being, what I am to do, and what I was made for. But
   now by this you come to know what it is you were made for. If you know
   you have a Maker, you must know you were made for him, to glorify him
   and to enjoy him for ever: and it is a great thing to have made this
   step; when we have taken notice of our own faculties and powers, and
   what our structure and frame are. Now to know whose we are, what
   satisfaction is it to the mind of man! to know this, that I am made to
   glorify and enjoy him that made me. But when you come to be at a loss,
   (as all in the fallen state are) "what course shall I take to glorify
   and enjoy God?" Why, we that are here wandering in such a wilderness as
   we are in, and so benighted, so bemisted as we are: if we have no
   instruction, no guidance, no rule, we are at a sad loss. Therefore it
   is the greatest joy in the world to a considering mind to have it
   plainly evidenced to him, that there is a discovery come forth from
   God, suitable to the forlorn state of the creature, a word from heaven,
   a written word that he himself hath delivered down to us, to teach us
   how we are to glorify him, and how we are to enjoy him which will be
   the next thing we shall come unto.

LECTURE VII. [115]

   2 Tim. iii. 16.

   All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.

   YOU have had an Object of religion; the only competent and deserving
   Object (I hope) with some efficacy presented to you; an absolute
   perfect Being, an eternal infinite Mind or Spirit, self-existing and
   unmade; demonstrating himself to be so, by the things that are made.
   And now the business of that religion that is to be exercised towards
   such an Object (the glorious and blessed God) is continually to render
   to him a due homage, and to expect from him blessedness for our own.
   souls. Religion stands in serious endeavours (as the learners among us
   are taught to speak and understand) "to glorify God und enjoy him for
   ever." Under this twofold notion, we are to go and act towards him as
   our chief end: as one to whom we owe all the duty we are capable of
   performing, and by per forming whereof we glorify him; and from whom
   only we must expect all the felicity we are capable of partaking of,
   and in, the participation whereof we enjoy him; so we are to consider
   and move towards God as our end, in such a motion of heart and spirit.
   This is present religion, that is, the religion of our present state.
   The religion of the way (as it is cal led) or the religion of viatores;
   those that are travelling, and yet short of their final perfection. And
   therefore is the whole of that religion, to wit, the religion of the
   present state in contra-distinction to that of the eternal state,
   expressed by a term that denotes continual motion; that is, a coming to
   God. "He that cometh to God must believe that he is." We are to be
   continually in this motion all the while we are in this world; coming
   to God. In order whereto that great fundamental is to be forelaid--the
   belief that God is; as that which is prerequisite, upon which we have
   been insisting already. "He that cometh to God must believe that he is,
   and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him." But now,
   whoso ever have it in design thus to come to God, and move towards him,
   they will find that they need a rule to guide those motions by which
   they may direct and steer their course: there is no coming to God but
   as he is pleased to render himself accessible, but as he will be
   approached; and therefore our religion which consists in this motion,
   in this coming to God, cannot be a self-devised thing, or an invention
   of our own; we cannot come to God as we please, but as he pleases, as
   he will have us come: we can never glorify him, but by doing his will,
   nor can we ever come to enjoy him but by compliance therewith.
   Therefore, this must of course be the next inquiry, with any
   considering person, any one that doth seriously design to do any thing
   in the business of religion: "What course shall I take to know God's
   will, concerning my approach, my coming, my tending towards him through
   the whole course of my life in this world?" It is a very rational
   inquiry, and that which the exigency of the case must urge every one
   to, that doth intend seriously and in good earnest to be religious. For
   admit, that there be internal principles, from the very reason and
   nature of things, truth and false hood, good and evil, right and wrong,
   yet besides that such as are needful are taken into the constitution,
   or among the determinations of the divine will, so there are other
   things super-added with respect to the varied state of our case: and it
   is the divine will that doth determine and constitute what we shall do
   in this course of our motion towards him, and consequently what shall
   be required of us to believe and know that we may so do, and so we do
   need a signification of his will concerning our faith, and concerning
   our practice. Though it is true, that the determinations of his will
   are riot (as to the most principal things that do concern us)
   arbitrary, but they are determinations of his will, according to most
   excellent wisdom, most perfect judgment, and counsel, for he "worketh
   all things according to the counsel of his own will;" and so doth will
   such things concerning us, and in reference to us, as the state of our
   case doth require and need, and without which there could be no
   commerce restored, and brought about between him and us. And now,
   whatsoever will express and signify to us the divine will about such
   things as will be our fit and useful rule to guide our motion towards
   God as our end, we are to seek after. And concerning this, the inquiry
   must needs be made by every serious person; "What is there that I may
   look upon, as such a sufficient signification to me, of the divine will
   touching my great concernments with him? "Now we have a book among us,
   that calls itself, and is commonly styled THE WORD OF GOD. This very
   book, if it be not the word of God, truly, to call it so, and to
   attempt and endeavour to spread it as such, is one of the boldest
   cheats that ever was attempted to be put upon the sons of men. But if
   really and truly it be so, then it doth our business: you find it doth
   so, by looking into it, for this is the business it doth profess, and
   the intent which it doth own and avow, to acquaint us with the divine
   will and pleasure in order to our serving and glorifying him, and being
   finally happy and blessed with him. If it be his will indeed, it will
   most undoubtedly serve for this end and purpose; that being all the end
   that professedly it hath to serve. Nothing can so well serve this
   purpose as his word, if there be such a word: for who can so well tell
   us what God's will is, as he himself? Sure he best knows his own mind,
   and what judgment he hath made of things, and which (after him) he will
   have us to make, in order to our practice.

   I might (indeed) have driven the inquiry a great deal further into the
   principles of religion, upon a merely rational ground, or according to
   the ducture of natural light; as it was necessary to be done, upon what
   hath been clone already, in representing and evidencing to you an
   object of religion: which was necessary first to be proved, before we
   could with any colour of reason go about to assert the divine authority
   of this book. It would have been a very absurd thing to go about to
   prove from this book, the authority of it, that there was such a thing
   when he which should give that authority, and from whom that authority
   should be derived, should be unknown to us; or it should be a matter of
   doubt with any, whether there was such a one, yea or no. But that being
   once proved and out of question, now it comes in the proper and natural
   method, and next of course to be considered: Is there such a revelation
   from this God, as this book doth pretend to? hath it really that divine
   stamp upon it from him, which by those who do profess and own
   themselves christians, it is apprehended to have? And if that can be
   found, it supercedes any need of following the line of natural light
   (as such) further; because there is nothing more now to be discovered
   that way, which Is not more clearly and fully contained in this hook.
   And therefore all other things that might he referred thither, I shall
   rather satisfy myself to deduce and insist upon as they come in our way
   from thence. In order whereto, our first business must be to assert the
   authority of them. And for that purpose it is, I have pitched upon this
   passage of Scripture, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God."
   All Scripture is theopneustos. It is only that one word that is said of
   it, God-breathed. All Scripture is (as it were) the breath of God. That
   indeed is the very literal sense of the word here used, breathed from
   God.

   And so the words are a formed proposition to our hands, we need not
   vary them in any other phrase, but take them as they lie. Our business
   must be to assert, from them,--The Divine Authority of the Scriptures.
   Jn order whereto, I shall premise,

   First: That I design not herein to meddle with divers lesser collateral
   questions, as touching the Hebrew points, and He brew translations, the
   various readings, etymological and other differences, which are things
   much fitter for the schools than for the pulpit. And therefore,

   Secondly: My main design must be to evince to you, that this book doth
   contain it; it a sufficient revelation of the divine mind and will,
   touching what we are to believe and do in order to our glorifying God
   as our supreme Lord, and our enjoying him, and being happy in him as
   our best and only satisfying good. And in order hereunto, the course
   that will be fittest to take, will in short be this--To state the
   subject to you that is spoken of under the name of Scriptures, with its
   universality, "all Scripture:" and then--To prove to you from that
   subject, the thing affirmed of it, that it is God-breathed, that it is
   inspired from God, or (which is all one) that it is of divine
   authority, and that God is the Author of it.

   I. For the stating of the subject here spoken of, Scripture, with a
   universal term, "all Scripture;" that universal term can not he
   absolutely universal, (as you may be sure) cannot signify all writing.
   Every writing cannot be pretended to be God-breathed, or of divine
   inspiration; therefore the limitation of this universal term is to be
   taken from the immediately foregoing words, "From a child thou hast
   known the holy Scriptures." It is therefore holy Scripture that is here
   spoken of. All holy Scripture, the whole of that which is called holy
   Scripture; it is of divine inspiration. Well, what is that, that is
   here called holy Scripture? Undoubtedly it must he that which in those
   days was immediately known by the name of the Scripture, and many times
   the Scriptures: nothing was more familiar with our Saviour, when he was
   conversant here on earth, than to speak of this book by the name of
   Scripture, and sometimes the Scriptures as being so in the most famous
   and eminent sense, according to the account that went of that part of
   them, among the Jews, of whom he was one, and among whom he conversed.
   Every one knew none could be ignorant what was meant by the Scriptures
   at that time, or in those days: "Search the Scriptures, for in them ye
   think ye have eternal life:" (saith our Saviour, John v. 39.) And this
   and that was done (as you often find in the evangelist historians) that
   the Scripture might be fulfilled. And the Scripture cannot he broken,
   saith our Lord, in one of his contests with the Jews. John x. 35. Now
   it is very evident here,

   1. Therefore, by the Scriptures, that is, holy Scriptures (a? the
   apostle's words in this place do expound themselves) must be meant the
   books of the Old Testament. That (I say) in the first place must be
   meant by it, which then by universal consent among that people, went
   under the name or notion of the Scriptures. That is, those books of the
   Old Testament which go with us at this day under that notion, and come
   into that censure and account, without the apocryphal books which never
   came into that account among the Jews, and therefore are justly left
   out of that account with us. They never took them. The ancient
   christians did not take them into that account at all, nor the Jews
   before our Saviour's time, or at any time: they were not written in the
   Hebrew tongue (unless some little parts) as the books of the Old
   Testament were; and have many things very fabulous in them, that shew
   them to have proceeded from human authority; though divers of them
   (some of those books at least) proceeded from very pious writers. After
   that, the full compute of these books of the Old Testament was gathered
   up and digested by Ezra since the captivity. It was very plain the Jews
   never took any writing into the account of canonical Scriptures from
   the time they took in the prophecy of Malachi; never after that, did
   they add any thing to the sacred canon, and so much we find Josephns
   against Appion most expressly to tell us. And therefore the apocryphal
   writings could be none of the books that went under the name of the
   Scriptures here, when the apostle saith, "all scripture is given by
   inspiration of God:" nor indeed, did they come into that account in the
   Christian church in the purest times. The account that is given us of
   the Scriptures by Origen and Athanasius leaves these books quite
   excluded: though we have an account too in ancient records of some use
   made of them as certain ecclesiastical books, but not as the holy
   Scriptures; they were not accounted the holy books. That then is part
   of this subject here to be spoken of, when it is said, "all scripture
   is given by inspiration of God," that is, the books of the Old
   Testament, which was the Scripture in the eminent sense at that time.
   But,

   2. There comes within the compass of this subject too, the books of the
   New Testament. For we must consider about what time this was written by
   the apostle to Timothy; this was the second epistle you see; and that
   was most certainly written a considerable time after the greatest part
   of the New Testament was written. You. may take notice in the next
   chapter, (2 Tim. iv. 6.) that he speaks of the time of his departure
   being near at hand. He had once appeared before Nero already, and we
   are told that this was written near about the time of his appearance
   before Nero the second time: so we have it in the conclusion of this
   epistle, that is, in the adjunct to it. And though those subjoined
   adjuncts to the epistles, are not always of unquestionable authority,
   yet the matter of this epistle leading so much thereto, it puts this
   thing out of doubt that this was written very near the close of the
   apostle's life, "I am ready to be offered," saith he, "and the time of
   my departure is at hand." Now it is evident that all the gospels were
   written a considerable time before this. The last of them, undoubtedly,
   was the gospel of John, and that he is supposed to have wrote about the
   eighth year of Nero, whereas the apostle suffered (as we are told by
   history) in the last year of Nero about seven years afterwards. So that
   in all likelihood this was the last, or the last save one, that he
   wrote of his epistles; Paul here speaking of the time of his departure
   as near at hand: and we find that what was written by him, is elsewhere
   referred to, under the name of Scripture: as by the apostle Peter (2
   Pet. iii. 15, 16.) where he speaks of his "beloved brother Paul" who
   had "many things in him hard to be understood, which," saith he,
   "ignorant and unstable minds wrest, as they do other scriptures to
   their own destruction," and we find the apostle James in his 4 chap. 5
   ver. refers, under the name of Scripture, to another passage of his
   "the spirit in us" (as saith the Scripture) "lusteth to envy." You find
   nothing any where to answer this but that Gal. v. 17 There, having
   spoken of envy, particularly before, he addeth, "thefk-sh lusteth
   against the spirit." And whatsoever was to come within that character
   and sacred stamp must come within the compass of this subject too. The
   book of the revelation plainly shews it was written by the apostle John
   when he was in Patmos: and after his return from thence, history
   informs us, that upon the request of the Asiatic churches, he did
   collect and gather together and put into order all the books of the New
   Testament, and so (as it were) did seal up the canon. And a
   considerable time after that, we are informed of his taking a journey
   to---- [116] on purpose to collect the Sacred Writings he found among
   the churches there, with whom, he conversed: and he there found the
   books punctually as we have them, and in the same order wherein they
   now stand in our Bibles. And in the fourth century, they were all
   recognised by the council of the Laodiceans; therefore at this time,
   when this epistle to Timothy was written, there must be understood to
   be a reference had to all the books of the New Testament already
   written, and any to be written by inspiration of the same Spirit. And
   so this makes up together, the subject here spoken of, when it is said
   "all Scripture," all holy Scripture "is given by inspiration of God."
   All God-breathed, (as it were) breathed from heaven, the issue of
   divine breath, for those great and glorious purposes that it was to
   serve in this world. And now,

   II. We come to prove the thing affirmed concerning this subject--that
   these Scriptures were inspired from heaven, by God himself, or are of
   divine authority; which is the import of this assertion, as to the way
   of God's communicating his mind to those that delivered them. The
   expression is large and extensive enough to comprehend any, wherein
   there might be a certain signification of the divine will, whether he
   did communicate it by voice, (as he did divers things we find upon
   record in Scripture) or whether it was by dream, or by vision, to the
   penman, that is, asleep or waking: or whether it were (as the Jews
   distinguish) by immediate irradiation of the intellect, the
   understanding faculty: or whether it were by impression or signature
   upon the imagination or fancy, as a thing intervening between the
   divine mind and the intellect; which way so ever it was, the expression
   will reach it. It was of divine authority; it proceeded from him, be it
   one or the other of these ways. And in order to the evincing of this by
   argumentation, I shall briefly say somewhat to justify the undertaking,
   of proving the divine authority of these Scriptures by that
   argumentative way: and then shall proceed to the proof thereof, in that
   way which the case itself doth best admit of.

   1. Something may be needful to be said to justify the undertaking to
   prove the divine authority of these writings, in a way of
   argumentation. In order to it, do but note these two things.

   (I.) That undoubtedly there can be no effectual believing of the things
   contained in the Scriptures, unto salvation, without the special
   operation of the divine Spirit. It is only the Spirit that makes the
   sanctifying impression of these Scriptures upon the soul. The apostle
   expresses his great thankfulness to God, on the behalf of the
   Thessalonian churches (2 Thes. ii. 13) that "God had chosen them to
   salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the
   truth." There is no sanctifying belief of that truth but by the divine
   Spirit; that is out of all question: "Sanctify them by thy truth, thy
   word is truth:" John xvii. 17. "Do thou sanctify them by it: the
   sanctifying them by this truth, or by the truth of this word of thine,
   must be thine own work." There is that vicious prejudice in the minds
   of men, against the design and tendency of all sacred truth, and that
   power of corrupt inclination, to comply and comport there with, that it
   must be a great power that must overcome; and none is great enough that
   is inferior to the power of the Almighty Spirit. It is by a certain
   spirit of faith in the soul that men do believe to the saving of their
   souls. "We, having the same spirit of faith, believe and therefore
   speak." There is none can arrive to this belief, a divine belief of the
   Scriptures, without the operation of that Spirit. This very notion, in
   general, that the Scriptures are the word of God, is a dead and insipid
   and ineffectual thing: as all other notions of truth comprehended in
   that general are also. But,

   (2.) I must add, that the operations of the divine Spirit are not
   necessary to bring men under an obligation, or to make it become their
   duty to believe the Scriptures to be God's word, or of divine
   authority: which therefore certainly doth infer, that there is a way of
   proving this by argument, that these Scriptures are of divine
   authority, so as to hold men under an obligation to believe them to be
   God's word; that it becomes their duty to believe them so, so that they
   are culpable if they do not, if that light that may shine into. them
   that way about this matter be not received and comported with
   accordingly. And to evidence this briefly to you, do but consider these
   things:

   [1.] If there be not enough to be said by way of argument to prove the
   divine authority of this sacred book, without the special immediate
   operation of the divine Spirit, then every one that hath not the
   operation of the divine Spirit, would be innocently an unbeliever under
   the gospel. Then it would he an innocent thing to be an infidel under
   the gospel, notwithstanding the clearest light that can be supposed to
   shine amongst us, supposing only the absence of the special influence
   of the divine Spirit: and then the mere retraction or withholding of
   that influence, would be enough to justify the infidel and to make him
   therefore not guilty of a crime in his infidelity, barely because he
   hath not that Spirit; than which, nothing can be supposed more absurd
   or more prejudicial to the Christian cause and interest.

   [2.] This is to be considered too, (to the same purpose) that if the
   special operations of the Spirit, were necessary to make it become a
   man's duty to believe these Scriptures to be the word of God, then they
   must be necessary in reference to every particular thing which he shall
   be bound to believe. But you know, the whole is made up of all the
   parts: and when we speak especially of the necessary parts, it is
   plain, that if the operation of the Holy Ghost be necessary to make it
   a man's duty to believe these Scriptures, it must be necessary in order
   to his believing every more principal part, every sentence that doth
   more immediately and directly, concern the salvation of his soul; and
   then upon that supposition, every person that should be under an
   obligation to believe these Scriptures to be the word of God, must
   himself be an inspired person or a prophet. And then, this would be the
   consequence, that these Scriptures would be of no use at all, one way
   or another; not to them that have the Spirit of faith to enable them to
   believe them; because every thing that is contained in them, and
   necessary for the end for which they are written, must be supposed to
   be suggested and dictated to them by that Spirit, and therefore the
   believer would have no need of the Scripture; and to the unbeliever
   they would be no use at all, because while the Spirit doth not give his
   influence to make them believe, they (upon this supposition) never
   could believe. And therefore, consequently, the Scriptures would be of
   no use, do no good, either to believer or unbeliever. And therefore, as
   I have asserted in the first place, that there can be no effectual
   believing of these Scriptures unto salvation, without the sanctifying
   influence of the divine Spirit, so I further do assert, that such an
   influence of the divine Spirit, is not necessary to make it become a
   man's duty to believe these Scriptures; but it will be his duty to
   believe them upon such light about this matter, as may in an
   argumentative way be supplied and furnished unto any that will make it
   their business attentively to consider. And now,

   2. In the second place, I shall proceed to tell you in whatway this
   proof must be attempted and undertaken, that is, inasmuch as the
   subject here, Scripture, all Scripture, is so complete as you have
   heard: that is, is made up of the books of the Old Testament and the
   New. The method that is reasonable to be taken, is to endeavour to
   evince these two things to you, that there were Scriptures in our
   Saviour's and the apostles' lime, and many of them a great while
   before, which were certainly of divine authority: and that the books
   which we now have among us, in our time and in our hands, are the
   self-same books, in substance, (without any material corruption or
   alteration) that those were, which went for the holy Scriptures, of
   divine authority at that time. These are the two things that are to be
   evinced and made out to you, and with such evidence as may leave little
   ground or pretence of cavil to the understanding and honest christian:
   which I doubt not (through the blessing of God) may be done.

LEC. VIII. [117]

   (1.) Now to prove that these books in the days of our Saviour and his
   apostles, even unto the last of them, went into the account of those
   Scriptures that were of divine authority: and within this compass, must
   come the books of the Old and New Testament. We shall give some
   considerations in reference to this; and shall afterwards in the close
   of all, (having spoken to the latter proposition too) give you some
   additional considerations concerning this book as now we find it.

   [1.] For the divine authority of the books of the Old Testament, I
   shall not trouble you here with the various divisions that the Jews
   made of these books. And here, whereas, they reckon no more of them,
   than there were letters of their alpha bet, two and twenty, which most
   apparently excludes the apocryphal books. It would be tedious and
   trifling to trouble you with the account how they did severally refer
   all those to the several letters; only it is plain that the minor
   prophets they made all but one book. But this division only will serve
   our turn (though they did not strictly hold to it, but varied from it
   commonly, making a third member which we find no mention made of in the
   evangelists, or the writings of the New Testament,) that is, the
   division of the books of the Old Testament into those of Moses and the
   prophets. The Jews indeed made the Hagiographia, or third class, that
   is, accounting none prophetic, but those which were sent by special
   mission from God. And so all those books (besides the five books of
   Moses, and those written by Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the minor
   prophets,) they called Hagiographia, that is, other holy writings,
   sacred writings; such as the historical parts of Scripture, the books
   of Job, Proverbs, Canticles, Ecclesiastes and the like. But our Saviour
   comprehends all under the name of the law and the prophets, or
   sometimes, Moses and the prophets: (Mat. xxii. 40.) "On these two hang
   all the law and the prophets:" and that other place (Luke xvi. 29.)
   "they have Moses and the prophets." Now take here the books of Moses
   first, and there can be no doubt at all but he was an inspired person,
   and that his books were written by very peculiar inspiration. If you do
   but admit the truth of the historical relation, as to him, and that
   people he had the conduct of, I say, supposing that there can be no
   doubt of his having written those books by special inspiration of God,
   for (admitting the truth of the history) you find how familiarly
   conversant he was with God, from time to time; that he did nothing of
   any concernment in reference to that people, but always by divine
   monition. Nothing then is more unsupposable than that he should do so
   great a thing as this, digest such records, and stamp them with the
   name of sacred and divine, and call them the word of the Lord, and the
   law of the Lord; and all this, without special instinct from God. Do
   but think how manifest and observable and adorable a divine presence,
   shewed himself to that person. How peculiarly God took him nigh to
   himself, sustained him forty days and forty nights together, (whether
   once or twice I will not here dispute) in the sacred mount, by miracle;
   sup porting him by his own glory, speaking to him from time to time,
   giving him free recourse to him, directing him to consult him, and take
   his responses from him, upon all occasions. And that the history that
   relates to him, as to the matter of fact, must be true beyond all
   exception is evident if you consider, such things as these:

   First. The very honourable mention that is made of this Moses, and some
   of the most remarkable things relating to that people (the Jews) whom
   he had the conduct of, by some of the most ancient and celebrated pagan
   writers, magnifying him as a most wise and prudent legislator, and a
   very great man; and remarking very considerable things with reference
   to this people. I need not trouble you with them; it is known to
   scholars, what of this kind is written by Diodorus Siculus and others.
   And,

   Secondly. That which is above all demonstration: it is notorious to all
   the world that the people of the Jews were under the government of a
   Theocracy for several centuries of years successively, which puts the
   matter out of all doubt, that the history of that fact must be
   unquestionable upon which they became so. They were continually
   directed by God himself; their laws were made by God himself. He
   appointed the means of being consulted in every place, and it was
   through a long continued series of time: and so these records in all
   that time were known to be sacred things, having a divine stamp all
   along upon them. And again,

   Thirdly. It is to be considered that the very matter of the history
   itself (considered in its circumstances) doth speak its own truth:
   considered, I say, in its circumstances, that is, the bringing of the
   people of Israel out of Egypt, and bringing them out by so strong a
   hand, inflicting so many miraculous plagues upon that Egyptian people
   and their prince, till they were forced to a manumission of them: the
   dividing of the red sea, the most stupendous way of giving the law upon
   mount Sinai, which (with the additional precepts that were given to
   Moses in the mount itself) make up (you know) the most considerable
   parts of the Pentateuch. The very matter of itself speaks, (if you
   consider it clothed with its circumstances) that there could be no
   fiction as to these things; for there is nobody but must grant, upon an
   ordinary view and judgment of those characters that do appear of Moses,
   that he was a prudent man at least, a very prudent man. But certainly
   he must needs be a madman that would report a fiction of things said to
   be done by, and before six hundred thousand men. When men do feign and
   forge things, they do it with the greatest privacy imaginable. As the
   portentous stories about Mahomet, there are no witnesses quoted, but
   all goes upon the credit of his word. It is not said, there were such
   and such thousands that saw such and such things, for then, if it were
   false, it were the easiest thing in the world to be disproved. Now when
   the law is said to be given from such a mount, clothed with so terrible
   and august a glory at that time, and the voice heard uttering those ten
   words, as they are called, by six hundred thousand men, at once,
   besides women and children, (for these words are said to be heard
   spoken from the mount, by all the people; whereupon they could not bear
   that God should speak to them any longer. "We die," say they to Moses,
   "if God speak to us any more, but do thou speak and we will hear,") no
   man that hath but the ordinary understanding of a man, can think, that
   one of common prudence would inform of things that he saith were done
   in view of so many thousands of witnesses, if they were not done; if
   there were any design in saying so, that design were presently blasted,
   and lost out of hand; especially if it be considered that among those
   ten words there are so express precepts against idolatry; and that
   people had so marvellous propensions to idolatry, as their frequent
   relapses into it, and their running into it, even in Moses' absence,
   when God ceased to speak with an audible voice, do testify, It had
   given them the most gladsome opportunity they could have wished for,
   could they have detected a fraud in the case. When it is said there
   were such and such, and so many thousand witnesses, they could have
   said, there was no such thing. Could not this have been transmitted to
   posterity for a notorious cheat? by a people so prone to idolatry as
   they were. And when they were urged by the prophets (in a time of great
   degeneracy) with the authority of the divine law, how easily could they
   have replied, "No, there was no such law, it was a fiction, and what is
   said to be given by God's voice; and our fathers are said to be quoted
   as witnesses to, they all renounced it, said there was no such thing?"
   And then,

   Fourthly. That holy men succeeding this time, (and unto whose
   inspiration it hath been sufficiently attested, as we shall see
   afterwards,) did attest unto Moses, still calling that law written by
   him, the law of the Lord, and the word of the Lord, and the testimonies
   and statutes of the Lord. With what reverence and with what delight and
   complacency do you find them so mentioned in the book of Psalms, in
   multitudes of places, when there was little else of Scriptures yet
   extant, besides those books of Moses? Would such a man as David, with
   adoration have called these writings, the law of the Lord, and the
   word, and statutes and judgments and testimonies of the Lord, if they
   had not been most certainly so? And would he have expressed so high
   delight in them, and veneration for them as such, counting them more
   precious than thousands of gold and silver, and expressing the
   heart-breakings and longings of his soul after them from time to time
   upon all occasions? And then, for what was written by him (David) and
   other holy men, (besides the prophets) though it is not known who wrote
   every book, yet there is no doubt but all may (as our Saviour did
   design they should) be comprehended under the name of the prophets;
   Moses and the prophets. And for the prophets, that they were reckoned
   prophets speaks their inspiration; the distinguishing character of true
   prophets and false, being so well known among that people. And for the
   things themselves that they prophesied, the accomplished events did
   from time to time prove the inspiration of the prophets.

   But then take the whole Old Testament together, and that hath received
   its confirmation abundantly from the New: so that if the New can be
   proved to be of divine authority, all our business is done, the matter
   is out of question. The whole Old Testament, it is most expressly owned
   and proved by the New. For,

   What is the New Testament, but a commentary upon the Old? it is an
   application of the religion of the Old Testament. The Old was nothing
   but a veiled gospel. The New is nothing else but the same gospel
   unveiled. And again,

   It is plain, that our Lord himself doth frequently and expressly
   confirm to us the whole Old Testament, taken together under the name of
   Scripture, or the Scriptures, Moses and the prophets, and the law and
   the prophets. As when he saith "I am not come to destroy the law: no, I
   am not come to destroy but to fulfil:" (Matth. v. 17) and in the next
   verse "Heaven and earth shall pass away before one jot or one tittle of
   the law pass"--so that he hath confirmed the whole Old Testament to a
   tittle, to a very tittle, not one tittle but is sacred, it cannot be
   lost, cannot pass away, it is a more stable thing than heaven itself,
   and therefore now,

   [2.] We pass to the books of the New Testament. And how will it appear
   that there were such books written by divine inspiration, so as we
   ought to reckon the authority of them is stampt thereon by God himself?
   Why,

   First. Much of what we find in these writings was delivered by our Lord
   himself. The most material things contained in the gospels, that is,
   the doctrinal parts, were his own words still from time to time, upon
   all occasions.

   Secondly. It is very plain that he did inspire his apostles, that were
   to be witnesses of him, and whose business it must be to be planters
   and propagators of the Christian faith after wards in the world. He did
   purposely inspire and direct and authorise them to publish those very
   things that make up the substance of those books; and therefore, no
   doubt, did direct them to write those very books themselves; for who
   can suppose, he having a design that the Christian religion should
   obtain and take place in all succeeding times to the end of time, but
   that he should intend that it should be wrote, it should be put into
   writing, and therefore when he laid that charge upon his apostles, upon
   whom he breathed at parting, or a little before, saying "Receive ye the
   Holy Ghost," and to whom he gave this charge, "Go and teach all nations
   this doctrine;" certainly within the compass of that charge must be
   comprehended the charge of writing these things, as -one means of
   publishing them to all nations, and so necessary a means, as that all
   besides (as to succeeding ages) must be ineffectual. And then,

   Thirdly. For the authority of what was contained in these books, or the
   divinity thereof, he did endow those he made use of, as his apostles
   and first planters of the Christian faith after him, (even their very
   inspiration itself, their very mission as well as the several parts of
   that message upon which they were sent) with a power of working
   stupendous miraculous works: that it might be seen by all men, that a
   divine power did at test to divine truth, as it was published by those
   men. And upon this you find that mighty stress laid, that these first
   propagators of the Christian faith, "preached the gospel with the Holy
   Ghost sent down from heaven," And the same Holy Ghost that did assist
   them in preaching, did prompt too, to write the whole New Testament.
   And that it was the Holy Ghost that did actuate them in all this, was
   shewn by that power of working miraculous works, which God gave at the
   same time; because the Holy Ghost is entitled to those works by our
   Saviour himself, saying, "If I by the Spirit of God cast out devils,
   then is the kingdom of God come unto you," then is that religion true,
   and it is the kingdom of God that I am here setting up among you, and
   hereupon is that great weight laid upon this matter, (Heb. ii. 2. 3.
   4.) "If the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression
   and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; how shall we
   escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to
   be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard
   him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and
   divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own
   will?" This was the divine seal, the seal of heaven affixed to these
   writings and what was contained in them: that is, that when men should
   come abroad upon such an errand, into strange countries and other
   nations besides their own, and speak things that such and such people
   had never heard of before, hereupon, suppose it should be inquired of
   them, "What shall induce us to believe, that what you say is true and
   comes from God?" Why immediately they do such and such works that could
   only be done by divine power, and so they testify to men, that this was
   a divine truth that they uttered to them. They preached such a gospel,
   and at the same time they healed the sick, by the speaking of a word,
   and sometimes raised the dead to life, as our Saviour himself did, who
   had so confirmed the truth before, by that and other most wonderful
   things that referred to his own person, by his death especially, and by
   his resurrection. Here was the greatest question among the Jews: he
   gave himself out to be the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God; all the
   question was, "Is this the Christ, or is he a deceiver or impostor?" He
   must be one of the two: either the Christ as he said he was, or one of
   the most notorious impostors that ever was upon the face of the earth:
   all the dispute rested upon this one thing: "Whereas, he gave himself
   out to be the Son of God, is he the Son of God or no?" The means by
   which many were wrought upon before his death, to believe in him, were
   his most miraculous works; but I say they were but the means: and to
   bring any effectually to believe in Christ, there must be something
   more than external means. When he preached to the multitude, he
   confirmed his word, sometimes by feeding thousands by very
   improportionable means; by healing the sick, by opening the ears of the
   deaf and the eyes of the blind, loosening the tongues of the dumb, and
   raising up the dead to life and the like: and when at length he came to
   die, you know with what circumstances his death was accompanied; all
   the powers of heaven and earth were shaken, the sun withdrew his head,
   the veil of the temple was rent, the dead arose; and a poor pagan
   centurion, (who was appointed to guard the execution) upon sight of
   these things gives up the cause; "Verily this was the Son of God, I see
   he was in the right, the Jews persecuted him wrongfully," (for here was
   the question between them, Was he the Son of God or no?) "They
   crucified him for a blasphemer, in saying he was the Son of God, which
   they denied him to be, but now I see he was the Son of God." And he was
   afterwards "declared to be the Son of God with power, by the Spirit of
   holiness by which he was raised from the dead." Now his apostles' going
   forth, in the authority of this divine Person, to testify nothing but
   what they saw with their eyes, and what they heard with their ears, and
   being appointed by him to be witnesses of what they saw and heard, and
   to preach the doctrine which he had preached and delivered to them
   before; and they themselves working so miraculous works to prove the
   truth of what he did assert; this proves the matter out of all
   question, that what was written concerning all this, must be by divine
   inspiration. And further too,

   Fourthly. It manifestly appears how the prophecies of the Old Testament
   (the greatest and most important of them) did receive their
   confirmation that they were divine, by the events that fell out in the
   time wherein the books of the New Testament were written, and which
   came to be reflected on after wards, by the wisest and most
   considering, thesuitableest and most competent judges the world had in
   those days. Many of them were hereupon converted to the Christian
   faith: and some others that were not so, merely as wanting that
   opportunity to be informed of matters of fact which the others had had,
   who yet did acknowledge the convictiveness of the Mediator: as for
   instance, those prophecies concerning Christ, and that one express one,
   among the rest, of Daniel, about the seventy weeks: that great pagan,
   (and one of the most considerable enemies for reason and learning that
   ever the Christian cause had in the world) Porphiry, having opportunity
   to view over this prophecy said, it must needs have been written after
   the event, it was so very punctual. So that he only wanted an
   opportunity to know, that this prophecy had been written above five
   hundred years before his time, and was four hundred and twenty years
   before its accomplishment, in the. hands of the Jews, and kept so safe
   that it was impossible to be a fallacious thing. And therefore, that
   being his case, (he being a heathen and not a jew and not having
   opportunity to know) that must (by his own confession) be the only
   reason of his not being a believer, upon that one single prophecy, so
   punctually accomplished by the coming of our Lord; and his being cut
   off at such a time as the prophecy did say concerning the coming of the
   Messiah, the Prince, and that he was to be cut off at such a time.
   Well, upon all this there is little doubt to be made as to the first
   proposition, that is,--that those books that went under the name of
   Scripture, or the Scriptures, in our Saviour's and the apostles' time,
   to the last survivor of them, were certainly of divine authority.

   (2.) But now to the second proposition--that this book that we have now
   in our hands, containing such and such writings in it, is the same, or
   those Scriptures are the very same that were so owned and acknowledged
   for the Scripture, in those days. It may be said, and no doubt will be,
   by any that shall consider, that if this IDC out of question, the whole
   business is out of question: for nobody can think, if all that hath
   been said be true, about these books of the Old and New Testament,
   (said to be extant together at least within the time of the evangelist
   John) as to matter of fact, as Was reported, but these books must
   unquestionably be of divine authority. But how should we do to know
   that we have the matter of fact rightly deduced and drawn down to us,
   and so that we have reason to believe the books that we now have are
   the same? If we could be sure they are the same, it would be
   unquestionable: now as to that, there is one thing that I must premise
   to you, and it carries its own evidence with it. That is, that that
   knowledge that men may "have of any thing by ordinary means, we are
   never to expect should be given us by extraordinary. Pray do but take
   this, and weigh it well, as a thing needful here to be forelaid.
   Whatsoever may be sufficiently evidenced by ordinary means, it is very
   unreasonable to expect, that God should afford extraordinary means for
   the evidencing of that thing. If you do but observe the constancy of
   his methods of government, over this world, how sparing lie hath been
   of doing extraordinary things, that ought to come by just account into
   the class of miracles, of miraculous works, you would see, that the
   divine wisdom and power have been always very sparing of doing such
   things, unless where the exigency of the case did require it, and where
   the end was not otherwise attainable. But it is foolish, to think that
   the wisdom of God and the power of God should be exerted upon no
   necessity: what is it for? only to please curiosity? That which is done
   not to answer necessity, can only be supposed to be done to please and
   gratify curiosity. Now to think that the wisdom of God, should make
   infinite power, ever and anon, to stoop to do miraculous works, only to
   please and gratify a vain and curious humour, without any need, this
   were the most unworthy of God of any thing we could suppose: and
   therefore, this is never to be looked for. If then there be sufficient
   ordinary means to beget a certainty concerning this, it would be a very
   foolish thing to expect that miracles should be wrought to prove it to
   us at this day, that these books we now have are, for substance, the
   same that those were, which were owned for divine, in Christ's and the
   apostles' days. For if any one would assert, that it was needful a
   miracle should be wrought to this purpose, to assure us that these
   books were the same they were in former times; I would know who it is
   that should have opportunity of seeing this miracle? Must every one
   that should be obliged to believe these books to be the same, see such
   a miracle wrought himself? That were to make miracles more necessary
   than ever they were, for even in Christ's and his apostles' days, it
   was never thought necessary that every person should have the sight of
   a miracle himself, but it was enough that it was notoriously known that
   such and such miracles were done. But if it were not thought necessary
   in Christ's and his apostles' days, that miracles should be wrought in
   the sight of every person, that every one for his own satisfaction
   should hare the sight of such a miracle himself, then the testimony of
   such persons must be relied upon in this case, as it would be supposed
   could have no inclination or design to deceive others, by
   misrepresenting things to them: and that is such a testimony as upon
   which all matters among men do depend. "It is said in your law, (saith
   our Saviour to the Jews) the testimony of two witnesses is true;" that
   is, is credible, is not to be doubted: the whole frame of government
   depends upon witnesses. There would be no law, no justice, no society
   kept on foot in the world, if the testimony of credible witnesses were
   not to be respected and attended to. Now if in this way, there must be
   reliance on credible witnesses somewhere, that is, if some few should
   in our own time see a miracle done, and they make report of it, and
   their testimony is to be believed, why may we not believe as well the
   credible testimony of former times, as believe the credible testimony
   of persons in our own time? If the sober reason of men be yielded to in
   this case, no man can imagine what reason of difference is assignable,
   but that we may as well rely upon the testimony of our forefathers,
   concerning matters of fact, as upon the testimony of those that live in
   the same age with us; but have seen with their own eyes, what we have
   not seen with ours. And do not we know that most of the estates in
   which persons do claim property, do depend upon the testimony of
   witnesses that are dead a hundred years ago? Certainly, men would have
   very bad titles to their estates, if the testimony of witnesses, dead
   many scores of years or some hundreds of years ago, were Hot to be
   relied on even now. This is plain, that we have the same rational way
   and method of knowing these books to be the same they were, that is, by
   such testimony as is the very means of setting on foot all property,
   and all the administration of law and justice, in civilized nations,
   all the world over. And we have the same means to know this, as by
   which we come to know, that any other writings are theirs whose names
   they bear: such as the writings of Seneca, Aristotle and the like. We
   have the same means to know this by, as we have for other things that
   are of greatest importance to mankind in this world, and by which we
   come to know, other men's works that we have now in our hands, are the
   same which were written so many hundred years ago. And if so, then it
   were the most unreasonable thing, that miracles should now be reckoned
   necessary to be wrought to prove this thing to us, and if a miracle
   were now to be wrought, there must be a relying upon present witnesses,
   upon the testimony of this present age; and why might we not as well
   rely upon witnesses of the former age, as on witnesses of the present
   age? No reason can be as signed. Therefore, it would be absurd to
   expect God should extraordinarily prove this to ns, when it could be
   sufficiently proved otherwise. That is the first thing to be forelaid.

   And being forelaid, this one general consideration will prove, that
   these books are the same that they were in Christ's and his apostles'
   time, and cannot be otherwise; that is, that material alterations of
   them were altogether impossible. When I say material alterations, I
   only mean this, that there may have been some very minute undesigned
   alteration in transcribing of co pies; a word may have been mistaken,
   or a letter may have been mistaken, somewhat here or there left out.
   But this can be no material or hurtful alteration, because they had
   always other copies to correct such mistakes by, but there could be no
   material alteration with design, that is the thing I deny to be
   possible, and assert to be impossible. There could be no designed
   alteration either of the books of the Old Testament, or of the books of
   the New Testament, since the time of Christ and his apostles. And,

   [1.] Not of the books of the Old Testament.

   First. It is impossible they can have been altered, since it is plain
   they were preserved before, and for a considerable time afterwards,
   with the greatest care imaginable. And that it is .one of the great
   wonders of providence that God, for the preservation of these books,
   should make use of that scrupulous, and I might say, almost
   superstitious care that was among those Jews, whose office it was to
   keep the books of the Old Testament. As,

   It was known, they used to count all the letters of the Old Testament,
   that they might be sure never to miss a letter. Again,

   In transcribing copies, (which was frequent) every copy was always
   examined by an appointed number of their wise men, as they termed them.
   Further,

   If any copy should have been found, upon examination, to have four or
   five faults in it, in one copy of the whole Old Testament, that book
   was presently adjudged to be buried in the grave of one or other of
   their wise men. And lastly,

   For those books that, upon examination, were found to be punctually
   true, it was very plain from the history of those times, that there was
   the greatest reverence paid to them imaginable. They never used to
   touch those perfect copies (taking them into their hands) without
   kissing them solemnly; nor to lay them down again without solemn
   kissing of them. They were never used to sit upon the place where one
   of those books were wont to be laid. If one of them by casualty fell to
   the ground, they appointed a solemn fast to be kept for it, as an
   ill-boding thing, that such a thing should happen. So that it is most
   plain that these keepers of the books of the Old Testament could never
   have it in design to corrupt any of them; but it was that which they
   did abhor above all things. And it was a principle (as Philo tells us,
   and Josephus much to the same purpose) instilled into the youth of that
   nation, and even those of the best quality, that they should run the
   utmost hazard and incur a thousand deaths, rather than they should
   suffer, to the utmost of their power, any alteration or diminution of
   any of those books: or that any of them should be lost any other way.
   And then, besides all this scrupulous care of the keepers of the books
   of the Old Testament, (with which a design of corrupting would no way
   consist) we may add,

   Secondly, That the thing itself was afterwards impossible, simply
   impossible. If they would before, when it was in their own hands, they
   could; but afterwards, if they would, they could not; because that in
   Christ's, and his apostles' days, a great number of them were (you
   know) converted to the Christian faith, who knew all the books of the
   Old Testament as well as themselves. Therefore, it was impossible now,
   for the infidel Jews, those that were not converted, to make any
   alteration, but it must be presently spied and exclaimed against:
   therefore it was a vain thing for any to attempt it, after so many were
   converted to the Christian religion. And there upon we may further add,

   Thirdly. That the testimonies that were contained in these books
   against themselves, and with which contained in them, they are
   transmitted to us, do shew that they never went about to corrupt them.
   The many testimonies against idolatry, contained in these books,
   whereby their forefathers from age to age, for many ages, were
   witnessed against, would have induced them to expunge all things that
   were therein contained against idolatry, (so tender were they of their
   reputation) if there had not been a great awe upon their minds, never
   to at tempt the corrupting or the alteration of any thing in those
   books. The wickedness of their forefathers was, in these books, so
   highly remonstrated against, in respect of the testimonies they so
   often give against their idolatry, and yet these books we find in their
   own hands, with these testimonies in them, against the Jews and their
   forefathers, for many foregoing ages through sundry times and divers
   intervals; though we do not find after the second temple, that people
   relapsed into that crime. And then, there is the fullest testimony
   against their infidelity in these books that can be. Who would not
   wonder that these books should come out of the hands of the Jews, with
   these testimonies, in the great controversy between the Christians and
   them? that is, of Christ being the Messiah, in which you have so
   punctual assertions against them, that nothing can be more. Those many
   testimonies that do concern the Messiah, particularly that famous
   prophecy, that the sceptre should not depart from Judah till Shilo
   should come: and those numerous presages in many of the latter
   prophets, (Isaiah especially and sundry others,) make it one of the
   greatest wonders of providence, that such a book should come, with
   these things in it, out of these men's hands, against whom they are a
   continual remonstrance. But however, this proves that they did never
   design any alteration: either they saw it impossible for one while, and
   before that, they had no inclination or inducement that would he
   prevailing with them to go about it, that is, that there should be an
   alteration with design. And then,

   [2.] For the books of the New Testament; that they cannot have been
   corrupted is most evident too. It is impossible they can, for you must
   consider in what time they were written: they must be written in
   Christ's time and the apostles'; now within the compass of that time,
   things were brought to that state, that such a corruption was
   impossible upon two accounts, upon account of the distance of places
   into which the gospel was spread, and upon account of the divisions
   that were so early fallen out among christians.

   First. Upon account of the distance of places whereinto, in the first
   century of years, the gospel was spread. That is, into a vast part of
   Asia, and some considerable parts of Africa and Europe; some think into
   Britain itself, into our land. There are not very improbable grounds of
   conjecture, that it was so, even within the compass of Paul's own age.
   That made it impossible there could be any designed corruption or
   alteration in the writings of the New Testament; so considerable a
   number of men at such a distance from one another, could not agree to
   make such an alteration; and if they could not agree in it, one part
   must remonstrate against the other. And,

   Secondly. The divisions that so early appeared in the Christian church
   made it likewise impossible. That passage of the apostle (it may be) is
   not greatly enough pondered according to the weightiness of the
   expression, that there must be heresies, there should be heresies,
   there must be heresies. This great use that hath been of the divisions
   in Christian churches is not (it may be) considered as it should be by
   many. But nothing can carry a clearer evidence and demonstration with
   it, than that, because of those divisions, any depravation of the said
   records, (that is, any material, general, successful, continued
   depravation,) is altogether impossible: because the one party would be
   continually declaiming and crying out against the other: and then how
   soon would it be espied? So for that particular instance, 1 John v. 7
   "There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and
   the Holy Ghost, and these three are one." It is true it hath been found
   to be wanting in some few copies; and what an outcry was against it in
   the Christian church? So that if that alteration was made by the design
   of the arians, (and if it were by any design at all, it must be by
   their design) the very supposal of it brings the greatest blot upon
   them and their cause, that could be imagined; it being very plain that
   it was to be found in equally ancient copies. But it seems more likely,
   it was never left out by design at all. But because the matter at the
   beginning of the 8th verse, was just the same with that of the
   beginning of the 7th verse, a more negligent transcriber, having his
   eye on the beginning of the 8th verse, might write on and slip over
   merely casually the whole 7th verse. This being more likely that a
   verse, beginning as the following verse does, and ending like it,
   should be left out, than that a verse more than ought, should be put
   in. And thus, the design of making such an alteration would be defeated
   upon the attempt; so that upon that consideration it is altogether
   impossible, that there should be any alteration at all. And therefore
   that this be stuck to, that there is no designed alteration in these
   books, and so can have been no material alteration in them.

   It is true that in translations, persons have laboured to serve their
   own purposes, by translating this way and that, as they thought fit.
   But for alteration of copies, that is what never entered into the mind
   of any body to attempt; which is a thing so easily spied out, that
   nothing is more so; and so must needs blast and disserve the cause and
   interest of that party it was designed to serve, and therefore could
   never be. And the impossibility of any such alteration, it is easy for
   any man that useth his understanding, to apprehend from a familiar
   instance. As thus, do but take any one people that are under the same
   government, and that have their laws by which they are governed,
   digested into some system or other; as for instance, our statute book;
   why suppose any ill-minded men in the nation should have a design to
   corrupt and alter the statute book; every one would see it to be
   impossible. Which way should they go to work to impose a false statute
   book upon a nation, where in every man's right and property is
   concerned? And if any such should have such a design, they would soon
   give it up, as finding it impossible, and a thing not to be done, and
   therefore a vain thing to attempt. But the difficulty is a thousand
   times greater, of making any designed alteration of these sacred books
   and records, that are spread so unspeakably further than a nation, and
   wherein the concernments of all that have them in their hands are
   recorded, not temporal only, but eternal. Here is their all for
   eternity, and another world: so that it must be altogether impossible
   that there could have been such a thing effected; and therefore it is
   the most unlikely thing, that such a matter should ever be attempted.
   And then, I say, if there be that plain evidence, that for that reason,
   these books must be the same, that they cannot have been altered with
   design, and consequently not materially, then it were the most
   unreasonable thing in all the world, to expect, that God should confirm
   it to us otherwise than he hath done, or that the nature of the thing
   doth admit of: because otherwise, there must have been miracles wrought
   for every one to see, and take notice of; nay, that would altogether
   lose the usefulness and significancy of miracles themselves, because it
   would make miracles so common in such a case. If every man must have a
   miracle to prove to him, this is God's book, it would take off that
   particular thing for which they are only significant with men, that is,
   because they are rare and extraordinary things: and then they would
   cease to be so. It might as well be expected that every man should have
   a Bible reached him down by an invisible hand from heaven, as that
   there should be a miracle wrought to prove to him, that this was the
   same book that was so and so confirmed and sealed in our Saviour's, and
   his apostles' time. And therefore I reckon, that upon the grounds that
   have been laid, it is very plain, both that these books, that were
   extant, under the name of the Scripture, in our Saviour's and his
   apostles' time, were of divine authority: and that the books that we
   now have in our hands, are the same with those books, and therefore are
   of divine authority.

LEC. IX. [118]

   Now what we shall further say, as to the two things laid down before,
   will be to answer an objection which possibly may arise in the minds of
   some: to wit,

   That this way of being ascertained of the divinity first, and then
   secondly, concerning the identity and sameness still of these books,
   doth seem to resolve our faith, at length, into a human testimony and
   so, at length, to make only a human faith. That is, that all rests upon
   this--that we have been truly told, and by such as lived before us in
   the world, that there were such books in their time, and we are led by
   testimony in following ages, to collect, that these are the same books.
   Is not this (may some say) to resolve our faith into a human testimony,
   and so to make it only a human faith? In answer to this I have several
   things to say.

   I. That it is very plain, that a human testimony must be depended upon
   aliquatenus, some way or other, in reference to all the concernments of
   religion. That is a point out of doubt, some dependance there must be
   upon human testimony. Suppose a preacher came among a company of
   illiterate men, men that could never so much as read; or if any of them
   were so, (which is a thing not unusual in Christian congregations) and
   he takes a text and produces (it may be) many more parallel ones out of
   the Bible for the doctrine which he preacheth; how can these men know
   that this is a Bible he preacheth out of, but by a human testimony? And
   even for those that can read, they must depend upon a human testimony,
   that what they read is a true translation: supposing them not to be
   learned themselves in, or not having opportunity to consult the
   originals, they must depend upon the testimony of the learned, who have
   viewed those books in the originals, such as lexicographers, and the
   like, for the true signification and translation of the words they
   read. This therefore is plain and out of question, that some use there
   must be of a human testimony in reference to the concernments of
   religion. And I add,

   2. It is no more strange that God should state our case, so as to
   oblige us to some dependance upon human testimony, than that he should
   state it so as we must have a necessary dependance upon our own sense.
   We are told that "faith comes by hearing;" we can have no ordinary way
   to come to the knowledge of the things contained in these books, but by
   the use of our eyes, and the use of our ears. And I could fain know why
   there should be a greater sacredness in these organs of our own, than
   in those of other men. Why should mine eye or ear be thought a more
   sacred thing than the voice or tongue of another man? And again,

   3. It is one thing to use a human testimony, in a case where in God
   hath ordained and appointed to do it, and another thing to do it
   besides, or against his ordination and appointment. Here we are to
   distinguish between matters of fact, and matters of right. We are to
   make use of the testimony of men, even by God's own appointment, in
   reference to matters of fact; to inform us only of mere matter of fact.
   This is an institution of God. "It is written in your law (saith our
   Saviour) that the testimony of two or three witnesses is true." "I come
   unto you in the mouth of two or more witnesses," saith the apostle,
   "and in the mouth of two or three witnesses, shall every word be
   established." This is a divine ordination: it is not an arbitrary thing
   taken up by men at random, and of their own choice and pleasure; but it
   is God's stated medium and way, wherein he hath appointed, that persons
   are to be informed concerning matters of fact, which they are concerned
   to know, and of which they have not the immediate knowledge themselves.
   "It is written in your law (saith Christ to the Jews) that the
   testimony of two men is true." What law was that? It was the divine
   law. God hath enacted, that the testimony of a competent number of
   witnesses should be relied upon, to as sure us of the truth of those
   matters of fact, that they do testify, and you do well know, that upon
   this ground (so material a thing this is) depends all the
   administration of justice throughout the world. Otherwise, no judge
   would determine in reference to any case, which came not under the
   sight of his own eye, or whereof he was not an ear-witness. And so this
   would subvert the very foundations of all human society. There could be
   no such thing as human society in the world, upon these terms, and
   therefore we must look upon this as a holy, wise constitution of the
   great Ruler of this world, who hath ordained and appointed, that in
   reference to such matters of fact, as we are concerned to have the
   knowledge of, and have not the immediate knowledge of ourselves, we are
   to depend upon the testimony of others. And this is not an arbitrary
   thing that we take up of ourselves, but a thing that the wisdom of
   heaven -hath constituted and set for the preserving of common order
   here, among men in this world. And

   4. The difference is unspeakably great, between relying upon men's
   testimony, as to mere matters of fact; and relying upon it, as to
   matters of right. We may have a difference upon the authority of one or
   two credible witnesses, reporting to us such matters of fact, when as
   to which is right and wrong, we will have no dependance upon them at
   all. As now suppose any of you receive a letter from some person of
   very great authority and quality, and for whom you have great deference
   and duty, this letter "comes to you by the hands of a foot man; do you
   pay a deference to the man, in believing what is contained in the
   letter? No, all the belief of what is contained in the letter, is
   resolved into the authority of him that wrote it, and from whom it
   comes. Only you may look upon this as a fit medium to convey it to you;
   and you rely (if there be occasion to do so much) no more upon the
   footman, as to matter of fact, but that he received this letter from
   his lord or master to deliver to you; but his testimony hath no
   influence upon the contents of the letter, one way or other.

   And this therefore, leads you sufficiently to understand how to answer
   yourselves, if any should further inquire--Pray how doth this differ
   from the notion that runs among them of the Romish church, that is,
   that we are beholden to their tradition for the Scriptures we have, and
   for our Christianity, and for all that we have any knowledge of in the
   things of God and religion?--Why it differs the most that can be. For,

   ( 1.) The papists do not only claim to be witnesses in the case, but
   they claim to be the only witnesses: which they most pretencelessly and
   injuriously assume to themselves: for we do not rely upon them as the
   sole witnesses, nor as witnesses at all, but only as they join and fall
   in with the concurrent testimony of the rest of the Christian churches,
   that have the same books among them that we have. We are no more
   beholden to them, than we are to other Christians. Nor,-

   (2.) Do we rely barely upon the testimony of Christian churches, as to
   the matters of fact contained in these books, but we rely upon the
   concurrent testimony of the rest of the world, Jews and pagans
   themselves, as to the truth of matters of fact, which we need to be
   informed about, in the matters of our religion. The papists do engross
   to themselves to be the only witnesses, most falsely, and without the
   least colour of pretence. But we reckon the testimony of an enemy, an
   avowed, professed enemy is of the greatest strength in such a case
   imaginable. That is the testimony we have from the Jews, and the
   testimony we have from the pagans, of matters of fact, when the matter
   of fact is against, plainly against them. This we think we have a great
   deal of reason to lay much stress and weight upon. Now it is very plain
   as to mere matters of fact, pagans themselves have owned the truth of
   those matters of fact, upon which the christian doth depend: to wit,
   the wonderful works wrought by our Saviour and his apostles to prove
   the doctrines that they preached, and that are contained in these
   books. Pagans do not deny these matters of fact, we have them in divers
   of their own writings. For as to those miracles wrought by Christ, in
   his own time, to prove the truth of Christianity, (which was done on
   purpose that they might know that Jesus was the Son of God: that men
   might believe this and that by believing it, might have life through
   his name,) Celsus, that great enemy of the Christian religion, never
   goes about to deny the matter of fact: he knew that would be vain. All
   the world knew the truth of the matter of fact; only he takes a great
   deal of pains to shew how it was possible that such things might be
   done by other invisible powers. Just the same conceit that the Jews had
   among themselves, when they tell our Saviour, that he cast out devils
   by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. That is, they did suppose the
   devil to have fallen out with himself, and that all his business was
   industriously to destroy his own kingdom. Indeed, the greatest and most
   momentous matters of fact, by which Christianity was confirmed at
   first, are freely granted by the most considerable pagans. We find in
   their writings, an acknowledgement of those things that filled the
   world with so much wonder, and they labour partly to turn off all by
   referring the great wonders to other causes and agents; and partly by
   pretending, that as strange things have been wrought by their own
   hands: as the setting up of Apollonius Tyanaeus, that great magician;
   whereas, the disparity is so great that nothing is more so, nor can be
   to any, who consider, that those tricks wrought by him, were easily
   detected of fraud and imposture, and were pretended to be wrought to no
   considerable purpose. But the others were frequent and often repeated,
   and in common sight, and without any design of hiding; so as that when
   men that have been concerned have canvassed and searched as much as
   possible, to know whether they were true or no, the light hath shone
   into their faces, and they have been forced to yield and own that a
   great and notable work hath been done, "and we cannot deny it." And
   with great dread and consternation they beheld the world running after
   Christ and his apostles, these works carrying so great a light in them,
   that were wrought for that design. And,

   (3.) There is this difference besides, in what the papists do arrogate
   to themselves about this matter of testifying, from what we admit and
   assert; that is, that they assume to themselves the making of doctrines
   that shall be of equal authority with these books. And one of their
   greatest men among them, is known to have used that blasphemous saying,
   that this book hath no more of authority than Æsop's fables, other than
   what it hath derived from their church. And if it were not for the
   authority it fetcheth from their church it were no more to be regarded
   than Æsop's fables: which is so great an insolence that indeed one
   would wonder, (but that divine patience will magnify itself till the
   time of taking vengeance upon that apostate church come,) that a
   thunderbolt from heaven should not have vindicated such a blasphemy,
   with all things else that are of the same piece among them, and carry
   the same import and signification: for we know they take upon them to
   say and unsay, to do and undo, to maim and mangle this book, and set up
   contrary institutions to it; as is particularly known in that great
   ordinance of the sacrament of the Lord's supper. And then,

   (4.) As to the business of being mere witnesses of matter of fact,
   there they have proved themselves false and unfaithful; that is, in
   foisting in the apocryphal books into the canon of the Scripture,
   against the authority both of the Jewish church and the ancient church,
   as the world may judge at this day that read them.

   So that there is no parity at all in these two cases, the relying by
   God's institution and appointment upon a human testimony, but as a
   medium to convey and transmit to us our knowledge of bare matter of
   fact, and their assuming to themselves to be the only one to be relied
   upon, not only as to matter of fact, but as to the authority by which
   right and wrong, and the truth and falsehood of doctrine are to be
   finally decided and judged of. And thus far then we think, that the way
   of proving the sameness of these books with those that bore the
   character of sacred books, or books of divine authority, is altogether
   unexceptionable, and so strong, as that there can lie nothing against
   it to the common reason and understanding of men, when we have such a
   way of being assured of this matter, as must be convictive to any that
   do allow themselves the liberty and use of their understandings. And it
   would be a very foolish expectation, to think that God should gratify
   the fanciful curiosities of men, by working wonders among them
   continually and repeatedly to no purpose.

   Upon all this I shall superadd some considerations that may give
   strength to all that hath been said before. As,

   1. By common consent of all mankind, some divine revelation or other is
   necessary to the ends of religion, besides mere natural light. We do
   not find or read of any sort of people under heaven that have pretended
   to any thing of religion, but have likewise also pretended to somewhat
   or other of divine revelation, besides what was natural and common to
   men as men, as necessary for the conduct of the affairs of religion, or
   for which such a thing as religion was to be kept on foot in the world.
   Look back amongst any sort of people as to the most ancient accounts we
   have in the world of any thing of religion and we shall find it so: as
   for instance, if we go to the Egyptians of old, the Phoenicians, the
   Assyrians, the Persians, the Grecians, the Romans, the ancient Gauls
   and Britons; nay, if we carry it as far as China: for such accounts as
   we have of their religion and what it hath been for some hundreds of
   years past, nay, and some thousands of years backwards. All these
   people have pretended to somewhat of divine revelation, over and
   besides natural light, none of them but have had those among them whom
   they always took to be inspired persons. I am not considering now,
   whether their pretensions be right or wrong, true or false, but all
   have agreed in this sentiment, that there did need some other
   revelation besides the light of nature, in order to the ends and
   purposes of religion. They always had some sacred persons among them.
   Their priests, their magi, gymnosophists, their brahmins, their bards,
   their druids, whom they always took for inspired persons; and received
   dictates and directions from them still in reference to matters of
   religion: yea, and in reference to other matters too, as so many
   inspired persons: thus still by their own confession, owning mere
   natural light insufficient for the purposes of religion. Famous it is,
   (besides all that hath been intimated before,) concerning those several
   sorts of sacred persons, that the several nations had amongst them,
   that when Numa began to settle religion at Rome, in the first forming
   of that people he pretended to have all his directions from his goddess
   Egeria whom he conversed and met with in the woods, and consulted of
   those affairs from time to time. And the people of the Chinese are
   reckoned to have all their methods of religion and all their notions of
   it from that Confucius for whom they have the greatest veneration, that
   ever any people could be supposed to have of one as an inspired person,
   so as that deference was never paid by the Turks to their Mahomet,
   which is paid by these Chinese, to their Confucius whom they had their
   religion from, at least one thousand years before ever the other was
   known in the world.

   Now this, to me, is a very great thing, that by the common consent of
   mankind in all the known and noted nations of which we have any record
   or notices among us; they should pretend constantly to somewhat or
   other of divine revelation, in reference to the affairs of religion;
   thereby giving us, as the common sentiment of mankind, that mere
   natural light was not enough, but some divine revelation was further to
   be superadded, for the conduct and management of the affairs of
   religion in the world. And to that is to be added,

   2. That as this would be argumentum ad hominem, (it being the common
   sentiment of mankind,) so it is very apparent from the nature of the
   thing, that really and truly it is a matter of plain necessity in
   itself, that there be some superadded revelation to the mere light of
   nature. For notwithstanding the pretence of it, (that pretence of it to
   be sure, can never do the business or answer the end for which the
   thing itself is necessary) yet it is plain, that the very thing, that
   is, a real and divine revelation is necessary over and besides mere
   natural light, as that lies now so much corrupted, depraved and
   obscured, among the sons of men, if you do but consider into how
   miserable delusions, men have generally fallen, where such a real
   divine revelation was wanting, in reference to the greatest and most
   important things of religion. As what can we suppose greater or of more
   importance to religion than these two, the object of it, and the end of
   it? The Object of it is the God we are to worship, and the end of it is
   the felicity that we are to design and aim at in all the exercises of
   that worship, and in the whole course of our religion. Where there is
   not a real divine revelation, what monstrous conceits have been taken
   up concerning the object of religion! The polytheism of the gentile and
   pagan world, is a plain and pregnant proof what a necessity there was,
   that over and besides the mere light of nature, God should reveal
   himself as the peculiar and sole Object of religion, according to what
   he is in himself. For though it be true indeed, that many of the wisest
   philosophers among the pagans, have had right sentiments of the one
   Deity, the supreme Numen, God; yet for the generality of the people how
   much otherwise hath it been? And with whom those wiser men have been
   forced to comply and fall in, temporising with them whose own wicked
   and gross conceptions have led them to worship for deities, the sun,
   moon and stars; or heroes, the souls of men departed from among them,
   and sometimes to come so low as to worship dogs and cats, weasels,
   apes, serpents, onions, leeks and garlic, fountains and rivers and the
   like, for gods. So apparent need was there for a divine revelation to
   inform men about the object of their worship, above that light that is
   common to men as men. And then as concerning the end of religion,
   felicity, the great diversity of opinions among the pagans, (and even
   the wiser of them) no less than two hundred, eighty and eight, about
   the summum bonum, chief good, shews how great need there is of a
   particular divine direction, as to what that is which we are to design
   for ourselves as our final and eternal felicity. To these I add,

   3. That supposing the necessity of a divine revelation about matters
   that relate to religion and our future blessedness, it must some time
   or other have become necessary that it should be a written revelation,
   put into writing upon record. Some time I say, I do not say always
   necessary. It is plain it must be less necessary in former ages of the
   world, when by reason of the vast longevity and length of life, about
   three or four persons might see through two thousand years and upwards,
   and so give an account but by three or four hands, of the most material
   and important things, that were of common concernment for men, as such,
   to know about the beginning of the world and the like. And no doubt
   there was great care taken to preserve the memory of what was necessary
   to be known, by monuments and the like, as Seth's pillars were, of
   which Josephus gives a particular account in his time. But I suppose
   there were only oral traditions, for that time, passing from hand to
   hand; and that of things of so apparent, common importance and
   necessity, that none can imagine but if the person? were persons of
   tolerable prudence, (and we have no reason but to apprehend they were
   persons of great prudence, some at least that were more especially
   concerned, as Adam himself, Enoch, Noah and Shem,) there could not but
   have been very distinct accounts transmitted from such hands, of what
   was necessary to be known concerning the original of the world, and
   what the pleasure of him that made it was, concerning the affairs of
   his worship in those days. And we may easily apprehend ourselves if, in
   any family among us, any thing of great concernment to the nation,
   (mush more to all mankind,) should have come to the notice of an
   ancestor of ours; as, suppose any of you could say, "My grandfather or
   my great grandfather had certain notices, some way or other, conveyed
   to him of such and such matters of fact, of the greatest importance
   imaginable to the whole nation," Do you think that that would be
   forgotten in three or four ages in that family? And as little
   supposable is it, that in three or four ages of so long a duration, all
   that concerned the original of the world, and revealed will of its
   Creator, how men ought to live, and order their course in the world y
   would be forgotten.

   But afterwards, when the lives of men grew shorter, it is most
   apparent, there was a necessity that such things as were most requisite
   to be known, and were of most common use, should be digested into
   records in writing. And so we find first, the books of Moses written;
   and afterwards, there was an addition of more and more made, as God
   thought fit, in following ages, till the fulness of time, when we have
   the clearest light of an entire gospel revelation handed to us from our
   Lord himself, who came from the bosom of his* Father to reveal and make
   him known, and his whole mind and will to men. And indeed, for them
   that would substitute tradition, and particularly that of oral
   tradition in the room of this sacred written rule, they do it with the
   greatest absurdity that can be imagined: and indeed with the greatest
   immodesty, in them that now a-days pretend to it. It is true, we read
   the apostle did take order with Timothy that some particular things
   which he had seen and taken notice of, and heard from him, he should
   commit to faithful men that might besuitablee to teach and instruct
   others. There were many useful things that were not presently put into
   writing. But as for these men, under the notion of faithful witnesses,
   they have the least reason of any men in the world to lay claim to that
   office and dignity, of being the conveyancers to us of the things that
   concern us, in reference to our salvation and our eternal well-being:
   for when they take upon them to be authors, they cannot be looked upon
   to have done the part of faithful witnesses. How strangely have they
   innovated upon that religion which they boast to have been the
   conveyers of to us! How much another thing have they made it, to what
   it was, in doctrinals and worship, and even in reference to the affairs
   of common conversation itself? So that we may see, even by the
   insolency of this pretence of theirs, enough to assure us of the
   necessity of such a written rule to resort unto. And indeed, in what
   case had the Christian religion been at this day and the professors of
   it in the world, if we had not had this written rule in our hands, to
   correct and discover plainly wherein they have prevaricated and
   corrupted the Christian religion? So that we may seek Christianity in
   the Christian world, as was said of old concerning the City of Samium,
   it was so altered that Samium was to be sought in Samium itself; so we
   would still be to seek Christianity among christians, if we had not
   these records to set us right, and let us know what Christian religion
   was at first.

   And upon the whole matter, as to those that would so officiously
   substitute their traditions in the room of the clear light of this
   written word, it is much a like case as if any of you should fall in
   with one travelling on the way, and he offers himself to be your
   companion and guide, and tells you that you have eyes that you make use
   of in choosing your way, but these eyes are only troublesome to you,
   they represent to you diversities of objects that draw this way and
   that, so that you cannot mind your path. "And pray (saith he) let me
   put out those eyes of yours and submit yourself to my conduct;" and all
   that he may guide you into a pit. Or a like case it would be, as if you
   should have writings in your hands, any of you, that were ancient, and
   did concern the title to an estate of yours from ages past, and one
   should say to you "These writings have a great deal of obscurity in
   them, pray let me have these writings and dispose of them as I see
   good, and you need not doubt but that there will be witnesses enough to
   prove your title if there be occasion; and you do not need to question
   but I will take care to defend you and make out your title;" and to
   think to rob you of them by such a fraudulent artifice. Just thus would
   they deal with us about the sacred records, in which our all for
   eternal life do lie. But very plain it is upon all these grounds, that
   it was necessary there should be some what of divine revelation
   superadded to mere natural light; and was also necessary, some time,
   that it should be a written one.

   4. Supposing this, that it is necessary there should be a written
   revelation of the mind of God, about matters that do concern our
   present religion and future felicity, then we have none at all extant
   in the world that can come in any plausible competition with this book,
   unless you will bring the Mahometan Alcoran into competition with it.
   Nothing else doth pretend to be a rule of faith and light to men. And
   for that Alcoran, (besides what it hath borrowed, or stolen, rather
   from the Bible) it is a book full of so gross absurdities, that they
   who have but common sense, would soon discern the difference between
   them; and how little of pretence there could be to bring that in to
   competition with this, much less to carry it against this upon such a
   comparison. There are things in it so manifestly contrary to the common
   light and reason of men, as there would be ground enough for a most
   contemptuous rejection of it upon that score:--such as its asserting
   the corporeity of the divine nature; and that the felicity of the
   future state in the other world doth consist only in bodily pleasures
   and the like; things manifestly refutable by common natural light. And
   besides the contradiction that there is to the common reason of men in
   so great things as these, it is made up of contradictions and
   repugnancies to itself. For it doth say even that concerning him, upon
   whom, you know our great hopes depend, which it doth, in the most
   substantial things, afterwards gainsay and contradict, for it owns him
   to be a great and a holy prophet, sent by God into this world. But if
   their religion should be true, he must be the falsest prophet (one of
   them) that ever was upon the face of the earth, or that ever pretended
   to prophesy; for did not he avow and give himself out to be the Son of
   God? If he were a true prophet he did truly say this, that he was the
   Son of God, and that he and his Father were one: and if he were a true
   prophet he did truly say this also, that the religion he taught and the
   professors of it, should continue, and he with them, to the end of the
   world; and then the Mahometan religion was never to subvert and root
   out the Christian.

   It is plain therefore, that nothing under the name of a divine
   revelation can with any, the least plausibleness be brought into
   competition with this book. And therefore, if a divine revelation were
   necessary, and a written revelation were necessary, this must be it and
   there can be no other. It is true indeed, some enthusiastical persons
   have pretended to inspiration as to this or that particular thing: but
   none have undertaken to pretend, that they are so inspired of God as to
   give a full, particular, perfect system and model, of all that is to be
   believed and done, in reference to worship and religion. So that this
   book hath really no plausible pretender or competitor against it.

   5. Whereas, it doth pretend and avow itself to be divine, and of divine
   original; it hath those inimitable characters of divinity upon it,
   which most plainly justify that pretence: I shall, before I instance,
   only forelay this That we must consider, when we would make a judgment
   upon this thing, whether this thing be a godlike thing, yea or no, and
   carries visible characters of divinity stamped upon it, we are, in
   making our judgment about this matter, to consider, not barely what is
   spoken or contained in this book, but also to whom such things are
   spoken, whose use this book was designed to serve, and what use it was
   intended for. We are not to consider, in this case, how God should
   speak if he were to publish an edict, or make an oration from the
   throne of glory to the innumerable company of angels, those glorious
   creatures that surround him above. That is none of the case that we are
   to consider. But we are to consider how we would expect him to speak,
   or how he would direct things to be written, that were intended for all
   sorts of men, here in this world, from the highest to the lowest, of
   all capacities and of all conditions, that have any exercise of reason
   and understanding. We are not to expect that one sort of Bible should
   have been written for learned men, and another for unlearned; or that
   one sort of Bible was written for citizens and another for country
   people; but we are to suppose that there was to be a book written that
   should suit the capacities of all sorts of persons from the highest to
   the lowest. And what could have been more Godlike, more suitable to his
   wisdom and goodness, and more agreeable to the capacity and necessity
   of men in general, than what we have here in this book? And consider
   the use that it was to serve, what it was indeed to be written for. It
   was for the saving of miserable creatures that were in a lost perishing
   state. It was never intended that such a book should be written, only
   to please men's fancies or gratify their humours, or tickle their ears.
   It was intended for saving lost miserable souls, from perishing for
   ever; and those of all sorts, of all capacities, from the highest to
   the lowest: and so nothing could have been imagined more worthy of God,
   than the composure of this Book, for such persons and for such uses.
   And now to particularize a little, as to such divine characters which
   are conspicuous in it, and which I call inimitable, that could have
   proceeded from none but a divine Author.--As,

   (1.) The majesty of the style: How great, how august and Godlike it is!
   in the whole of it: take it entirely in the whole frame, and nothing
   could appear, in respect to the style, more majestic or more worthy of
   God. Though the case must beconsidered with a diversity, that is, that
   he did make use of human penmen, and it is never to be supposed, that
   he should direct every word and every phrase, by an extraordinary
   immediate inspiration: for then it were impossible there should have
   been a diversity of style, but all the parts must have been in one and
   the same style. But there was that influx of the divine Spirit that did
   most certainly guide the writers, as to all the substance, of what was
   to be written and recorded by them; which did attemper itself to the
   natural genius of those that were made use of as the penmen, so that
   the communication of the Holy Ghost, received by such and such men, of
   such and such a constitution, temper and genius, comes to be
   diversified in that manner, as if one come to pour a quantity of water
   in to such and such a particular vessel, the water in its form will
   resemble the figure of the vessel: if the vessel be round, the water
   falls into a round figure; if the vessel be square, the water is formed
   into that figure unavoidably. And so the same communication of the Holy
   Ghost, being poured into such a vessel as this or that man was, comes
   to be accordingly diversified. That very communication to such a one as
   Isaiah, for instance, receives one sort of figure there, and a
   communication to such a one as Micah, receives another figure there;
   when yet all these communications are from one and the same Fountain,
   and serve for one and the same common purpose. And indeed upon the
   whole, it doth appear, that the greatness of the way of speaking it,
   doth so suit the majesty of God as nothing could do more, when men have
   come forth and spoken and written in the name of the Lord; and have
   from time to time pronounced, "Thus saith the Lord;" and when they have
   been directed to personate God, "I am the Lord; do so and so, I am the
   Lord," this is so becoming the greatness, the grandeur of the Author of
   this book, that it is not a supposable thing that there should be any,
   that would assume the confidence, in reference to things of this
   nature, to take upon them at such a rate; that is, comparing the
   confidence of such a pretence with the matter that is spoken of; and
   nothing is more evident than that this is agreeable to God only, or to
   one immediately directed by God only, and none else. And upon what was
   noted to you concerning the difference of styles, for such parts of
   this book wherein God is represented to be the immediate Speaker,
   himself making this use of man, it is evident in such cases, when he
   hath appeared more immediately as the Author of what was said, nothing
   beneath God can be supposed to have spoken like him. As now to
   instance, there is that song called the song of Moses in the 32. of
   Deuteronomy; God doth give immediate directions to publish the words of
   such a song to this people, and to keep it as a record among them. It
   seems most likely that every word there, was dictated immediately by
   God himself. And who did ever read any thing so great and so august as
   the words of that song are? And so when we find God immediately
   speaking to Job, in some of the latter chapters of that book, Who can
   imitate the majesty of what is said? which is there spoken unto him,
   when God speaketh to him himself out of the whirlwind. And,

   (2.) Consider the sublimity of the matter: How mighty, great things are
   contained in this book! As in that Hosea viii. 12. "I have written unto
   them the great things of my law." To take such a summary as that, 1
   Tim. iii. 16. "Without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness:
   God was manifest in. the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of
   angels, preached unto the gentiles, believed on in the world, received
   up into glory." How mighty things are these, of how sublime a nature!
   And these make the principal contents of this book. And then,

   (3.) Do but consider again, the comprehensiveness of this Sacred
   Volume, of how vast extent it is. And what mind, but the mind of God
   could have comprehended and collected together so great a variety of
   things as we find in this book? So as that nothing can be pretended to
   be wanting; not one thing can be so much as alleged is wanting that is
   requisite to be put into such a book, to serve the end it pretends to
   serve, and that it avows itself to be designed for. Things that suit
   all states of men from the highest to the lowest, all ages and each
   sex. Things we have that make up the system of what we are to believe,
   and things that compose and make up the system of what we are to do,
   and what makes up the system for us of what we are to desire. Do but
   look to the credenda, and the agenda and the petenda or speranda: where
   we may have the collected digesta of the one kind and the other, and
   who can pretend any thing to be wanting here? The comprehensiveness of
   this book speaks the divinity of it, having that in it which suits
   every case and every purpose for which such a book can be desirable, or
   can be pretended to be so. And then,

   (4.) Consider too, its correspondency to the spirit of man, which it
   was designed to rectify and set right, and be a mea sure unto, if you
   look upon the spirit of man under a threefold capacity. That is, look
   upon it as merely rational, or look upon it as corrupt and depraved, or
   look upon it as regenerate and renewed; and the contents of this book
   do most admirably suitit every way, Look upon it as merely rational,
   and nothing so adequate to the mind and reason of a man; so as that,
   though things in it there are indeed, that the reason of man could not
   have found out; there is nothing in it which the reason of man would
   not approve, being represented and laid before it. If we consider the
   condition of man as corrupt, what delineations have we of the corrupt
   frame and temper of the spirit of man in this state? And nothing, to
   me, is a greater argument of the truth of our religion in general, than
   to find such exact descriptions of the state of man, suiting the temper
   in which he is now to be found upon the original depravation in all his
   conditions in this world. So that just such a thing as a carnal man
   was, and was represented to have been five thousand years ago, just
   such a one he is now; all the imaginations of the thoughts of the heart
   of man are evil, and continually so. And when God looks down from
   heaven upon man, to understand who it is that seeks after God, there is
   none that is found doing good, no not one; none seeking after God; for
   that good must be chiefly meant: as if all the world did agree in that
   one common sense, to say unto God "Depart from us, we desire not the
   knowledge of thy ways: let not God molest or disturb us in our course."
   Just so is the degenerate spirit and temper of man represented, and how
   true a representation is it! And then look upon the spirit of man as
   renewed, and how lively a description is there of the regenerate man,
   the renewed man! just so desiring after God, the living God, as this
   book doth express; there placing its sole felicity and highest delight,
   there reposing its treasure, there placing the study of the heart, to
   be sincere and upright in his sight: who but God could have made such a
   representation of man? And that I take to be a further consideration
   which shews the divinity of this book, even those most inimitable
   characters of its divine Author that are most conspicuous to every
   discerning eye. But I add,

   (5.) The wonderful efficacy this word hath had upon the souls of men,
   from age to age. It hath shewn itself to be "the power of God, through
   faith unto salvation." What multitudes has it subdued! This sword of
   the Spirit, and arrows taken from hence, how "sharp have they been in
   the hearts of the King's enemies," by which multitudes have been thrown
   down and made subject! what conquests hath it made! Though indeed there
   have been sad dark intervals: but no more but what have been foretold
   long ago, wherein the progress of the Christian interest and religion
   should be slow and little: no other was to be expected, according to
   what was long ago foretold of. But if you consider the vast increases
   that were within the first and second centuries, so that some of the
   ancients have taken notice, and one particularly, by way of apology, to
   the emperor that then was, "we grow so numerous" (saith he) "that were
   it not for the peaceableness of our spirits and principles, you could
   not subsist in opposition to us. It were easy for us to overturn the
   empire: and were it possible for us to retire and draw from the world,
   the world would wonder at its own emptiness." And Pliny writing to
   Trojan, another of their emperors, tells him, that rigorous and severe
   practices against the Christians were now altogether impracticable and
   might be dangerous: for he tells him, every where the way to the
   temples was overgrown with grass, and there were none to buy up their
   sacrifices, and there was no way in the world to keep peace in the
   empire, but to be very benign to the Christians. And he did procure by
   that epistle, a great suspension of the rage, and cessation of the
   persecution that was at that time. And then, all this was done, not by
   the power of arms, (as the mahometan religion hath spread itself in the
   world,) but only by the power of this very word, the doctrine of
   Christ; whereby it appears to be "the wisdom of God and the power of
   God." I have discoursed to you at large before, of the strong and
   irrefragable evidence that is given to the truth of this book by the
   prophecies, and by the miracles we find recorded in it; the punctual
   predictions of the former, and the obsignations given to divine truth,
   given by divine power in the latter. But this seal, set upon the souls
   of men by the sanctifying Spirit, (whereof this word hath been
   continually the instrument) carries to seeing and discerning persons,
   the greatest evidence imaginable in it. It was the saying of Plato,
   that "the world is God's epistle to men; the characters of his
   invisible power and goodness being so visible upon it." And how raised
   would his thoughts have been, and how much transported would he have
   been beyond the transport in which he was on this occasion, if he had
   but known and viewed this divine and sacred book! But then, to find it
   again, copied out and transcribed in men's hearts! "You are," saith the
   apostle, "the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink,
   but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in
   the fleshly tables of the heart. 2 Cor. iii. 3. What a demonstration is
   here of the divine Author that hath made work, even by his word, upon
   the hearts and souls of men? So as that the same apostle speaks in
   that, 2 Cor. xiii. 3. "Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me,
   which to you-ward is not weak, but mighty in you?" "Examine yourselves
   whether ye be in the faith," "Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking by
   me?" See him in this book, and look into yourselves, such of you as
   have been converted and turned by my ministry; see if you be not
   Christ's epistle? See if he hath not written out the greatest and most
   necessary things about him and his religion, out of this book into your
   own hearts. And I add,

   (6.) That the high complacency that the best men take in this book,
   must needs prove it to be divine to their own sense. It is true, that
   there wants not rational evidence to demonstrate the divine authority
   or divinity of this book, to any that shall at leisure impartially
   consider the thing. But it is a far more lively proof that any one hath
   of this in himself and in his own soul, when he is made to taste, in
   the word, how gracious the Lord is, when he hath the pleasant relish of
   it in his own spirit: when he can say by his own experience, "Oh, how
   sweet are thy words to my mouth, yea sweeter than honey to my taste!"
   when it is to him a recreation to retire and set himself to think and
   consider and study upon these great and deep things of God; when once
   he comes to experience this, that the law of God is his delight, and
   that therein he can exercise himself night and day. So it was, when
   much less was writ ten of this book than what we now have. If David had
   seen all the writings of the New Testament, and of the prophets that
   succeeded himself, and had had the complete, entire volume in his hands
   that we have, with what transports would he have spoken of the
   ravishing pleasures of this book! how delectable a study must it have
   been to his soul! I hope (though it is much to be lamented indeed that
   there are no more) there are many at this day that find it thus: "We
   approve it ourselves, in our own hearts; this must be, this cannot but
   be the divine word, it is so delectable, so refreshing to our souls."
   And,

   (7.) Lastly. Take this by way of addition, the plain and manifest
   design it hath to make men holy and good; and consequently to make them
   blessed and happy at length, proves it to be divine. It hath manifestly
   this design; and can have no other. This is a thing that speaks itself
   to every conscience of man that doth consider, that is, that this book
   in the general composure of it hath a design to make men good and holy;
   and consequently to make them blessed and happy; and can have no other
   design. Every one must suppose that such a book as this, came not by
   chance into the world; if not by chance, then it came by design; and if
   it came by design, then something or other must lie designed in it. It
   doth serve this end manifestly, aims at this, to make men holy and
   pure, and fit them for heaven and a blessed eternity; and it hath no
   other design, it aims at nothing else. This then must be of God; this
   must either have been a divine revelation from God himself, (as it
   avows itself to be,) or it must be one of the most horrid forgeries
   that ever was contrived under heaven, ever since the creation of the
   world. But I would appeal to any man's conscience, whether it is likely
   any one would be guilty of so audacious a wickedness, to entitle the
   holy God to be the Author of an imposture, for no other end than to
   make men holy and good? would men be so wicked as this, for no other
   end but to make the world good? Their own fact would fly in their
   faces. Here is a design to make the world holy and happy; and if the
   world were thus, as this book would make it, if it were suitable to it
   and the contents of it, if there were that love to God and Christ and
   our neighbours, that holiness, that righteousness upon earth that are
   expressed in, and designed to be promoted by this book, what a blessed
   world were this! The very image and idea of heaven itself. But to think
   that men should be guilty of the greatest wickedness that ever was done
   under the sun, with so good a design, is the most inconsistent and
   unimaginable thing that can be.

   These considerations, superadded to what was largely spoken to before,
   I reckon will prove the matter out of doubt, (with all that impartially
   consider and weigh things,) that these Scriptures are of divine
   authority.

LEC. X. [119]

   That which we have further yet to do upon this subject, is only to say
   somewhat by way of answer to an objection or two; and then to conclude
   and shut up all in some use.

   Objection 1. Some such thought may possibly arise in the minds of some,
   that if these books be indeed of divine revelation in order to the
   salvation of souls, as you have heard they are, it may seem strange
   that they have been confined to so little a part of the world, to so
   small a portion of mankind. As for the books of the Old Testament,
   while they only were in being, that they should be shut up in so narrow
   limits as Pales tine, a very little, inconsiderable spot, compared with
   the rest of the world. In Judah, it was said God was known, as being
   unknown to the rest of the world. Psalm lxxvi. 1. And he gave his word
   to Jacob, and his statutes and judgments, to Israel; and did not so to
   any nation. Psalm cxlvii. 19, 20. To the Jews were committed the
   oracles of God, as the apostle speaks. Rom. iii. 2. And afterwards,
   when Christianity came, in the fulness of time, to obtain in the world,
   how little a way, in comparison, did the Christian records reach, or
   have reached hitherto? According to common computation, the world being
   divided into thirty parts, nineteen do yet remain totally paganish in
   the grossest sense, and the other eleven, between mahometans and
   christians, and not above a sixth part of the world that are so much as
   christians in name, and of them how great a part have the Bible
   reserved and locked up from them, they not being permitted the use and
   knowledge of it? All this may seem very strange, if we consider these
   Scriptures as a divine revelation purposely vouchsafed in order to the
   salvation of the souls of men.

   Why in reference to this I shall offer you some considerations that I
   hope may not be unuseful. As,

   1. Suppose that there had been no saving design at all, set on foot in
   reference to the apostate sons of men, but that they had been left
   under the same remediless condition with the apostate angels, what
   wrong had there been clone? who could have had whereof to accuse the
   righteous Lord and sovereign Ruler of all this world? Why might not he
   have left all to sink without remedy or hope, into so deserved, yea,
   and a self procured ruin? It is therefore apparently, not a matter of
   right, but of free favour, if God afford any apt and suitable means in
   order to the saving of any. And what is not matter of right may surely
   be withheld without wrong. But,

   2. When upon the fall of Adam it pleased God so graciously to reveal to
   him his saving design and the means of it by that eminent seed of the
   woman, whereof (though those words do carry but an obscure intimation,
   yet) undoubtedly, he did not leave Adam ignorant of the meaning and
   intendment of them. And it is as little to be doubted, but that Adam
   did transmit the knowledge of what he knew himself, in so important a
   matter, to his more immediate posterity. If then they had not been
   wanting to themselves and their posterity, it must necessarily have
   been, that there would have been some sufficient knowledge of a Saviour
   diffused all the world over, wheresoever his posterity had spread
   itself. But if men have herein been wanting to themselves, is the holy
   merciful God to be charged with this? If some very bountiful person
   should confer some great estate, and settle it upon some particular
   family, and they embezzle and lose it, is this to be charged upon the
   bountiful benefactor? And again,

   3. Men did not only by their voluntary neglect, lose the notices that
   were first thus given to Adam, concerning a Saviour, but they lost the
   very notions of God himself. So that by their own negligence and
   malignity, they gradually and universally sunk, even into the grossest
   idolatry, and so by this means, not only lost the opportunity that they
   had of knowing somewhat how man might have been saved out of his lost
   and lapsed estate, but they provoked divine displeasure against them in
   the highest degree. And so their negligence herein, is not only the
   natural means of their being without such knowledge as they otherwise
   would have had, but the provoking cause of God's deserting the world in
   so great a measure, and so generally as he hath deserted it. And thus
   doth the apostle plainly state the case, that because they have not
   been true to that light that was natural and common to them, did not
   follow the conduct, even of the notices of God that they had, therefore
   they have been abandoned and given up: "The wrath of God hath been
   revealed from heaven against the ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
   who hold the truth in unrighteousness." What truth was that? or what
   men were these? It was natural truth, the natural knowledge of God,
   that men had as men; and this was the pagan world that was here chiefly
   spoken of. And for that very reason, because that which was to be known
   of God in them was so manifest to them, even the invisible things of
   God from the creation of the world, his eternal power and Godhead,
   sufficiently to leave them without excuse: yet (as it after follows)
   they liking not to retain God in their knowledge, therefore he gave
   them up; as we see Rom. i. 18, 28. Here is nothing but Nemesis, just
   punishment, and so no cause at all to complain of any injury done to
   men. But,

   4. When yet it pleased God, in order to the revival of the lost state
   of religion in the world, to form a peculiar people to himself, and
   there to set up an eminent light, (as it were,) upon a candlestick, to
   vouchsafe an express revelation of himself to that people, and to
   commit to them his oracles, they were so committed to them, not to be
   confined and hid, but preserved and kept: and that thence, light might
   be transmitted all round about, which accordingly must of course (if
   men had not been wanting to themselves) have spread further and
   further. It was not from any divine appointment; but from the ill
   spirit that ruled amongst that ill people, and from the prejudice and
   negligence of their neighbours, that the light they had, did not spread
   and extend further and further and still further and further, to
   circulate from nation to nation. It proceeded (I say) from the ill
   spirit that was among the Jews who did envy to the rest of the world
   the knowledge of God, which now, for the present, was peculiar to them:
   and to the negligence and prejudice of the rest, that they looked after
   no suck things. Of that ill spirit that ruled among the Jews, that is a
   sad instance, (which I have upon some other occasion told you of) that
   when there was one translation of the Old Testament by the seventy
   elders, enjoined to be made by Ptolemy and they could not tell how to
   hinder it, they appointed a solemn fast universally wherever they had
   any thing at all to do, to lament that the knowledge of God should be
   so diffused amongst others; and go beyond their own bounds. Wherein, as
   they were guilty, no doubt, so the rest of the world were accessary
   too, by their negligence and disaffection to the true knowledge of God,
   to their own continuing ignorance. And further,

   5. That when the Christian records, the books of the New Testament came
   to be added to those of the Old, how should it come to pass but only
   through the general ill temper of men, that Christian knowledge might
   not be as far extended as commerce was between nation and nation,
   kingdom and kingdom &gt; Why might not that commodity have been carried
   as far as gold and silver and precious stones? the price whereof is far
   above all these, "more precious than rubies," or thousands of gold and
   silver. And (as I told you formerly) it was never to be expected, God
   should do that by extraordinary means, that might have been done by
   ordinary. And this being the case, it is little to be expected that God
   (when men might so easily have transmitted such notices from nation to
   nation, and those that were of a greater distance, and might have
   heard, more obscurely, of such and such things might have inquired and
   sent and laboured to inform themselves) should give remedy to such an
   evil as this, by an extraordinary course; that when in an ordinary way
   such knowledge might have been conveyed from country to country, he
   should have sent an angel from kingdom to kingdom, and from nation to
   nation to carry them Bibles. It might have been as well expected that,
   in Christian countries, where the Bible is come, but a great many
   persons being illiterate, and can make no use of it, an angel should be
   sent from house to house to teach their children to read. Again,

   6. Where there hath been both a loss of that Christian knowledge that
   once did obtain, and those very records do (it may be) cease from some
   parts of the world where they have been, this is still to be imputed to
   the same cause, the carelessness and negligence of men about their own
   concernments, even about their greatest concernments, as we are told.
   It is true, that of latter days, in some parts of the world, where
   there have been thirty christians for one pagan, there are now nearly
   thirty mahometans for one christian. Whence is this, but from the
   wilful degeneracy and revolt of those, amongst whom the Christian name
   was sometime professed? It would not have been imposed upon any,
   whether they would or no, to forego their religion, and to let these
   sacred records cease from among them, and substitute a foetid, fulsome,
   ridiculous Alcoran in the room of them. We are not to charge upon God
   these gross negligences and wickednesses of men. And again,

   7. Where these holy books are shut up from people, (as they are
   generally in the romish church,) to what is that to be imputed, but to
   their own carelessness and indifferency and coldness in the concerns of
   their own souls and of the future state? This is a punishment, a just
   punishment upon stupid besotted princes and people, that they would be
   so imposed upon; so absurdly and without pretence; that their priests
   must lock up all from them, that so they might have the leading of
   them, the blind leading the blind into the ditch. We are to consider a
   penal hand in this, as is expressed, 2 Thes. ii. 11. that where the
   truth is not received in the love of it, there God, in judgment, should
   "send strong delusions that they should believe a lie that they all
   might be damned." This is righteous and holy displeasure, and the act
   and effort of punitive justice for very gross and most provoking
   wickedness, that a greater value hath not been had and expressed of
   things so sacred, so precious and of such, concernment to men's souls;
   that the greater part of the Christian world should suffer itself to be
   so grossly imposed upon, and cheated out of the very things wherein
   their very salvation is concerned. Their wickedness in this, did punish
   itself. And God hath most righteously permitted it to be so. And then,

   8. That according to human measures, and even amongst ourselves, the
   government is not concerned when laws are made, to provide that every
   particular person should have the particular knowledge of them. Such
   laws as are of common concernment men are obliged, under penalties, to
   observe: they are to look after them themselves. The government is not
   to take care that every particular person, or family, or parish, or
   town, or country hath this or that particular act of parliament sent to
   them, or a statute book lodged in every such place. That is not their
   care, but it is expected, people should so far concern themselves and
   mind their interests as to acquaint themselves with things, upon which
   the safety of their lives as well as the common peace doth depend. And
   yet further,

   9. Where ignorance of those great things that are contained in the Holy
   Scriptures is altogether invincible; and where it was impossible, in a
   natural way, that such knowledge should come, undoubtedly God will deal
   with men accordingly. He will only proceed with them according to that
   light they had; lie will never punish them for not having that light
   which they never had, nor could have. "As many as sin without the law
   shall perish without the law: and as many as have sinned with the law
   shall perish by the law:" as Romans ii. 12. And,

   10. In the last place, if any such were any where to be found, that did
   to their utmost improve the light and means of knowledge which they
   had, (supposing them never to have had what we have from these holy
   writings,) we do not know what God would have done for their further
   help in that case. But I doubt instances will not be found of such as
   have improved the light they had to the uttermost. How far are we from
   improving as we should and might, that greater light which we have? But
   God hath his ways open to him. We do not know how he did convey light
   of old to those that had it before the Scriptures were written: how Job
   came by his knowledge, and how his friends came by theirs, we do not
   know. But this is undoubtedly the ordinary, stated means of knowledge
   where it is vouchsafed; where God doth afford it. If God doth not
   afford it, he proceeds then by other measures of his own which we know
   nothing of. But certainly he will always walk punctually according to
   that rule, that "whosoever hath, to them shall be given, and they shall
   have more abundantly;" that is, whosoever hath so as to improve what he
   hath, that useth and enjoys what he hath, and God is pleased to trust
   him with, God will never be wanting to such. He will always be
   beforehand with them, as he is never behindhand with any, according to
   that known and generally approved saying of that ancient: Homini
   facienti quod in se est, Deus non deest: God is never wanting to them
   that do improve what they possess. Though he owes them nothing, and
   whatsoever he doth for them is of grace, he is never wanting to those
   that with serious diligence trade with, and improve their present
   talents. And I think more needs not to be said to that objection.

   Objection 2. And it is of less concernment, what might be further
   objected in the second place. That is, it may seem somewhat more
   desirable (at least) that these Scriptures had contained things that
   are of necessity to salvation in a more distinct method, that we might
   have had (as it were) all the several heads belonging to religion,
   reduced as in a common place book, to such and such distinct topics,
   that every one might know whither to go presently for all things that
   do be long to such and such a head. But,

   1. I answer; It is enough to those that consider things modestly, and
   with that subjection and resignation of spirit that we ought to have,
   to take notice only that God hath thought another course fitter. And
   that is surely best which he thinks best. So submissive and resigned
   ought our minds and understandings to be to the divine mind. But,

   2. Supposing the most accurate method that could be imagined were used
   in all things, as was suggested, yet however, there would have been a
   continual use and need of a stated office, to be continued through all
   the successions of time, purposely for the explaining and for the
   enforcing of things upon, the dull and sluggish minds of men. The state
   of this apostate world doth most manifestly require it, yea and even
   with the best, those that are upon recovery, who are in some mea sure
   restored out of the common apostasy, they do still need to be
   continually administered unto. And that being supposed, it is the
   business of them who are invested with such an office, to be
   continually searching for others, and labouring diligently to explain
   things to them, and to lay things together, and to apply them to
   particular uses and purposes as the variety of cases should need and
   require. And to add no more,

   3. Whereas the bounty and goodness of God hath provided for the
   inhabitants of this earth, that the bowels of it should be replenished
   with things of very great usefulness and very great value, as gold,
   silver, precious stones and the like that are dug out of the earth, it
   might as reasonably be said, Why did not God so order the matter, that
   upon turning up of the earth, one might have found vessels of gold,
   flagons and dishes of silver ready made and formed? and why have we not
   our rubies and diamonds ready cut and polished, as they are taken out
   of the earth? These Scriptures do contain all needful truths in the
   ore, from whence they are to be beaten out. And what! is nothing to be
   left to the industry and diligence of those that are to be employed
   here a lifetime, in reference to the concernments of their salvation
   and the affairs of another world? must every one expect that food of
   this kind should drop into his mouth when, even in reference to the
   support of this perishing life, it seemed a just and equal law to the
   universal Lawgiver, that he that would not labour should not eat?

   And therefore, now to make some brief Use of what hath been said upon
   this subject. It may be improved several ways.

   1 It may very reasonably put us upon reflection, what our temper and
   what our practice hath been and is, in reference to these sacred
   writings. And,

   (1.) Let us reflect, and bethink ourselves: Are they used, are they
   perused as so sacred, so important and necessary things do require to
   be? Pray let us reflect, Are they much in our hands in our closets? do
   we lay it as a charge upon ourselves to search the Scriptures? You see
   it is given as a charge by our Lord himself, "Search the Scriptures,
   for in them ye think ye have eternal life." John v. 39. Is the reading
   of them in our families a common practice? You do best know. There is
   such a thing as family instruction charged upon family masters. They
   are to be accountable for those under their charge in this very thing.
   And certainly they that do but use a very ordinary understanding, would
   soon and easily apprehend, that I who am to maintain the lives of so
   many persons in my family under my care, by providing food for them for
   their natural lives, that I who am not to suffer a child or a servant
   to starve under my roof, must not surely let their sours starve: I must
   not let the necessary means of spiritual and eternal life be withheld
   from them. Let it be considered, Is such a course kept up? If there
   must be family instruction, this word must be the ground of it, it must
   be all fetched from hence. And how sad, how unaccountable a case is it,
   when it shall be more ordinary and familiar to have a news-book (not to
   say a play-book) in men's hands, and under their eye than this holy
   book. But we are to inquire too,

   (2.) Not only concerning the reading and perusing of these writings,
   but concerning the gust, the savour and relish where with we do it.
   With what complacency do we look into and resolve in our hearts those
   great and deep things of God that are contained and unfolded to us in
   this book? I would fain know, who of us can assign a reason why David
   should have a pleasanter relish of the word of God than we? Is it not
   of as great importance to us, as k could have been to any saint
   heretofore, to take these sacred truths and doctrines that are
   contained in this book for our meat and drink? "I found thy words and
   did eat them," saith the prophet, "and they were to me the joy and
   rejoicing of my heart." We have it given us as the common character of
   a good man, a fearer of the Lord of old, that the law of God was his
   delight, and therein he did meditate, day and night. Psal. i. 2. Let us
   but consider, if there be a failure and decay generally among us as to
   one thing, that is, the want of a savouring and relishing the word of
   God, the things contained in the sacred writings, whether there be not
   a matter of threatening abode and import to us in it, for then all our
   religion is proportionably languishing, and the languishment of it is a
   continual tendency to its being lost, and continual sickness and
   languishing is a tendency to death; and in such reflections as these,
   we should compare present time with former time, so far as it any way
   comes within the compass of our knowledge, either of what we could
   either of us have observed ourselves, or what is recorded to us by
   others. Sure the time was, that the word of God hath been a thing of
   much higher esteem (I doubt) than at present. I am very apt to think
   and do pretty certainly know, that the reading of the Bible in London
   was a much more common usage than now it is in families and closets.
   And truly, if there be symptoms of decay upon us in respect of so very
   important a thing as this is, it looks very threateningly: we may be
   sure if our esteem grow less of this book, God's esteem doth not grow
   less of it: he doth not measure by us: and if he have the same estimate
   and value for it that ever he had, we may fear that he will some time
   or other (and we know not how soon} very terribly vindicate the
   neglect, contempt and disregard of these sacred records. If he do come
   to plead his own cause, in this regard, with an untoward generation, I
   fear it will be a very terrible day: I know not who will live when God
   doth this. But,

   2. This should exhort us to several things. As,

   (1.) That we do with serious gratitude acknowledge and adore the
   goodness of God, in entrusting us with such a treasure as these Oracles
   of his are. I am afraid this is a thing wherein there is a very general
   neglect and defect. We do not often enough put it into our express
   thanksgivings, that God hath vouchsafed the great blessing of a Bible
   among us. I doubt we do not explicitly enough take notice of this, as a
   matter of gratitude to God, nor so often as we should that he hath put
   this book into our hands. And,

   (2.) It should exhort us to more frequent and diligent reading of the
   Scriptures. For what have we them for? And indeed we do but mock God
   when we give thanks for them, if we use them not. It should be more a
   business with us'; time should be chosen and reserved for it on
   purpose. We should contrive how to spare time from our common affairs
   for the perusal of this book. I am afraid that partly between the
   over-much business of the shop and the exchange, and partly through the
   no-business of the coffee house and tavern, little or no time is
   allowed for this important work, the reading and perusing diligently
   these holy writings.

   (3.) And we should be exhorted next, to endeavour to get them written
   over again in our hearts: that this word may be to us an ingrafted
   word: that we may have this word of Christ dwelling richly in us: that
   we may be the epistles of Christ, written not with ink on paper, but
   with the Spirit of the living God on the fleshly tables of our hearts:
   otherwise this word cannot but be a witness against us. If there be not
   a correspondent word within, if there be not an internal correspondent
   word, the external word must be a standing witness against the frame of
   our spirits and against our habitual inclination. We then have the word
   of Christ dwelling richly in us, when it transforms and changes us, and
   when we are like it, when there is something within us answerable to
   it, as face answers to face in the water. And,

   (4.) It ought, in order to this, further to exhort us to endeavour
   distinctly to understand it; especially in those great things that do
   concern the vitals and essentials of religion. And this knowledge will
   be easy to them that concern themselves to understand. Wisdom is easy
   to him that hath understanding, that is, that sets his mind to
   understand, that doth aim at understanding. It must be a design driven
   and pursued accordingly, that we may get our minds enriched with that
   knowledge that is wrapt up in these holy writings. And we have greater
   advantages in order to it, yea much greater than our forefathers have
   had, though they have expressed that love to this book, which I am
   afraid is too little common in our time. How dear was a leaf of the
   Bible to some of the poor suffering martyrs! But, I say, we have much
   greater advantage to help us to a distinct understanding of it. How
   many very useful commentaries upon the Bible, are there published among
   us in the English tongue, which were not in the former time? As
   particularly the Dutch annotations, and Diodati's annotations, and
   those that are called the Assembly's annotations and Mr. Poole's, in
   two volumes, and that lesser and very useful one of Mr. Clarke, single.
   So that they must owe it to their own great neglect and
   unconcernedness, who are not furnished with help at hand whereby they
   may in some measure understand the Bible distinctly as they read it,
   and know how to refer things to their use from day to day as they go on
   in that course. And then,

   (5.) Lastly, apply it to the several uses it was written for and was
   designed to serve. You see here in the context, what uses it was
   intended to serve, and it is said to be profitable for: "All Scripture
   is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
   reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:" use it to
   these several purposes, as the case doth from time to time require. And
   we may add hereunto, what we find in another place, (Rom. xv. 4.) that
   the things that were written, were written for our learning, that we
   through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. Oh! how
   many a sweet cordial is there in this book! Certainly they cannot be in
   an uncomfortable state, without a fault, that have such matter of
   consolation just at hand, and take no notice of it. They that go from
   day to day in darkness, and complain of their own doubts and fears; and
   will not be at the pains to consider what there is in this book
   suitable to the state of their case, and which by faithful application
   would undoubtedly in time I satisfy all unreasonable doubts, and
   dismiss all causeless fears and make them vanish, must needs be wanting
   to their own comfort and peace. It is in that respect a light, not only
   upon account of its instructiveness, but upon account of the
   pleasantness and consolations thereof. The Scriptures were written that
   we through patience and comfort of them might have hope. We that are
   following the conduct of God, and the ducture of that light which
   shines in this sacred word of his, towards an eternal state of glory,
   with what erect and raised hearts, with hearts how lifted up in the
   ways of God should we hold on our course, as the redeemed ones of him,
   having that life and immortality in view which are brought to light
   before our eyes in this gospel.

   And a little to enforce all this, it may not be altogether use less,
   nay, I think it may be worth our while to tell you a short passage
   which was not long ago told me by a person, (whose name is well known
   in London and I hope savory in it yet, doctor Thomas Goodwin,) at such
   time as he was president of Magdalen college in Oxford: there I had the
   passage from him. He told me that being himself in the time of his
   youth, a student at Cambridge, and having heard much of Mr. Rogers of
   Dedham in Essex, purposely he took a journey from Cambridge to Dedham,
   to hear him preach on his lecture day, a lecture then so strangely
   thronged and frequented that to those that came not very early, there
   was no possibility of getting room in that very spacious large church.
   Mr. Rogers was (as he told me) at that time he heard him, on the
   subject of discourse which hath been for some time the subject of mine,
   the Scriptures. And in that sermon he falls into an expostulation with
   the people about their neglect of the Bible: (I am afraid it is more
   neglected in our days:) he personates God to the people, telling them,
   "Well I have trusted you so long with my Bible: you have slighted it,
   it lies in such and such houses all covered with dust and cobwebs: you
   care not to look, into it. Do you use my Bible so? well you shall have
   my Bible no longer." And he takes up the Bible from his cushion, and
   seemed as if be were going away with it and carrying it from them; but
   immediately turns again and personates the people to God, falls down on
   his knees, crys and pleads most earnestly, "Lord whatsoever thou dost
   to us, take not thy Bible from us: kill our children, burn our houses,
   destroy our goods; only spare us thy Bible, only take not away thy
   Bible." And then he personates God again to the people; "Say you so?
   well I will try you a while longer; and here is my Bible for you, I
   will see how you will use it, whether you will love it more, whether
   you will value it more, whether you will observe it more, whether you
   will practice it more, and live more according to it." But by these
   actions (as the doctor told me) he put all the congregation into so
   strange a posture that he never saw any congregation in his life; the
   place was a mere Bochim, the people generally (as it were) deluged with
   their own tears, and he told me that he himself, when he got out and
   was to take horse again to be gone, he was fain to hang a quarter of an
   hour upon the neck of his horse weeping, before he had power to mount;
   so strange an impression was there upon him and generally upon the
   people, upon having been thus expostulated with for the neglect of the
   Bible.

   And sure, if our neglect of it in our days have not been less, it is a
   very sad case, if our affliction and resentment of such an evil as this
   should be apparently and discernably less.

   And nothing will signify our regardlessness of this holy book more,
   than if we do not strictly regulate ourselves by it as to our thoughts,
   and as to all our deportment. For pray, under what notion do we own
   this book, but as a rule to guide us to our end? how to glorify God and
   how to enjoy him for ever? It will be a plain testimony against us that
   this book hath not the esteem which is due to it, when it hath not the
   use made of it that it was purposely designed for. And oh! let that be
   but considered, its use is to be a rule, for us. Bethink we ourselves
   thereupon, whether we do really regulate our thoughts, our hearts, our
   affections and our passions by it. "I dare not allow such and such
   thoughts, I dare not allow such and such motions of spirit within
   myself, for the Bible is against them." Let us but consider, whether we
   use to lay this rule to our minds and spirits and to our walkings and
   actions, so as to conform all to it. If not, it is impossible we can
   value it according to its true worth, for it is valuable but under the
   notion as it is a rule, and it can never regulate our external
   conversation as it should, if it do not regulate our spirit first. We
   must consider that is the great difference between the government of
   God and any human government whatsoever. His government is primarily
   mental, it is a government first exercised about minds; and this word
   is the instrument of his government as to them. This word of his "is
   quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even
   to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
   marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart."
   And if we do not labour to get our spirits, our inward man, habitually
   subjected to the governing power of this word, it doth nothing upon us
   to any purpose; it is lost upon us, as to all the great purposes for
   which it should serve us. But is not this too apparently our common
   case, that if there be a strong inclination to this or that thing or
   way; or if there be a passion up that we have a mind to indulge, this
   shall signify more with us, to carry us this way or that, than a
   thousand texts of Scripture? You may as well, many times, oppose your
   breath to the Thames to turn the course of it, as to oppose the word of
   God to these inclinations. But is this to make use of the Scripture as
   our rule, when the plain design of it lies against such and such
   habitual inclination or against indulgence to such and such a passion,
   and we never apply it to such a purpose? If we did but get the
   authority of the great God (whose word this is) to be (as it were)
   enthroned within us, so as that our souls might stand in continual awe
   of him, the remembrance of a text of Scripture would presently allay
   passion, govern appetite, and check inclination, and so would come,
   with ease and pleasure, to be to us a governing rule of all the affairs
   and actions of our lives.

   And so I have done, as to this great subject of the Scriptures, which
   was proper next, after we had asserted to you the existence of a Deity,
   that is, of an intelligent Ruler and Maker of this world, to whom such
   a word as this might certainly be ascribed as his word; that then we
   might come from this word of his to have more distinct apprehensions
   concerning him. It was necessary first, to know that there was one
   intelligent, perfect, all-comprehending, eternal Mind, the Original and
   Author of all things, without which it would have been a vain thing to
   speak of the word of God. We must know first, whence such a word was to
   proceed, and that being once understood and known, then we may look
   back again upon him, and such things through the light of the word come
   more clearly to be revealed to us concerning him, than we can
   otherwise, by mere light of nature search or find out. And so to such.
   things we shall go on, in our intended course, as the Lord shall enable
   and direct.

LECTURE XI. [120]

   James ii. 19.

   Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well:
   the devils also believe, and tremble.

   IN pursuance of that design we have had in hand, of explaining and
   asserting to you the principal heads and doctrines of our religion, we
   have (you know) already been discoursing to you about the Object of it,
   the eternal, ever-blessed God: and concerning the measure and rule of
   it, the holy Scriptures, which we have proved to be the word of God:
   and that method it was necessary to follow, of evincing the being or
   existence of God to you first, before we could reasonably go about to
   prove the Scriptures to be his word. For of nothing there are no
   predicates; nothing can be affirmed of nothing. It were vain to allege
   the authority of this or that prince's edict to one that should not
   believe that there was ever such a prince: but having evinced to you
   the existence of God, and that these Scriptures are his word, purposely
   written to reveal him more fully to us, his nature and his mind and
   will concerning what we are to believe and practice, in order to our
   pleasing and our enjoying of him, it is now highly reasonable to expect
   from these Scriptures, the discovery of such things further, concerning
   him, and our duty towards him and expectations from him, as we could
   not otherwise have known, as whereof we could not by other means have
   had, as to some things; and as to other things not so distinct or
   certain knowledge: for otherwise these Scriptures should not answer
   their avowed end, and must indeed be supposed to be written in vain.
   There are things that do concern even God himself, which is of great
   importance to us to be acquainted with, that either we should have had
   no knowledge at all of, without these Scriptures, or should not have
   known so clearly or not so easily: some of us (it may be) not at all:
   such as were less capable, or less inclined, or less willing to use
   their own reason in thought, and to discern a train of consequences and
   the force of them, and how to make things that are in themselves
   evidencable, evident to ourselves in an argumentative way. It is a
   great matter of advantage to have more of necessary things made known
   to us, and to have those things which it is necessary we should know,
   made known in an easy and less laborious way, without our more toilsome
   search: or to have it said, on the authority of the great God, this and
   this you are to believe, and this and this you are to do; to have that
   which is to be the food of our souls, not to be hunted for, but even
   brought to our hands; this is a very great advantage.

   Now among some of those things that do concern God himself, and which
   it is of absolute necessity to be acquainted with, and in order
   whereto, we are to have a clear light, and for the most, their whole
   light from the Scriptures, there are especially two which I shall
   instance in, and insist upon. That is,--the unity of the Godhead,
   and--the trinity therein. And for the former of these, the unity of the
   Godhead, we may very fitly insist upon that, as far as is needful, from
   this scripture. In which there are two parts. The first, approving and
   justifying the believing of this great truth, that God is but ONE:
   "Thou believest there is one God, thou doest well:" the other,
   reproving and condemning the ineffectual belief of it: "the devils also
   believe and tremble."

   I. I shall insist on the former of these--That the Godhead is but ONE,
   or there is but ONE GOD. "This (saith the apostle) thou believest, thou
   doest well in it. Thou believest truly and as the matter is." I do not
   propound this to you as a Scripture doctrine, upon that account, as if
   it were not at all demonstrable in a rational way; but shall first, let
   you see how very expressly the Scripture doth testify to us this truth
   touching the unity of the Godhead. And then secondly, shall shew what
   rational evidence it admits of besides.

   1. As to the Scripture testimony about this, it could be in nothing
   more express. "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord:" (Deut. vi.
   4.) a passage quoted in the gospel as you find, Mark xii. in several
   verses of that chapter, in which it is enlarged upon. One of the
   scribes (verse 28) came to our Lord; and perceiving there were
   reasonings between him and some others, he asks, "Which is the first
   commandment?" Jesus answered him, "The first commandment is, Hear O
   Israel; the Lord thy God is one Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord thy
   God with all thy heart." The scribe said unto him, "Well master, thou
   hath said the truth, for there is but one God, and there is none other
   but he; and to love him with all the heart, with all the understanding
   and with all the soul and with all the strength, and to love his
   neighbour as himself, is more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
   When Jesus saw that he answered discreetly; like a man that had a mind,
   (as the word signifies) had a presentness of mind, an understanding, a
   good sound understanding about him, he highly approves of what he said,
   and saith, "Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." There are many
   expressions very great and august, spoken like a God about this matter,
   in the prophecy of Isaiah, in several chapters of it. If you look to
   the 43. chapter, "Ye are my witnesses saith the Lord, and my servants
   whom I have chosen, that ye may know and believe me, and that ye may
   understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither
   shall there be after me. I, even I am the Lord; and besides me there is
   no Saviour." Verses 10, 11. And in the 44th chap. ver. 8. "Fear ye not,
   neither be afraid; have I not told thee from that time, and have
   declared it? ye are my witnesses, is there a God besides me? yea there
   is no God, I know not any." "I that can transmit the beams of mine eye
   through this vast and boundless inane, and look round about me every
   where, can see nothing like another God in view: I know no such, and I
   know you cannot know more than I." So you have the same thing
   inculcated in the 45th chapter, in sundry verses of it, "I am God, and
   there is none else; and the Saviour, and there is none beside me:" most
   pleasantly conjoining the notion of God and Saviour together, over and
   over, that when we know this one God, we may know him too under the
   pleasant notion of a Saviour. No discovery of him could be more
   suitable, or more grateful to poor creatures sunk and lost in misery as
   we are. And so you know, the apostle puts both these together, the "One
   God and one Mediator," revealing to us this truth the unity of the
   Godhead in conjunction with what is most apposite and suitable with the
   state of our case in that 1 Cor. viii. 6. "To us there is but one God,
   the Father, and one Lord Jesus Christ. And 1 Tim. ii. 5. "There is one
   God and one mediator, the man Christ Jesus." And that place is famous,
   1 John v. 7. "There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
   the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one." That oneness
   can mean nothing there, but in the Deity, in the Godhead.

   2. But this matter is very capable of very clear rational evidence too;
   which because it is not obvious to every one at first sight, I would
   only help you herein a little, not doubting but you will apprehend
   things to be very plain to you, when you hear them, which might have
   been out of your thoughts or sight before: both what hath been already
   proved, and what is otherwise evident concerning God, will prove to us
   the unity of the Godhead, and also what is obvious to our common notice
   concerning the state of the creation; It is by the creation we come to
   have the first notices of the Creator, as you have heard. That is, of
   the invisible power and Godhead by the things that are made. Now
   whether you look to the Maker, the Creator of all made things; or
   whether you look to the state of those things themselves, you will find
   clear rational evidence that the Godhead is but one, or that God can be
   but one.

   (1.) Consider what hath been made plain, or is otherwise evident,
   concerning God himself, the very notion of God: thence it will appear,
   that the Deity admits not of multiplication, or that there can be more
   Gods than one. As,

   [1.] It hath been proved, and is in itself evident, that God is a
   self-original, a self-existing Being. He is such a Being as that he
   doth not owe it to another, that he is, but only to himself. He only is
   in being, because such is the peculiar excellency of his being, as to
   which, it is altogether repugnant and impossible ever not to be. He
   exists, necessarily of and from himself only. Now necessary
   self-existing, un-caused being can be but one, for whatsoever is
   un-caused is unlimited, all limitation proceeding from a cause; and of
   unlimited being there can be no more than one, for if there were two,
   one must limit the other: and so neither would be unlimited. And,

   [2.] It belongs to the notion of God, considered in reference to other
   things, to be the very first in himself. He is uncaused towards the
   creature: he is the first Cause. Now nothing is plainer than that there
   can be but one first.

   [3.] To whom it belongs to be the first of all things, to him it
   belongs also to be the last, and it is as evident there can be but one
   last: and as to these things that are so plain, I do not need to
   insist, but just lay them before you. Therefore,

   [4.] It belongs to the notion of God, as he is God, to be the best of
   all beings, But there can be but one best good, in the eminent and
   transcendent sense; and so there can be but one God, as the matter is
   in itself obvious, and is taken up by our Saviour, in that 18 Luke 19.
   "None is good but one, that is God," or saving God. Again,

   [5.] It belongs to the very being of God to be omnipotent, almighty,
   and it is most evident, that there can be but one omnipotent; for
   supposing another omnipotent, that could do all things, then he could
   cause that other not to besuitablee to do any thing, otherwise he were
   not omnipotent. And if he could do that, then the former were not
   omnipotent, but plainly impotent, absolutely impotent; that is,
   notsuitablee to do any thing.

   [6.] And lastly, that which sums up all; it belongs to the notion of
   God to be the absolutely universal, perfect Being; to comprehend in
   himself all perfection: that is, either formally, that which is his
   own, or appropriate to his own being; or eminently, that which is to be
   found any where throughout the creation. Now universal perfection, or
   all perfection can have but one seat. For there can be but one all;
   there can not be more than all; and all perfection is comprised in the
   divine Being. The very notion of God, imports all perfection, signifies
   him to be the Fountain of whatsoever can come under the notion of
   perfection; and which is perpetually springing from himself, and (when
   it is his pleasure to communicate) communicating from himself thereof
   to his creatures. And,

   (2,) If you look upon the state of things in the creation, you will
   find that most plainly to signify to us the unity of the God head. As,

   [1.] In the natural world; the order that is every where to be observed
   and seen; that speaks the unity, oneness, and one-liness of the Agent,
   that had the forming and continual management of the affairs of all
   this creation. It was impossible there could be that order which is
   every where to be observed in the natural world, the heaven and earth,
   sun, moon and stars, with the constant succession of day and night,
   summer and winter; and that variety of creatures, with the due order
   still preserved in that great variety even here upon earth. I say it Is
   impossible this could be, if that mighty Agent that made, and that
   over-rules all, were not one, and only one: as the Psalmist takes
   notice, Psal. cxix. 91. Having spoken of heaven and earth before, he
   saith "They continue to this day according to thy ordinance, for all
   are thy servants." "They are all in a stated subserviency to thee, as
   the only one that dost moderate, and dispose, and order all things,
   according to thine own pleasure; and so they remain stedfast and
   settled for ever." And,

   [2.] Even in the intellectual world, the intelligent world: consider
   the state of things there. Indeed there, there might be an objection,
   or from thence; which objection will be easily improved into an
   argument to the purpose I am speaking to: that is, that in the
   intellectual world, there is so great disorder, as we see, such
   confusions among men, and proceeding from that which we find to have
   been in a higher order of intelligent creatures, the angels that fell.
   But this, I say, is improvable into an argument, in that they fell, and
   are in a fallen state, those angels, and the generality of men, it
   shews, that all this disorder and confusion, hath come from their
   receding from the one God. They therefore came into that disorder and
   confusion, (which is the sad object of our daily contemplation,
   whenever we use our thoughts about such a thing,) having broken off
   themselves from the one God: from thence doth this disorder proceed;
   and, considering these two sorts of intelligent creatures, that lie
   under our notice, (to confine our eyes to the children of men,) they
   are either such as are in a state of apostasy still; or they are such
   as are in their return, and upon recovery, coming back to God in
   Christ. For those that are in a state of apostasy still, as they remain
   apostate and off from God, they make this world that they inhabit, a
   hell of confusion to themselves, which shews, that the disorder is by
   their breaking themselves from the one God, the centre of all virtue,
   and of all order thereupon. But for those, that are returning, that are
   coming back to God, under the conduct of Christ, that are in the
   exercise of repentance towards God, according as their minds are
   changed, according as that great work of renovation obtains, and takes
   place in them, so it becomes more and more their habitual sense, to
   own, even from their very hearts and souls, the one God. Then this is
   their sense, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, and that will I
   seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord." To dwell with
   God as my only one, (as in that, 27 psalm 4. And as in the 73 psalm
   25,) "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and whom on earth do I desire
   besides thee?" It is very true indeed, that in the apostate part of the
   world, very great multitudes are quite wrong in their notions about
   this thing, as the polytheism of the pagan world, (of the most ignorant
   and sottish part of it, though the wiser part, even of that too, have
   always acknowledged one supreme God, looking upon the rest as so many
   ministering gods, meaning, no doubt, the same thing that we do by
   angels,) doth shew. But where once the light and grace of the gospel do
   obtain, in conjunction, there is not only a rectitude of motion about
   this matter, but there is a correspondent sense of heart. "One thing
   have I desired, I can dwell no where, but with God, with any content:
   and whom have I in heaven, but thee?" All renewed senses, do presently
   return to this one, all are gathered back to one centre in one, in this
   one they all meet; they no sooner begin to live, but all their desires,
   and all their aims, and all their tendencies are directed the same way,
   to this one centre. And therefore now to make some Use of this.

   1. We learn from it, the insupportable misery of those that have no
   relation to, nor interest in, this one God. God is but one. "Oh! then,"
   may every such wretched soul say, "what shall become of me, who have no
   part in him, no portion in him?" There is but one God to save thee, and
   thou hast nothing to do with him: but one God to satisfy thee, and thou
   hast nothing to do with him: but one to save thee, and if he will
   destroy thee, who will save thee? If there be but one, and he be set
   against thee, if he be thine enemy; if this be the state of thy case,
   that thou liest open to the destructive wrath of this one God, who
   shall save thee? There is but one Lawgiver, who issuitablee to save and
   to destroy; (as it comes in after, James iv. 12.) and there is but one
   to satisfy thee: thou was lost for want of being satisfied, by a
   suitable good: if thou wert never so safe from any external, any
   vindictive evil. There is but one good, that is God; no proportionable
   good, nor adequate good besides, no good that can fill up the capacity
   of the soul. How may such a creature go, bemoaning itself in so sad a
   state of its case! "There is but one good, throughout the whole
   universe of being, and I have nothing to do with that one; I have no
   part there."

   2. As the misery of such, is insupportable, so truly, their sin is as
   inexcusable: for there is but one God that claims obedience and duty
   from thee. The case is in this easy way to be understood. Let it be
   considered, you have not one to command, and another to countermand;
   one to bid, and another to forbid. There is one God: you know there is
   but one: you believe there is but one. No man (it is true) can serve
   two masters, who should both lay claim to supreme power over him. No
   one can serve two, but sure one may serve one, when there is but one,
   and his mind is express and plain; therefore the sin of such is
   altogether inexcusable. Thou hast but one God to worship; and what! not
   worship him. But one God to love, but one to fear, but one to trust:
   but one object for thy adoration, one object for thy expectation: and
   thou art to do him homage every day, in both together; both in adoring
   him and expecting from him. And what! to rob this one God of the glory,
   the service which he claims, and which thou mightest pay, and render to
   him! There is no exception against it, no counter claim, against this
   claim of his.

   3. We further learn hence, how high and great is the privilege of
   those, that do belong to God, in that he is but one: they do not need
   to be divided among many, and to have their hearts distracted within
   them, "Whither shall I go? to whom shall I betake myself?" Their
   privilege is great, upon this account, with respect both to their
   knowledge of this one God, and their application to him, the former
   whereof, leads to the latter.

   (1.) In respect to their knowledge of him; it is a very great
   privilege, that the eye of their mind and soul is called to one,
   directed to one: here is eternal life summed up (as it were) in one
   glance. "This is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and
   Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent;" to know him as he is revealed, and
   as he is to be conversed with, through his Son: and in what a
   transport, do we find the disciples, upon this account, it being the
   great business and design of our blessed Lord to reveal the Father to
   poor souls. "Shew us the Father and it sufficeth," say they. Saith he,
   "You do know the Father, in that you have known me," in that 14 John.
   Then saith one of them, Judas, not Iscariot, (no not he, I warrant you,
   he had not a heart to savour any such thing,) "How is it that thou wilt
   manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?" Oh! how lamentable is
   it to think (as if they had said) of the sad state of the blinded
   world, how little they know, how obscure and dark their notices are and
   how corrupted and depraved about the one Godhead. But Christ tells
   them, that in manifesting himself he manifested the Father too. And
   "Oh! (say they) whence is this to us, that we should have this
   manifestation when it is not afforded to the world, is not made common
   to the universality of men? And,

   (2.) In respect of application to him; Oh, how great is the privilege
   not to be put to worship stocks and stones for deities and to pray to a
   god that cannot save. When we think of the inanimate, senseless gods
   which the blind nations do trust in and worship, we have then just
   cause to think with ourselves, "Oh, how unlike to them is the portion
   of Jacob! He is the Former of all things. Our God hath made the
   heavens, and doth whatsoever he will, there above and here below."

   4. We hence sec what obligation is upon us to singleness of heart. The
   Deity wherewith we have most of all to do, finally, terminatively to
   do, is single, is but one. How to be abhorred a thing, hereupon, must a
   double heart be, a heart--and a heart! For a single God, how suitable
   is a single heart! There is not for us a God--and a God. And what
   should we do then for a heart--and a heart? The whole must go to the
   whole, one to one. When our Saviour had been telling us, (Matt. vi.
   24.) "No man can serve two masters," he points us back to what we find
   there in the same context: that if the eye be single, the whole body
   will be full of light. But if the eye be evil, (which implies that a
   double heart is an evil heart,) then all is in darkness. And saith he,
   "If the very light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that
   darkness?" When our eye looks with one direct and undivided view
   towards the one God, here the soul is all replenished with light,
   clear, and vital light, that is transfused through it. But multiplicity
   and darkness come all to one. If we do not look with a single eye to
   that one single Being, where all glory and all blessedness for poor
   souls reside; but are looking to other things, and departing from this
   one, we are presently lost in multiplicity, and see many things under
   that notion, as if our good lay here, or as if the prime duty lay here,
   it is all one as seeing nothing, as good to know nothing of any God at
   all, as to know many gods, or to consider many under that notion. And
   again,

   5. We see hereupon how possible the most entire and intimate union with
   God is with sincere souls. To those that are sincere, if he be but one,
   how entire and intimate may the union be between one and one? When we
   bring to him a single soul, a soul full of simplicity, uprightness and
   sincerity, which points only at him as the one God, he being but one,
   and we but one in the intention and aim of our souls, how entire and
   intimate may this union be! That which some pagans have expressed by
   that nearest and closest and most intimate touch of the centre; centre
   to centre, so (have some of them said) are souls to apply themselves
   inwardly to God; the one God joining centre with them. And it is a
   mighty so lace to think of it: that whereas the felicity of a soul doth
   so absolutely depend upon the most near and intimate union with God,
   that which is so necessary is so possible. It is necessary to me, in
   order to my happiness and well being, that I be most intimately and
   entirely united with God; and since he is but one, if I be one in the
   intent and bent of my soul towards him, it is not more necessary than
   possible. For observe how the scribe, that puts that question to our
   Lord in that forementioned Mark xii. understands this conjunction, when
   our Lord answered him, what was the first and great commandment;
   namely, "the first and great commandment is, that God is but one, and
   that there is no other God but he, and that therefore we should love
   him, with all the heart," he replies, "Master thou hast said well, for
   there is but one God:" and our Lord, it is said, observed, that he
   answered like a man of sense, like a man of understanding, like an
   intelligent man. There lies the connexion, (f therefore thou shalt love
   the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, because the Lord our God, is one
   God, and there is none other but he." And,

   6. We may hence collect the mighty obligation there is upon Christians,
   to unity with one another; to be united one with another. Those several
   unities you read of, Ephes. 4. are all directed to this one purpose,
   and this is the prime and most fundamental of all the rest, "There is
   but one God;" and therefore are all those related to him, and that bear
   his name, to be but one. It cannot be said, one christian hath one God,
   and another hath another God: but all have but one God; so that it is
   impossible there can be any so great reasons for disunion among
   christians, those that are sincere, that have vital union with God in
   Christ, as there are for their union. Whatsoever pretence there can be
   for disunion, or for distinct communion, the reason is unspeakably
   greater for union. By how much doth God outweigh all things else, in
   finite reason is there for oneness in communion throughout, as he, with
   whom they have all a common union is infinite. But the things, wherein
   they differ from one another, are most minutely finite, and even as
   nothing, in comparison of this one thing, wherein they must all
   (whether they will or not) agree. And thereupon indeed, there cannot be
   a greater iniquity in the Christian church (which is the community of
   living christians) than when they do usually make distinct communions.
   This I must tell you, is the very heart and centre of all
   anti-christianism, the first remarkable thing in the apostasy of the
   Christian church, when it began to degenerate, that is, the making of
   distinct communions, or making of other terms of communion, than Christ
   had made by the evangelical law. This was the very heart of all
   anti-christianity, when men would take upon them to make distinct
   boundaries and terms of communion, which should be larger than Christ
   would have made, or narrower than Christ had made: to admit men upon
   such terms as his rules would admit none; and exclude men on such terms
   as his rules would exclude none; this is the first thing, the summary
   and most comprehensive thing, in all anti-christianity. Then the
   Christian church, first began to be anti-christian, when it came to
   this, to make other terms of communion, than Christ had made, by his
   own law. And indeed, the iniquity of it, is intolerable, if it be
   considered; for under what notion, are any to be received into the
   community of Christians, but under the notion of persons visibly united
   to God in Christ, and so instated into the blessings of the gospel, and
   so entitled to everlasting blessedness in God, procured for them by the
   general Redeemer? Whereupon, to make new terms of communion, larger or
   narrower than Christ made, is to make a new covenant, to make a new
   gospel: it is to make new terms of everlasting life and death; and so
   to overturn and overthrow all things, that are most essential to a
   Christian church, or to the Christian religion, or any thing of
   religion in the world. It would strike at all, if men may shape their
   communion, according to their own fancy, when they are to shape it
   according to the evangelical law. Those that we believe to have vital
   union with God in Christ, or whom we ought to believe have so; we that
   with a sincere mind, look upon persons by gospel measures, and consider
   them as those who have visible characters of true vivid Christianity
   upon them ought to run into communion with them as such, and only such.
   This is Christ's measure, and Christ's rule, and so communion can be
   but one, and to offer to make it diverse and distinct, is to make a new
   gospel, and a new Christ, and a new religion throughout. Indeed it is a
   bold thing; for it is to make new terms of life and death. It is
   presumptuous enough to put the divine stamp upon this or that truth of
   ours, or this or that duty (as we count it) of our own; it is a great
   presumption: but unspeakably greater, to make new terms of life and
   death: for every truth, or every duty, are not parts of the terms of
   life and death. There is many a truth that is not necessary for a man
   to believe, under pain of damnation; and many a duty a man may be
   ignorant of, and so not bound to do, upon pain of damnation. But the
   terms upon which christians are to hold communion one with another, are
   such, to which we are bound under that penalty, or which are to be
   looked upon, as entitling them to be interested in salvation, or
   exempted from damnation: and so to make new terms of communion, is to
   make new terms of life and death. But blessed be God, though this hath
   been too little considered for above forty years past, God is awakening
   his people, to consider it now. And I look upon that to be the first
   step towards the restitution of the Christian church, and the
   recovering of it, out of the terrible apostasy in which it hath Iain
   for a thousand years, and upwards. This, I say, is the first step
   towards it, to make those the terms of union, and communion in the
   Christian church, which God in Christ hath made. And when that once
   comes to obtain generally, then we shall find the spirit of the body,
   (for there is but one body and one spirit) diffusing and influencing
   itself through the body, and making it lively, a kind of resurrection
   from the dead. It may further,

   7. Be collected, that our encouragement is great, as to what
   expectation we may have, concerning the issue of things, since God is
   but one. That is, concerning the issue which things shall drive to here
   in this world, and concerning their ultimate and final issue in. the
   other world, it cannot but be good and happy; for God is but one, who
   in his Christ is the universal and only Ruler of all this world. If the
   kingdom of God in Christ were divided, it would come to nothing; but it
   is not divided, it is all in one hand, who hath the ordering and
   disposing of the times and seasons, as seems good to him, and he doth
   every thing with that profound wisdom that cannot err, and that mighty
   power, that cannot be withstood. And since the most perfect wisdom, and
   most absolute power, do belong to that one; and all affairs do lie in
   one hand, the issue will certainly be good. I cannot say it will be
   good to us, according to our fancy and our sense of things, but it must
   be, in itself, good. The kingdom is not divided, there is but one God,
   and one Christ, who governs this apostate world, by his own right, as
   God, and by a right, that he hath devolved upon him, as the Mediator.
   And therefore, never doubt concerning the issue of things, let them
   look never so horridly, and with never so confused an aspect; all will
   do well, for all is in the hand of one God.

   And then, as to the final state, what transports should we be in, to
   think, when all that belongs to this one God, shall meet in this one
   God, the many sons brought to glory together, when God shall be all in
   all, one in all, one diffusing a vital, satisfying, beatifying
   influence through all, through the whole community, that relates to
   him, and is united to him, all (as it were) losing themselves in the
   one God, not in the natural sense, but in the moral; as morality
   comprehends duty and felicity both together, and the very Scripture
   expressions that speak of God's being all in all, doth imply this
   distinction, for otherwise he could not be all in all, if there were
   not a created all which he replenished), with his own fulness. "All in
   all," is not as if all being were to be reserved and swallowed up again
   into the fountain Being, and that the blessed should lose their
   individuality; no, no such thing, the very words and the nature of the
   thing, are repugnant to that, but when that all of holy ones shall be
   gathered about the central good, and be replenished continually,
   perpetually, fully and everlastingly from thence, Oh! how satisfyingly
   then shall we experience the truth and sweetness of this thing,--that
   the Godhead is but one.

   And this is enough as to the first thing which we have to consider in
   the text, "thou believest there is one God, thou doest well." The
   belief of this is approved and justified.

LEC. XII. [121]

   II. But then the ineffectual believing of it is reproved and condemned;
   to believe it with such a kind of notional faith as the devils believe
   it with. The former was the main thing for which I pitched upon this
   scripture, but this latter I shall not overlook; it having so great an
   aptitude with it to help and enforce the right improvement of the
   former. That is,--the ineffectual belief of the Unity of the Godhead,
   which the apostle doth, in this expression, designedly animadvert upon,
   may be easily collected from this present scope, which is to shew what
   kind of faith that is which must justify us; not a notion al dead
   faith, such as lets the soul wherein it is, remain unchanged, such as
   works not within, such as leaves the soul just as it was. You may see
   his scope fully represented to this purpose in the 14th verse, "What
   doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have
   not works? can faith save him?" can that idle faith, that unworking
   faith that effects nothing, can that save him? "I appeal to you, (as if
   he had said) whether it can." He doth not say it cannot, but he doth
   appeal to them whether it can or no: and it is true, that manner of
   interrogation doth deny that it can, more pungently: that is always the
   intent of questions or interrogatories, put in the room of affirmations
   or negations, to deny or affirm more smartly or with more pungency than
   a bare affirmation or negation would have done. It is an appeal to the
   common light and conscience of the person spoken to. Can such a faith
   save? And then he comes at length, in prosecution of this scope, to
   this particular truth. I may not now run over with you the whole thread
   of this discourse; but immediately before the words of the text, he
   urgeth this, "A man may say, Thou hast faith and I have works: shew me
   thy faith without thy works;" that is, if thou canst shew me any thing
   that is worth that name. But I for my part "will shew thee my faith by
   my works," as knowing it can never significantly or to purpose be shewn
   otherwise. And then he comes to this particular case, "Thou believest
   there is one God, thou doest well; the devils also believe and
   tremble." If thou hast no other faith, in this point of the one God's
   existence, but the devils' faith; nay if thine fall short of such a
   faith; dost thou think it will save thee? This is the meaning
   pursuantly to the present scope. His great question is, what faith will
   finally save, and for resolving of it, his great business is to evince
   and make out, that there must be some intervening effects in order to
   that final salvation for which the faith that will save must have a
   proportionable efficacy. If it did not work those intervening
   intermediate effects, it would not bring about the end, salvation. And
   so the truth that now remains, to be spoken to from this latter part of
   the verse, you have it plainly in view thus--That the ineffectual
   belief of the one God's existence, or such a belief of it as doth not
   be get in the soul proportionable dispositions towards God, will no
   more save a stupid man than a trembling devil--And to speak briefly and
   usefully (as much as is possible) to this, it will be requisite to
   shew--what effects or dispositions our faith of the one God's
   existence, should work in men--to open to you what it doth work in the
   devils, and--to shew, that if it do not its proper work upon men, it
   will no more, save men, than devils.

   1. What it ought to work, what impressions the faith of the one God's
   existence, should make upon men. The impressions it ought to make upon
   men, must be measured and judged of, by the state of their case,
   wherein it is different, and represented to them as different from that
   of the devils. That is, that though they have been in an apostasy from
   God, their sovereign and rightful Lord, as the devils have been, yet he
   is reconcileable to men, when he is not to the devils: and where the
   gospel comes, it shews distinctly how, and in what way, and upon what
   terms he is reconcileable. The belief then of the one God's existence,
   you may easily apprehend what it effects upon this supposal of the
   case. There is but one to whom I owe obedience as my Sovereign, to him
   I must subject myself. There is but one, from whom I can expect
   blessedness: a portion and interest in him, I must seek. I have
   hitherto been in an apostasy from him, I have hereby violated the
   bounds of my duty to him, and forfeited all interest in him: but I find
   there is a remedy to be given to this case, and through the Redeemer,
   God is reconcileable: he recalls me to my duty, he offers to restore me
   to my interest. It is plain then, what impressions should be made, to
   wit, of "repentance towards God and (upon discovery made of him) faith
   in our Lord Jesus Christ:" a disposition to come back to God, through
   Christ, with a heart full of wonder, full of gratitude, full of love,
   ready to be devoted, and subject again: and so to do all, that can be
   done on our part, or to comply, with all that is required from us, in
   order to the reinstating of things, between God and us, and setting all
   right again. But,

   2. What impression is there made on devils, by the belief of the one
   God's existence? That one word "tremble" tells us most significantly.
   They "believe and tremble." Their belief strikes them so, that they are
   shaken by it: just as the sea with a violent wind, that tosses the
   waves this way and that. The fremitus maris is that which this word
   doth express, the tumultuation of the sea, as tossed by violent winds.
   Such an impression doth the belief of the one God's existence, make and
   leave upon devils: that is, it stirs those violent passions in them,
   which we must suppose the view of the one God, in his terrible majesty
   and glory, is apt to raise in his creatures, in their state who are
   apostatized, and revolted from him, and know there is no redeemer for
   them, that God will not be reconciled to them, and they themselves have
   no disposition to seek reconciliation with him; that is, such passions
   as these; the passion of hatred: every view they have of the one God in
   his majesty and glory, stirs up their enmity, and the oftener they view
   it, the more they hate it, and especially considered under the notion
   of just and holy. It cannot but stir the passion of envy, looking on
   him under the notion of happy: it cannot but move their dread and
   horror concerning him, under the notion of almighty, not to be
   resisted, not to be withstood. And then it stirs up the passion of
   despair too, considering themselves as none of his match, and that they
   are never to expect that he will yield to them as they know they can
   never conquer him. But,

   3. Why is a stupid man no more to expect salvation from the ineffectual
   faith of the one God's existence, than a forlorn trembling devil? That
   men have been in an apostasy from God, as well as devils, is plain to
   us all. That death, that is, eternal death is the proper wages of that
   sin by which they have apostatized, that is plain to us all too: why
   should not an apostate man therefore, lie under the just wrath of God,
   as well as an apostate devil? All that can be said in the case is, that
   Christ hath died for men and not for devils: here is all that can be
   alleged. And so we need do no more for the clearing of this matter
   further, than only to consider what alteration this makes in the case,
   and in order thereto, I will lay down sundry things that I reckon very
   plain, and such as do carry their own evidence with them.

   (1.) As, that there is no natural connexion between the death of Christ
   and the salvation of a sinner. These two things are not naturally
   connected, the death of Christ and the salvation of a sinful man. It is
   plain and obvious in itself, that there is no natural connexion; these
   things do not naturally touch one another.

   (2.) Therefore there can be no connexion at all, between them but such
   as shall be ordinate or made, there cannot be any connexion, without
   its being made, between the death of Christ and the salvation of any
   man.

   (3.) There can be no pretence of any such made connexion, but such as
   the gospel constitution makes, that is, made between the death of
   Christ and the salvation of any man, but what the gospel hath made by
   its constitution.

   (4.) The gospel doth make no connexion between the death of Christ and
   the salvation of any sinner, without intervening faith. "God so loved
   the world, that he gave his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth
   in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life." The gospel makes
   no other connexion between that death to which he gave up his own Son,
   and our having, any of us, everlasting life, but upon the supposal of
   an intervening faith.

   (5.) That faith which the gospel requires for this purpose, it
   describes and tells us what it is, it describes it by distinguishing
   characters; it tells us, it is such a faith as overcomes the world. 1
   John v. 4. It tells us it is such a faith as by which the hearts of men
   are turned to the Lord; "many believed and turned to the Lord." Acts
   xi. 21. It tells us, it is such a faith, as "is the substance of things
   hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen;" (Heb. xi. 1.) that
   faith that conquers one world, and reveals another. That faith (I say)
   which the gospel requires for this purpose, to wit, of the salvation of
   sinners, by the Redeemer, it doth also describe, and tells us what it
   is. Whereupon,

   (6.) Not to have that faith which the gospel doth so describe is, in
   the gospel estimate, to have no faith. He that hath not this faith is
   an unbeliever, still an unbeliever. As when we speak of having any
   thing (whatsoever it be) that is necessary for this or that end or
   purpose, it is not the name of that thing, the misapplied name of that
   thing, that will serve the end or purpose, but it is plain, only the
   thing itself will do it. It is true, you may call painted bread by the
   name of bread; you may call the picture of a loaf, a loaf, but it is
   not painted bread that will nourish you, nor is it the notion of gospel
   faith, or the name of that faith misapplied that will save you. They
   who have not the faith which the gospel requires, have no faith quoad
   hoc, that will serve this purpose, because that faith which is so and
   so described, it requires as necessary for this purpose of saving. And
   therefore,

   (7.) Lastly; They which have not this faith, being thereupon still
   unbelievers, that is, they are unbelievers in reference to this faith;
   they have none of that faith that the gospel requires in order to
   salvation, they must accordingly have the unbeliever's portion, and the
   portion of unbelievers and devils is all one. Compare Luke xii. 46.
   with Matt. xxv. 41. In the first it is, "Let such a one have his
   portion with unbelievers:" and then consider that they who fall under
   such a doom and condemnation at last, arc condemned to that "fire which
   is prepared for the devil and his angels," as it is in the latter
   place. So that let a man believe never so much this one thing, (which
   among the rest it is needful he should believe in order to salvation,)
   to wit, the one God's existence; but it doth not work upon his soul,
   impresseth him not; altereth him not, it can no more save him than it
   will save the devil.

   Yea, and it might be added, that the gospel constitution, in this case,
   making such a faith necessary, doth not only speak the pleasure of the
   Legislator, but it speaks most consentaneously to the reason of the
   thing and with the greatest advantage. Here is reconciliation offered
   to sinful men; but there is none offered to the devil: in this respect
   then (though I do not say absolutely in all respects) their guilt is
   greatest. That one who is no way suitably affected with that discovery
   which is made to him of God. considered with reference to the state of
   his case, and the gospel dispensation under which he is, such a one as
   doth in this respect remain unchanged, his heart unaltered, not won,
   not turned to God; lies under greater guilt than the devils themselves
   do lie.

   Therefore now to make some brief Use of this. Hence,

   1. We learn, that it is a supposable thing, that persons living under
   the gospel, professed Christians, (for the apostle speaks to such
   here,) may be no more duly and suitably affected with the discovery
   that is made to them of the one God, than the very devils. This is not
   an unsupposable thing, that man may have the representation of God
   which the gospel affords, superadded to all that is natural, and be no
   more suitably affected therewith than a mere devil, this is a truly
   supposable case. And that it is a case to be supposed, a thing that may
   be, should strike all our hearts with just solicitude hereupon. May it
   be? And what! Is it not so with me? Have I not lived all this while
   amidst that light that reveals the one God, unaltered, unchanged,
   unimpressed, just as I should have been, if there had been no such
   light, no such discovery? And again,

   2. We may infer, that persons may be in a very great mea sure like the
   devil that do very seldom think of him: nay (it may be) do think there
   is no such creature. It is very likely that this sort of persons whom
   the apostle here speaks to, with such smartness and acrimony, might
   very little think of the devil till they met with this epistle, till
   they were so put in mind. This may very well be. Persons may be very
   much akin to the devil in the temper and complexion of their minds,
   when they very little think of him, or of any such matter. And they are
   most of all like him that are most positive in their disbelief of any
   such sort of creatures as devils are. That piece of revived modern
   sadduceism goes now, with many, for a great piece of wit and learning.
   And a very strange thing it is, that we should have had among us a
   clearer light than the greatest part of the world have had, to make us
   more ignorant and unapprehensive of things that are of very great
   concern to us; clearer than the pagan world have had, and yet how many
   things do we find discoursed concerning the devil, among their poets
   and philosophers, that there are such a sort of middle creatures
   between the gods (the supreme God at least) and men: and that these are
   distinguished into two orders of good and bad. Nothing more frequent in
   the writings of pagans than that there are the good genii and
   cacodaemones: some of them seem not to have been ignorant, however they
   came by the knowledge, of the apostasy of the devils, and of their
   being thrown down from their happy state above, into very great
   darkness and misery. But it seems, our having of clearer light, and
   more express discoveries of things relating to an invisible world, than
   pagans had, hath served only to make a great many of us a great deal
   more ignorant, and less apprehensive of these things and more insolent
   in the belief of them than they. But it is strange that they who are so
   very like the devil, should be of all others most unapt to own or
   apprehend that there are any such creatures, or any such sort of
   creatures. But,

   3. We may infer, that it is not strange, when the cause is so very like
   between men and devils, that their doom should be so like also: that we
   cannot think it strange, that we should remain and be left under that
   doom and condemnation which sin did in itself subject them to: who when
   God hath made overtures to them, to distinguish them from these evil
   spirits, will not be distinguished, but rather choose to sort
   themselves with devils than with returning souls, souls that are
   willing to return to God through Christ.

   We see the terrible estate of devils, that they cannot own the one
   God's existence without trembling. A frightful thought it is to them,
   to have the eternal Being always in view, that is, what he is
   necessarily, without variableness or shadow of turning: they cannot
   nullify his being, they cannot shake his throne, they cannot alter his
   nature: the glorious, bright, majestic Object is always in view, and
   they can never look towards it without dread and astonishment.
   Whatsoever little respite they may have, which those words imply, "Art
   thou come to torment us before our time?" it doth yet signify, that any
   thought of God was dreadful to them, as importing that state of torment
   that was approaching, was drawing on, wherein it will be let forth on
   them, wherein wrath will come upon them (as it must upon unreconciled
   men) to the uttermost. But,

   5. How wonderful is the grace of God towards poor sinful men, that
   their case doth admit, and may admit of their owning and believing the
   one God's existence, with another sort of impression than the case of
   the devils doth admit of. For that is plainly implied here, and
   therefore I make this inference and collection,--that it is expected
   that men should be otherwise impressed by this belief of the one God's
   existence than the devils may or can. It is expected the faith of this
   should make other kind of work in the heart of a man that entertains
   this belief, than it can do in the heart of a devil. And that very
   intimation signifies peculiar favour and special good-will, special, if
   compared with them, though it be yet more special, if you compare men
   with one another. Such good-will is the import of those words, "Glory
   to God in the highest, on earth peace, good-will towards men." "He took
   not on him the nature of angels," or (as those words may admit to be
   read) "he took not hold of angels to save them; but took on him the
   seed of Abraham." His design herein spoke itself, (as in that 2 Heb.
   14.) "Inasmuch as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he
   himself did partake of the same." Saith he, "Those that I came to save,
   are such as have flesh and blood in them, not devils." And because they
   had flesh and blood in them, he likewise took flesh and blood that he
   might save such; that is, that he might die, that he might have
   somewhat mortal about him, somewhat that could die, that was capable of
   dying, and that dying he might overcome "him that had the power of
   death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death
   were all their lifetime subject to bondage."

   6. We may learn hence, that there is not too great a stress to be laid
   upon the mere business of orthodoxy, or a rectitude of notions and
   sentiments, though about the greatest and most important things, things
   never so great: and you may suppose none greater than this, the
   existence of the one God, the certain existence of the unity of the
   Godhead. But yet, I say, a rectitude of notions or sentiments, even
   about so great things, or that which we generally call orthodoxy, ought
   not to have too great a stress laid upon them. I doubt not but that
   there is entire orthodoxy in hell, there is very little error in hell,
   very little of untrue notions, the truth of things is very clearly
   apprehended there, even the most terrible things; false doctrine doth
   not obtain there about such matters as this, to be sure: and therefore,
   let no man value himself too much upon this, that he understands
   aright, that he thinks right thoughts, doth believe that there is one
   God, one, and but one. He may do no more in this, than the devils do,
   they may be as orthodox as he; and he may therein know no more truth
   than they know. But we may yet further infer,

   7 That it is a very dismal thing, and ought accordingly to be deplored
   much, that such things as we have revealed to us, concerning God,
   should be from time to time propounded and explained, and inculcated,
   and yet have no more effect upon us, than upon devils. How many a man
   is there, that lives under the gospel of Christ, unreconciled to God
   all his days? Oh, if there be any such a one in this assembly, How
   often hast thou been striven with to turn and live? how often invited
   back to God in Christ? But it hath signified as little to preach to
   thee all this while, as if one had preached to a devil. Oh, wretched
   creature, that thou wilt make thyself a devil, when God doth, not make
   thee such! that thou wilt sort with the devils, when. God would deal
   with thee, on very distinct terms from them! He would have thee come to
   him: he doth not invite devils back; he saith to thee, t( Return,
   return:" he saith not so to them. Here is the blood of a Redeemer spilt
   for thee, it was not for them. And if we consider this matter
   generally; Oh, how dismal it is to think, that the revelation of the
   doctrine of the very one God's existence, should have made no more
   impression than it hath, to advantage the world of mankind; that the
   state of things should be so very much upon earth, as it is in hell! as
   if there were no difference in the cases of men and devils; that there
   should be such enmity against God, amongst men upon earth, such rage,
   such contempt, such blasphemy against this one existing Deity. And
   indeed, in this, men are worse than the devils, for the devils do hate
   God, but they do not despise him: here on earth he is hated and
   despised too: the devils hate him, but they cannot contemn him: men
   hate and contemn him both together. "Wherefore do the wicked contemn
   God?" Psal. x. 13. But lastly,

   8. We further learn hence, what this doctrine is likely to effect, if
   ever it come generally and to purpose, to be believed in the world,
   even this faith of the one God's existence. What a blessed change will
   that infer and make generally among men; when the one God shall be
   represented and under stood and known with effect generally! if ever
   there shall be such a time. That is, there shall be a world of
   reasonable creatures, all centering in this one, all conspiring in the
   ado ration and love of this one God; all bowing to him and kneeling
   before him: and no contention amongst men but who shall express most of
   love and duty to their universal, sovereign Maker and Lord. And
   therefore, men are only miserable in the mean time by not having real
   truth impressed and inwrought into the temper of their spirits, they
   are only by this miserable, that they are fallen from the one God, and
   apprehend him not, apprehend not the unity of the Godhead in whom they
   all are to unite. If men were all united in God, in the fear of him, in
   the love of him, in subjectedness and devotedness to him, this could
   not but infer universal order, peace and felicity, all the world over.
   Men are only miserable, only unhappy, by holding the truth in
   unrighteousness, and such truth; for the apostle speaks of such. This
   is the true ground, on which "the wrath of God is revealed from heaven,
   against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth
   in unrighteousness, because that which may be known of God, is manifest
   in them, for God hath shewed it unto them." Rom. i. 17, 18. But I shall
   not insist further upon this.

   The next thing that comes in course, to be handled, will be the
   doctrine of the Trinity. Having opened the Unity of the Godhead, a
   Trinity therein also, will next come under OUT consideration.
