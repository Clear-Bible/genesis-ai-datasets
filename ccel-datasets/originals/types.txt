                                    PREFACE.
     __________________________________________________________________

   THIS book is not meant in any sense to be a Commentary on the Old
   Testament. I freely confess that there are many difficult parts about
   which I know nothing, but before which I have learned to sit down in
   the silence and contentment of faith, and await patiently the day of
   Gods explanations.

   My object has been, not to explain the Bible, but simply to give, as
   far as I Have seen it, the deep inner sense of the Books of the Old
   Testament, in their progressive development of truth and experience.
   These views have been opened to me principally through the writings and
   teachings of a few of the Lords see-ers, or seers, chief among whom
   I would mention the Rev. Andrew Jukes, of England; and they have been
   made so great a blessing to my own spiritual life, that I long to have
   others share them with me.

   There may be very honest doubts as to the correctness of interpreting
   the Old Testament in this typical way, and I would not contend with
   these. But I have found in my own heart, and in the hearts of many
   others, a certain spiritual sense which has led us instinctively to
   accept and enjoy this application of the Old Testament Scriptures, and
   it is to such I speak in this book.

   Nor are we without large warrant in the New Testament for this typical
   or symbolical interpretation, as in many instances the inspired writers
   there, make just such an application of the Old Testament narratives.
   See Gal. iv. 22-13;  Heb. v.; vii.; ix.; x., &c. And notice especially
   the positive declaration made in 1 Cor. x. 1-11 concerning the story of
   the children of Israel:  Now all these things were our types; and
   again, Now all these things happened unto them for types. Our text
   reads examples or ensamples, but the true rendering is figures or
   types, as can be seen by a reference to the original, or to the
   margins of our reference Bibles.

   I feel, therefore, that we are justified in seeking for this mystic
   sense in that, which might otherwise be of but little value to us
   spiritually. And I send forth these Readings to those who can receive
   them, with a heart-felt prayer that the Lord may use them to His glory.

INTRODUCTORY.

CHAPTER I.

   In the very beginning of my Christian life, I remember being much
   struck with the remark that the Bible revealed itself only to the need
   and the faith of those who came to it. Wondering just what this could
   mean, I began to read my Bible, and soon found that it was really true;
   that just as a science never reveals its secrets except to its
   students, so neither does the Bible. And I discovered that the only
   really necessary things for the understanding of it, were the felt need
   of its teachings and a childlike faith to receive them. I feel sure
   that any Christian who will come to its study with a believing heart,
   will grow in its knowledge far faster than with any amount of mere
   critical study. And no matter how little talent we may have, nor how
   small may be our capacity of critical research, we can all possess
   these two absolutely necessary requisites of need and faith, and may
   all expect, therefore, to have in time its deepest secrets revealed to
   our prayerful search.

   The following series of Bible lessons is the result of this sort of
   experimental study. They do not undertake to be critical nor exhaustive
   in any sense whatever. What I wanted in my own studies was to get at
   the inner life of the Bible, and to see what secrets it would reveal to
   my soul. And these lessons are simply the supplies which I have
   gathered out of this inexhaustible storehouse, for my own pressing and
   especial personal needs. Doubtless many others have gathered far richer
   supplies; but perhaps those which have been so unspeakably precious to
   my own soul, and so wonderfully suited to my needs, may be found also
   to meet the needs of some others. I have no desire to insist upon my
   own views to the exclusion of any others, I may have made many
   mistakes, and may have left out very important links. I am sure many
   others know far more about this precious Bible than I do. But I will
   give to my readers the best I have, and trust to their charity to cover
   the multitude of faults which, no doubt, will be very patent to any who
   look for them.

   In coming to the study of the Bible, the first and most important point
   of all to be settled is as to the position we are to assume toward it.
   Do we come as students, or as critics? If the former, then we may
   confidently expect, as I have said, that all its wonderful treasures of
   wisdom and knowledge will be one after another unfolded to our gaze. If
   the latter, then we shall most certainly find it a sealed book, hiding
   its secrets in unfathomable mysteries. When God speaks, man has nothing
   to do but to believe and to submit. The grand question then is, Has God
   spoken, and is this book really His revelation to us?

   For the readers of these pages it is not necessary to go into an
   argument to answer this question. It has to them, doubtless, been
   answered long ago. And if not, the answer must be found elsewhere, as I
   am writing from the stand-point of an absolute conviction that this
   Book is God's own Book, containing an authoritative and inspired record
   of His mind and His ways. We must come to it, then, with this one only
   thought, that He has spoken and that we must believe. Whether we
   understand it or not, is no matter; whether its revelations look
   reasonable or consistent, or even possible, is of no account. He has
   spoken, and we must believe what He says. We must receive it just as it
   is, and where we cannot understand, must set it down to our limited
   power of comprehension, and be content to wait until the eyes of our
   understanding are enlightened by the Divine Spirit, and we are made
   able to comprehend the wondrous things out of His law.

   I do not mean, however, to ignore or look down upon the honest doubts
   of earnest seekers. I know too well experimentally what these are, not
   to know that they must be met with loving sympathy, rather than with
   scoldings or contemptuous condemnation. And if it will help any soul in
   this direction, I am quite willing to confess that the difficulties and
   questionings of the generation to which I belong have not left me
   unmolested, and that I know what it is to have been compelled to lift
   up the shield of faith against many an assault of doubt, that has
   seemed to come like an army to overwhelm me.

   But I have never found argument to help me here. The devil can
   out-argue any human reasoner or human reasoning, and there is nothing I
   am sure that pleases him more than to engage an earnest soul in a
   debate of this kind, in which he is so likely to come off conqueror.
   Doubts, are to be overcome not by reasoning, but by faith. I will
   believe; I choose to believe, have been the weapons with which I have
   conquered in many a fierce battle. For the will has far more to do with
   our believing than most people think. The will is king in our nature,
   and what the will decides, all else must submit to and follow. And if
   we will put our will in this matter over on the believing side, and
   choose to believe, turning resolutely away from every suggestion of
   doubt, I know from experience that we cannot fail to get the victory in
   the end. This will sound unreasonable to human philosophy, but
   nevertheless it is a fact, and to me it is a fact that attests the
   divinity of the Bible more than anything else. For unless the Bible
   were a divine book, no effort of will in believing it, after once
   doubts had entered, would amount to anything at all. When once we have
   seen cause to doubt a friend, no effort of will to trust again will
   help us. In all human relations we must have proofs of trustworthiness
   before we can trust. And if the Bible were a human book, it would
   require human proofs of its authenticity and authority before it could
   be believed or rested on. But to believe God, requires no proofs and no
   reasonings, only a choice of the will. For when the will is thus put on
   His side, He takes possession of it by His Holy Spirit, and in a divine
   way which is an omnipotent way, independent of any proofs, He convinces
   the soul of the truth of that which it has thus chosen to believe.

   It may seem like stepping off of a precipice into an apparently
   bottomless abyss. But it is safe to step, because God is there, and
   will receive us.


   Nothing before, nothing behind:

   The steps of faith

   Fall on the seeming void, and find

   The rocks beneath.

   Such steps would be fatal indeed, if taken where no rocks were. But
   because God IS, and is in His truth, there is no risk. He that will do
   His will, by thus obeying His command to believe His word, SHALL sooner
   or later know of the doctrine, whether it be of God or not. I am as
   sure of this as of my own existence.

   But perhaps some one may refer to I Cor. xii. 3, No man can say that
   Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost, as a proof against this. In
   answer, I would refer to the case of the man with the withered hand.
   The Lord Jesus told him to stretch it out. But without divine power, he
   could not. He did not, however, make this a reason for not doing it,
   but obeyed the Lord, and, as he obeyed, the power was given. He did not
   have to wait for the power, the power was waiting for him. And so the
   blessed Holy Ghost is always waiting for us. He is given as a help, not
   as a hindrance. He is always ready, and the moment we put forth our
   will to obey God's command, He is at once there to make it possible for
   us to obey.

   In Romans i. 17, there occurs a sentence concerning God, which may
   perhaps explain my thought. It is said that He calleth those things
   which be not as though they were. And it means that by this very
   calling, the things which were not, came into being. As we read
   elsewhere, He spake and it was done; He commanded and it stood fast.
   Being God, He could thus by His creative word say, Let there be, and
   straightway there was. And since He is God, we can also -- in obedience
   to His command, call those things which be not as though they were,
   because His creative power is pledged to bring them into being, and is
   able to do it. If we therefore will but put ourselves in the line of
   His command and say, I will believe, I choose to believe, He will
   create the faith of which He has thus said, Let it be, and we shall
   find ourselves actually believing. To me this is practical, because I
   have tried it and proved it to be so in my own case, in many a stress
   of doubt. But believing does not always mean understanding, nor does it
   mean seeing the whole of the thing believed. There are many true
   believers of the Bible, whose faith is each one equal in strength to
   the others, and yet whose seeing capacity is so different, that it
   hardly seems like the same book to one as it does to the other. And
   from this cause arises, I think, most of the difficulties caused by the
   great differences of opinion as to Bible truth among honest believers.

   A moment's reflection will convince us that in our different
   understandings of God's Book, we are all like people climbing up a high
   mountain to see the view, and whose views would of course differ
   according to the different degrees of height to which we might each
   have reached. The man at the foot of the mountain, who had just begun
   to climb, would have a very limited view; true as far as it went, but
   hedged in on all sides by the surrounding obstructions in the shape of
   forests, bits of rising ground, clumps of bushes, a high piece of rock,
   or even a turn in the river or the road. And unless his knowledge were
   greater than his view, he would call the river a lake without any
   outlet, and declare that the road ended at that turn, and say there
   were no fields or hills beyond those boundary lines. But as he climbed
   higher his view would become more and more extended. Soon he would see
   the country beyond, and the distant windings of the river or road, and
   the dividing lines, so strongly marked at the foot of the mountain,
   would gradually flatten into the surrounding landscape, until they
   would be almost lost to sight in the wideness and the grandeur of the
   extended plain spread out before the climber's vision. And so on and
   on, as the mountain was climbed, stretch after stretch of the landscape
   would unfold to his wondering gaze, until finally, when he reached the
   top, he would see as far as human eyesight could reach, over hill, and
   valley, and forest, and river, one grand sweep of land, and water, and
   sky, a view limited only by his own powers of vision.

   One can see at a glance how different is the view seen from the top of
   a mountain, to that seen from the mountain's foot, and can easily
   understand that should two gazers, looking from these two widely
   separated stand-points, undertake to compare views, they would find
   that although they had been looking in precisely the same direction,
   and over the very same landscape, their descriptions of what they saw
   would widely differ.

   And it is in this progressive way I believe, that we learn to
   understand God's truth. So that we can easily see how, even between
   honest and earnest students, there may be a great difference of view,
   simply arising from the difference of stand-point from which we look.
   And this may well make us diffident about asserting that our view is
   the only true or complete one, or from feeling that those who do not
   see just what we see, are not looking at the landscape at all. Let us
   rejoice in what we see, but rejoice also in what our brother sees, and
   be ready to listen to him, lest perchance he may be higher up than we,
   and may have things to tell us which we greatly need to know.

   Let us come then to our study of the Bible in a spirit of childlike and
   receptive faith, asking to have the eyes of our understanding opened
   that we may behold wondrous things out of God's law. And then it may be
   given us to be indeed among the see-ers of truth, who see for other
   men, and whom men therefore call their seers.

   I desire to have it thoroughly understood that in all I may say in this
   book I am only giving my views; that which I can see from the
   stand-point I occupy. If others see differently, I am quite prepared to
   admit that their stand-point may be higher and their view more
   extended, and will not contend with them on account of it. I can only
   give to my readers that which I have, and I trust that the view which
   has helped me, may help also some others whose needs may be like mine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   There are many different ways of studying the Bible which are very
   interesting and valuable, but perhaps the one which has interested me
   the most has been to take it up book by book, as though each book were
   only a chapter of the one Book. We have been too much accustomed I
   think to look upon the Bible as merely a collection of books by
   different authors, thrown together promiscuously under one cover.
   Whereas it really is one continuous Book, written by one Author, with a
   regular beginning and middle and ending, and a progressive development
   of truth all through from beginning to end. That the several chapters
   of this book were written by different penmen offers no difficulty to
   this view, for while the men were many, the God who inspired them was
   One, and He merely used them as His instruments to record, not their
   mind, but His own. Our Bible is to us as really God's book as though He
   had written it with His own hand in heaven, and handed it down to us.
   And as Gaussen so truly says in his book on Inspiration, Whether the
   writers recite the mysteries of a past more ancient than the creation,
   or those of a future more remote than the coming again of the Son of
   man, or the eternal counsels of the Most High, or the secrets of men's
   hearts, or the deep things of God; whether they describe their own
   emotions, or relate what they remember, or repeat contemporary
   narratives, or copy over genealogies, or make extracts from uninspired
   documents, -- their writing is inspired, their narratives are directed
   from above. It is always God who speaks, who relates, who ordains or
   reveals by their mouth, and who, in order to this, employs their
   personality in different measures, for the Spirit of God has been upon
   them, it is written, and His word has been upon their tongue.

   We may therefore reasonably conclude that there is no chance in the
   arrangement of the contents of this Divine book, but that the Divine
   Author had a regular plan in its arrangement, and has developed the
   truth to us in its pages in a regularly progressive order, beginning
   with the birth of all things in Genesis, and ending with the final
   consummation of all things in Revelation. And although we may not see
   this plan because of our ignorance and blindness, we must none the less
   believe that it is there, and that as we grow in knowledge, we shall
   more and more be able to discover and comprehend it.

   The objection may be made to this, that the order and arrangement of
   the books of the Bible was settled by a council of men. But this does
   not reach the case at all, for the Divine Author of the book was living
   when this council met; and we cannot for a moment suppose that He, any
   more than any other author, would have left His Book to chance, or
   failed Himself to see that it was all arranged according to His own
   mind and will.

   We may confidently expect, therefore, to see unrolling out before our
   careful study a wonderful plan of progressive development of truth in
   our wonderful Book, and to find each succeeding step linked on to the
   ones behind it and before it, in a way that will give us a far wider
   grasp of Divine truth, than any piecemeal study of the Bible could ever
   do, valuable and delightful as that is.

   And, first, there seem to be three great epochs developed in the Bible:
   that of childhood, that of youth, and that of manhood. The childhood of
   our race is represented by the patriarchal period, when, as it were,
   the race was in leading-strings. They did not know much about law, but
   were like children in the nursery, guided by their parents. Then comes
   the period of youth, represented by the Jewish nation -- aware of law,
   struggling against it, trying to keep it, and continually failing. And
   last of all comes the period of manhood, represented by the history of
   the Church, when the soul rejoices in the law, and finds a power to
   keep it; when law is obeyed, not because of its penalties, but because
   it is recognized as being the best and highest good.

   This much as to the grand outlines of the Bible. We will next consider
   it more in detail; and I think we shall find that each separate book
   takes us forward a definite step from the one before it, and links
   itself to the one beyond, and that each book has, as it were, one
   central thought or idea running through the whole of it, which is
   developed in this one book in a way it is in no other. I mean that just
   as the chapters in any book on science take up, one after another,
   separate and progressive steps or aspects of that science, while all
   are linked closely together, so it is here; and also that each book
   might have a heading, as we have to chapters in any other book, giving
   us in a few words its central idea.

   The book of Genesis and the book of Revelation, the beginning and the
   end of God's record, present us with many strange likenesses and yet
   contrasts. They both treat of the same subjects; but, while one gives
   us these things in their beginnings and their failure, the other gives
   them to us in their wonderful consummation and eternal triumph. As, in
   a logical discourse or a carefully-prepared book, the author will, at
   the beginning, state his subjects, and then at the end will come back
   to the same statements with all the added light that has been thrown
   upon them by the progressive developments between; so, in this book, we
   come back in Revelation to the things spoken of in Genesis, only with
   all the added light and development that the intervening chapters of
   the book have progressively revealed.

   We open the book on a garden in Genesis (ii. 8), and close it on a city
   in Revelation (xxi. 9, 10). We see the garden a home for one man, we
   find the city has become a home for nations. Rev. xxi. 24.

   In Genesis we read of the creation of the sun and moon to give light to
   the world (i. 16, 17); in Revelation we read, And the city had no need
   of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God
   did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof (xxi. 23).

   In Genesis we read, In the beginning God created the heaven and the
   earth' (i. 1); in Revelation, And I saw a new heaven and a new earth,
   for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away (xxi. 1).

   In Genesis we are told that the gathering together of the waters
   called He seas (i. 10); in Revelation we read, And there was no more
   sea (xxi. 1).

   In Genesis the curse was pronounced (iii. 17); in Revelation we are
   told, And there shall be no more curse' (xxii. 3).

   In Genesis sorrow, and suffering, and death are introduced (iii.
   16-19); in Revelation we read, And God shall wipe away all tears from
   their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
   crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are
   passed away (xxi. 4).

   In Genesis man was driven away from the tree of life: So He drove out
   the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims and
   a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of
   life (iii. 24); in Revelation nations are welcomed back to this tree:
   In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was
   there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded
   her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing
   of the nations (xxii. 2).

   In Genesis we have the marriage of the first Adam and his bride (ii.
   18, 21, 22, 23); in Revelation we have the marriage of the second Adam
   and His bride: Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to Him; for
   the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready
   (xix. 7).

   In Genesis Satan, that old serpent, makes his first appearance (iii.
   1); in Revelation he meets with his final doom (xx. 1, 2, 7, 10).

   We see, therefore, how closely linked together, even in their
   contrasts, are the beginning and the end of the Bible. And we cannot
   but conclude from this, that between these two there must lie a regular
   and progressive plan which shall lead us surely, and by very definite
   steps, from one to the other.

CHAPTER II.

THE BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT.

   THE Old Testament seems to me something like a great picture-gallery
   hung with numberless pictures of divine truth. In some countries it
   used to be the custom for the women of the king's household to work in
   tapestry all the events of that king's reign, and hang them on the
   walls of his palace, so that every visitor, in walking through the
   galleries and rooms of the palace, could read from these
   tapestry-pictures one story after another celebrating the praises of
   the king. And just so, in the Old Testament, we have hung up for us a
   wonderful series of pictures, progressively developing divine truth.
   The doctrines of our faith are taught us later on in our Book; but the
   typical pictures of these doctrines are given to us in the early part
   of it, and we can only, I think get a clear insight into the doctrines,
   in proportion as we study them in the light of these pictures. I
   believe there is not a truth revealed in the New Testament that has not
   its corresponding picture in the Old.

   We will first take a rapid resumé of the names and order of these
   pictures, and then consider them more in detail.

   Genesis. -- The outcome of Adam, or Man, and what he is by nature. This
   book gives us the development of human nature under many varied
   circumstances, and shows how man as man, without divine help, fails
   under all. It is a picture of the first lesson that every soul needs to
   learn, and that is, the utter failure of man as he is by nature, let
   his circumstances or his efforts be what they may. It opens with man in
   the garden of Eden, and leaves him a slave in the land of Egypt. Its
   New Testament counterpart is to be found in Rom. i. ii. and iii. 1-20.

   Exodus. -- Redemption and its consequences. This book finds the people
   in hopeless bondage, from which they had no power whatever to deliver
   themselves, and shows us the redemption that God accomplishes for such,
   by His own outstretched arm of power. It answers to the experience of
   conversion, or the entrance into the Christian life. Its counterpart is
   Romans iii. 23-31, and iv. v. and vi.

   Leviticus. -- The worship and communion of a redeemed people. In
   Leviticus we see God dwelling in the midst of His people, and making
   known His mind to them. It fulfils in type the words of our Lord in
   John xvi. v3, Howbeit when He, the Spirit of truth is come, He will
   guide you into all truth. Its counterpart is Ephesians ii. 13-18, and
   Hebrews x. 19-22.

   Numbers. -- The wilderness-wandering of the redeemed, or the failure to
   go in and possess the land of promise. It answers to the experience of
   a Christian who knows he is redeemed out of the land of Egypt or the
   world, but who has failed to go in and take possession of the rich
   fullness that he sees stored up for him in Christ. The seventh chapter
   of Romans is, I think, the New Testament counterpart of this book.

   Deuteronomy. -- Practical obedience, or the Consecration of those who
   are redeemed. It is a second giving of the law and a second cleansing,
   answering to the experience of the soul of the believer at a certain
   stage, when he longs to know the power of the resurrection, and to
   enter into possession of the promises. The rules and precepts, if this
   is to be done, are here given. The New Testament key-note to this book
   is to be found in Rom, xii. 1, 2; 2 Cor. vii. 1, and similar passages.

   Joshua. -- The redeemed in heavenly places, or the believer entering
   into possession of the promises, and realizing the victory of faith.
   God's people in this book come out of the wilderness, and enter at last
   into possession of the land which He had promised them; the land from
   which they had been turned back forty years before by their unbelief.
   It is a picture of the believer seated in heavenly places in Christ;
   and answers to the Epistle to the Ephesians, Rom. viii. and similar
   passages.

   Judges. -- The failure of the redeemed in heavenly places, or the
   dangers which arise even in advanced stages of Christian experience.
   Its counterpart is to be found in such texts as 1 Cor. iii. 1-4;
   Hebrews v. 12-14.

   Ruth. -- The union of Christ and the Church. A Gentile bride was here
   redeemed by her Jewish kinsman from the one who by nature had a right
   to possess her, and was purchased to be his wife; even as Christ also
   loved the Church, and gave Himself for it. The counterpart of this
   little book is to be found, I think, in Ephesians v. 22-32.

   The next six books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles, are all really only
   different chapters of one book. They contain the story of the kingdom,
   and I would suggest that their title might be, The Kingdom of Heaven
   on Earth. They are typical of that kingdom which exists now upon
   this earth, outwardly in the Church in all its branches, and inwardly
   in the heart of every child of God. Luke xvii. 20, 21, is the key note
   to these books.

   Ezra and Nehemiah. -- Individual faithfulness in a time of general
   unfaithfulness. A faithful remnant go up out of captivity to rebuild
   the temple and the walls of the city. The doctrinal counterpart to
   these books is to be found in 2 Corinthians vi. 14-18.

   Esther. -- God's providential care over the redeemed, even though they
   may be in captivity, and He may be hidden from their sight. They forget
   Him, but He remembers them, and cares for them. It illustrates the
   truth of that promise so often made by the Lord to His people, I will
   never leave thee nor forsake thee.

   With these books we close the historical series of pictures in the Old
   Testament. The five books which follow -- Job, Psalms, Proverbs,
   Ecclesiastes and Canticles, give us, I think, the progressive
   development of the heart exercises of the believer, as to
   sanctification.

   Job. -- The death of self. A righteous man is here brought through the
   refining processes of God's chastening, in order to bring him to an end
   of the self-life, and to prepare him for a revelation of the Lord to
   his soul. It answers to Heb. xii. 5-11. It is a picture of the Lord's
   dealings with a self-righteous Christian, for the purpose of emptying
   him of self, that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.

   Psalms. -- The life hid with Christ in God. The soul that has been
   brought to the end of self in Job, is here seen walking in newness of
   life. The man who speaks here is the man of faith, and the life
   revealed is the life of trust. In Job it was all, I, me, my; here it is
   all, Thou, Thee, Thy. The Book of Psalms has sometimes been looked upon
   as a sort of diary kept as it were by our Lord, for Himself and His
   people, in which are revealed to us the deep inward emotions of His
   heart, under the varied aspects of His life as the Divine Man; and also
   the feelings proper to those in whom He dwells.

   Proverbs. -- The submission of the sanctified heart to the teachings
   and leadings of Divine Wisdom. It is our Father teaching His children
   how to walk safely and wisely through this world of sin and danger. Its
   New Testament key-note is James i. 5, 6.

   Ecclesiastes teaches us the vanity of all earthly things to satisfy the
   sanctified heart. Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of
   vanities; all is vanity. It is the record of the solemn conviction of
   a soul which has been taught by Divine wisdom, and has found that the
   world, even at its best and brightest, is only vanity and vexation of
   spirit. He that drinketh of this water shall thirst again.

   The Song of Solomon is in wonderful contrast to the Book of
   Ecclesiastes. There the world is searched in vain for an object to
   satisfy the sanctified heart. Here the Object is found, and the heart
   has entered into the enjoyment of it. It is the Old Testament typical
   expression of the truth in Ephesians v. 23-33, of the wondrous union
   between Christ and the Church, which is set forth here. He that
   drinketh of this water shall never thirst.

   Out of all that Solomon wrote and said, only these three books --
   Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles -- are given us. I feel sure
   therefore that they are full of a far deeper wisdom than the church has
   yet appreciated. Some students of Scripture have thought that these
   three Books of Solomon's show us the three stages in the path of
   wisdom. The first being the purifying stage given us in Proverbs, where
   we are taught practical righteousness. The second being the
   illuminating stage, given us in Ecclesiastes where the eyes are opened
   to see the world as it is, and its hollow vanity is discovered to us.
   And the third being the uniting stage, given us in Canticles, where the
   prepared soul is joined to its Beloved in an everlasting covenant of
   life and peace.

   Concerning this progressive development of truth in the Books of the
   Bible, A. Jukes says, The form of the Word, and the wisdom of its
   form, is a subject which yet waits to receive that attention which is
   its just due. Four gospels have forced some to notice the distinct
   purpose of God in each gospel. But for the rest of scripture, why its
   form is what it is, -- why like a man, and with man, it grew from age
   to age -- why it looks and is so human, -- what connection all this has
   with the mystery of the Holy Incarnation, -- these are questions seldom
   asked . . . . . But I would here notice one fact, namely, that the Word
   is given to us in many books or sections, each of which, I am assured
   is a divine chapter, with one special end, illustrating something in
   God and man, or the details of some relation between the Creator and
   the creature. . . . . Each book has its own end, and the order and
   contents of all, as they describe the progressive ways of God with man,
   answer to His ways in every soul, for within and without His ways are
   one, and His works the same from age to age.

    The Prophets

   We come now to a distinct part of God's Book, which seems to me to be
   to the Old Testament what the book of Revelation is to the New. Like
   that, it is a prophecy of the glorious consummation of God's purposes
   for His people, revealing the future glory and blessing reserved for
   them. Each prophet has, I doubt not, a special part of truth to reveal,
   but I do not feel competent to speak of these. The meanings of their
   names may perhaps suggest something to the thoughtful reader: Isaiah,
   salvation of God; Jeremiah, he who exalts or gives glory to God;
   Ezekiel, the strength of God; Daniel, the judgment of God; Hosea,
   salvation of God; Joel, he that commands; Amos, strong to bear;
   Obadiah, servant of the Lord; Jonah, he that oppresses; Micah, poor and
   humble; Nahum, a comforter; Habakkuk, he that embraces; Zephaniah, the
   secret of the Lord; Haggai, a solemn feast; Zechariah, memory of the
   Lord; Malachi, messenger of the Lord.

   It is enough for our purposes to understand the general teaching of
   these wonderful prophecies. They refer mostly to the glorious time of
   Christ's second coming, when He shall appear to set up His kingdom of
   righteousness and peace upon earth, and the Lord of hosts shall reign
   in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His ancients gloriously. At
   that time, which is called significantly the day of the Lord, as
   though all were night until then, great and wonderful blessings are
   promised to the children of Israel, which are, I feel sure, to be
   literally and gloriously fulfilled to them in this world, in their
   triumphant return to their own land, and their restoration to
   righteousness and true holiness before the Lord. The church has been
   too much inclined I think to monopolize these glorious prophecies to
   herself, and to give them only a spiritual application. But if the
   blessings belong to us, then the curses must also, for it is plainly
   the people who had been cursed that are to be blessed: and it seems
   strange that such an unwarrantable separation could ever have been
   made, as to give all the curses to the Jews, and to appropriate all the
   blessings to the church. I shall never forget the indignation with
   which a converted Jew once called my attention to this; and I think it
   is very plain that God's chosen people have a glorious future in store
   for them on this very earth, which has been the scene of their bitter
   failure and downfall.

   I believe, however, that while the primary application of these books
   is to the Jew, they have a very blessed typical application to
   Christians; and that we who now by faith enter into God's spiritual
   kingdom, enter also into possession of spiritual blessings that
   correspond very wonderfully to the temporal ones here set forth. There
   is a rest that yet remaineth for God's chosen people. But we which have
   believed may enter into that rest now and here, and may antedate the
   outward millennium, by an inward millennial experience, that can be
   described in no other language so well, as in that which is used by
   these old prophets to foretell the future glory of their own nation.
   The spiritual mind has always realized this, and from this cause
   perhaps has sprung the mistake of monopolizing to ourselves prophecies,
   which have so wonderfully expressed our soul's deepest experiences,
   that it has seemed hard to believe they could have been intended for
   anything else.

   With these prophecies the Old Testament closes, and the dispensation of
   law is ended. God's first covenant with His people has utterly failed
   because of the weakness of their flesh, and when next we open the Book
   we shall find that a new covenant has been introduced, which God
   Himself says is a better covenant established upon better promises.
   For, He says, if that first covenant had been faultless, then should
   no place have been sought for the second. For finding fault with them
   He saith, Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new
   covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: not
   according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
   when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
   because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not,
   saith the Lord. . . . . In that He saith, a new covenant, He hath
   made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to
   vanish away.

   The first covenant failed, not because of any weakness in itself or its
   provisions, for the law was holy, just and good. But its purposes
   could not be accomplished, in that it was weak through the flesh, and
   God therefore sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
   sin, that He might condemn sin in the flesh, and might make it
   possible for the righteousness of the law to be fulfilled in us who
   walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.

   The story of this new and better covenant will be found in the New
   Testament. But before entering upon its consideration, we will examine
   more in detail the lessons of the Old.

CHAPTER III.

GENESIS.

  MAN, AND WHAT HE IS BY NATURE

  Keynote: Rom. iii. 9-19

   IN the book of Genesis we have given to us, as I have suggested, the
   outcome of Adam, or man as he is by nature. We see here the development
   of human nature in many different forms of life, and its continual
   failure. This book gives us in type the first great lesson that every
   soul has to learn, and that is the lesson of its own helplessness. It
   shows us man tried under many different circumstances, and failing in
   every one, until finally the sad but sure transition is made from the
   garden of Eden into the bondage in Egypt.

   Not that there are no individual examples of faithfulness and its
   reward, given us in this book, but the story of man as man, developed
   here, is one of repeated and most grievous failure. It has always
   seemed to me to be a very vivid picture of the experience of the
   awakened soul, seeking to make itself what it ought to be, by
   continually repeated efforts of its own and ending at last by finding
   itself in apparently hopeless Egyptian bondage. We all of us doubtless
   know something of this experimentally. We know what it is to have set
   ourselves to the work of our own reformation, to have been continually
   turning over a new leaf on our birth-days, or at New Year's time,
   thinking always that each renewed effort would surely be successful,
   and laying the blame of every failure on some fault in our
   circumstances or surroundings, believing that, if these were but more
   favorable, all would be easy and sure. And we remember well, some of us
   at least, the final and hopeless disappointment when we discovered,
   beyond a shadow of doubt, that we were utterly helpless, and then the
   joy that came, when in our helplessness we threw ourselves upon the
   mercy of God, and found in Christ the redemption our souls had so long
   sought for in vain.

   Of all this the books of Genesis and Exodus form a wonderful picture.

   The story of man's first trial and its failure, is given us in Gen. i.
   ii. and iii. He was created by God in innocence and purity, and was
   placed in the garden of Eden under the most favorable possible
   circumstances; possessing a nature inclined towards righteousness, and
   with every surrounding that could help to establish him therein. And
   yet in spite of it all, he failed most grievously, breaking the one
   only law that God had given to control him, and making it necessary for
   his own good, that he should be driven out from his home in the
   beautiful garden, lest he should eat of the tree of life and live on
   forever in the fallen and sinful condition to which he bad brought
   himself. (iii. 22-24).

   In this trial and failure the whole human race was involved, and all
   were taught the lesson, if they could but have learned it, that man as
   he is by nature must always fail, and that God alone can make him
   stand; and therefore this very fall was the occasion of the display of
   God's infinite grace provided to meet it, for at once the promise is
   made of a Deliverer, who should deliver the very race, whose destiny He
   was to share. Had man fully learned here the lesson of his own
   helplessness, who can say that this Deliverer would not have come at
   once? But much was yet unlearned, and the human race had many sad
   experiences of failure to pass through, before the fulness of time
   could come, when He would be revealed.

   Man's second trial was made outside the garden, when he was, as it
   were, left to himself, without law or restraint. He might perhaps have
   said of his first trial, I failed because of that one law. Let me try
   now a life without law, and no doubt my righteousness will assert
   itself. But his failure this time was even worse than at first, so
   that we read vi. 5, 6, And God saw that the wickedness of man was
   great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his
   heart was only evil continually, and it repented the Lord that He had
   made man on the earth, and it grieved Him at His heart. And the result
   was that He destroyed man from the face of the earth (vi. vii.),
   leaving alive only one family, whose head, Noah, was a just man and
   perfect in his generations, and who, it is said, walked with God.

   With this perfect man a third trial was made, upon a renewed earth,
   with all the evil surroundings and influences removed. And lest man
   might say that his last failure had arisen from the absence of any law
   to restrain him, a law was now given against the one especial sin that
   had proved his latest ruin--the sin of violence. ix. 5, 6: And surely
   your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of every beast
   will I require it: and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's
   brother will I require the life of man. Whosoever sheddeth man's blood,
   by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.

   Moreover, God established with him now a covenant of promise, which
   secured him from any fear of a future destruction, such as had just
   taken place; and the human race, as it were, turned over a new leaf,
   and made a fresh start. But the end of this trial, like that of all the
   others, was a grievous failure. Men conceived the idea of climbing up
   to Heaven by a tower of their own building, and God, to save them from
   a worse failure, was compelled to confound their language, and to
   scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. xi. 1-9.

   The call of Abraham came next. God chose a man out of these scattered
   nations, and called him to a walk of separation to Himself. xii. 1.
   Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and
   from thy kindred, and from thy father's house unto a land that I will
   shew thee. It is as though man might have said then, as many have said
   since, that it was hopeless to expect him to be righteous, when in
   association with his fellow-men, and that a life of separation was his
   only chance; and God gave him that chance. He chose one family and made
   them His peculiar people, separating them from all the nations round
   about them, and causing them to dwell apart in tents, and to be
   strangers and pilgrims on the earth. But even under these favored
   circumstances, human nature proved itself to be the same, and
   disappointing failure was again the end. God's peculiar people became
   hopeless bondsmen in the land of His enemies, and the book that began
   with man in the garden of Eden, ends with man in Egyptian bondage.

   Such to my mind is one of the chief lessons of the book of Genesis --
   man's efforts and their inevitable failure. And such is the experience.
   sooner or later, of every human soul. We all have to learn this lesson
   before we can come to the book of Redemption. The natural thought of
   the heart of man invariably is, that we can live up to our ideal, and
   make ourselves what we ought to be, if only we try hard enough, or are
   placed in sufficiently favorable circumstances. And we spend months,
   and it may be years of our lives, in turning over new leaves, and
   making fresh starts, thinking each time that we have now at last found
   the secret of success, and attributing our failures, not to any fault
   in ourselves, but always to the faults in our circumstances and
   surroundings. Until at last, after countless failures, we discover the
   secret of our own helplessness, and see that we are in truth bound hand
   and foot in a hopeless bondage; and then to us, as to Israel, comes the
   glad story of God's redemption, and our Exodus from Egypt takes place.

   The New Testament doctrinal counterpart to this book is to be found, I
   think, in Romans i., ii. and iii. 1-20, where man's hopeless and undone
   condition by nature is declared to us, summed up with a description of
   our bondage in these words, that every mouth may be stopped, and all
   the world may become guilty before God. This must be known before
   redemption can be declared. They that are whole need not a physician,
   but they that are sick; and the Lord Jesus came not to call the
   righteous but sinners to repentance. It is only the sinner that stands
   in the Saviour's path. It is the lost sheep whom the shepherd goes out
   to seek. It is in our weakness alone that His strength can be made
   perfect.

   Dear readers, have you learned this lesson? Have you gone through the
   sad experience of this book, and are you ready to embrace with joy the
   story of God's redemption which will be next unfolded to you? Or are
   you still dwelling in the picture I have tried to draw, seeking to
   effect your own redemption by your efforts and resolutions, and fondly
   hoping to turn over at last the final new leaf which shall contain
   nothing but a record of righteousness? Are you in short trying to save
   yourselves, or are you letting Christ save you? Only your own hearts
   can answer these questions, and I pray for your souls' sakes, that they
   may be honestly and speedily answered.

   Throughout the story of general failure given us in this book, are
   mingled, however, as always in God's records, most blessed instances of
   individual faithfulness, which show us in beautiful pictures, the
   Divine ways with souls that really trust Him, and follow Him
   whithersoever He leadeth. In the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
   Joseph, we have given to us, I think, different aspects of the
   Christian life. Abraham shows us the life of faith; Isaac the life of
   sonship and liberty; Jacob the life of legal service and bondage; and
   Joseph the resurrection life of victory.

   Abraham's life is a wonderful illustration of the text, The just shall
   live by faith. So eminent was he in this, that he is called in the New
   Testament the father of the faithful, and is cited continually as the
   sample and pattern of faith. By faith Abraham, when he was called to
   go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance,
   obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith he
   sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in
   tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same
   promise. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder
   and maker is God. * * * By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up
   Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his
   only-begotten son, of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be
   called: Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the
   dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. Heb. xi. 8, 9, 10,
   17, 18, 19.

   Isaac's life as the son and heir of his father, pictures before us the
   Christian's life as the son and heir of God. Wherefore thou art no
   more a servant, but a son: and if a son then an heir of God through
   Christ. Of Isaac we read that his father gave unto him all that he
   had. Gen. xxiv. 36. And of our portion as children of God, we are told
   that our Father hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in
   heavenly places in Christ; and that all things are ours, for we are
   Christ's, and Christ is God's. The birth of Isaac was by promise, and
   his life throughout was a life of happy ease in his father's house,
   without care and without responsibility, his ways all marked out for
   him, and all things provided. He took no thought for the morrow, for
   his father took thought for him. He needed to carry no cares, for his
   father carried them. He had but to lift up his eyes and see, and
   behold all that he needed was brought to him by the arrangements of his
   father's love, Gen. xxi. 63-67. And so we, if we take our rightful
   place as children in the house of our Father, may go in and out in
   the happy freedom of childhood, careful for nothing, because our
   Father cares for us, with all our steps directed, and our paths marked
   out, and all our wants provided for. Our souls shall then truly dwell
   at ease, and we shall know what it is to be followers of God as dear
   children, with the unquestioning obedience and simple faith of
   childhood. And then, and not until then, can we understand the depth of
   meaning in our Lord's words, when the question was asked of Him, Who
   is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven? and He answered by calling a
   little child and setting him in the midst of them, and saying, Verily,
   I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children,
   ye shall not enter into the kingdom of Heaven. Whosoever therefore
   shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the
   kingdom of Heaven. Matt. xviii. 1-4.

   Jacob is a type of the life of legal service and bondage. He
   illustrates, I think, the error against which we are warned in the
   Epistle to the Galatians, of seeking to gain by our own works that
   which is freely promised us in Christ. Jacob managed in order to obtain
   the blessing which God's promise had secured to him. (Comp. Gen. xxv.
   23 with xxvii.) The result was exile from his father's house, (xvii.
   43), and a life of hard service in a distant country. The position of a
   son was exchanged for the position of a servant and bondage took the
   place of liberty. I do not mean that Jacob ceased to be a son, only
   that he lost the son's place and privileges in the father's house, and,
   though still a son, was obliged to work for himself as a servant in the
   house of a stranger. The blessings which came to Isaac as the gifts of
   his father's love, came to Jacob as the results of his own wearisome
   labor. Isaac had but to lift up his eyes and see, and behold his wife
   came to him, provided by his father's care, while Jacob worked seven
   years for his wife, and even then received her sister in her stead, and
   was obliged to work seven other years in order to win her at last. Gen.
   xxix. 16-28. Isaac's flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and
   men-servants, and maid-servants, and camels and asses, came to him as
   the heir of his father, while Jacob says of his possessions, This
   twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not
   cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. That
   which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of
   it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen
   by night. Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
   by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. Thus have I been twenty
   years in thy house: I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters,
   and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten
   times. Gen. xxxi. 38-41.

   Throughout Jacob's whole life management took the place of trust, as it
   does in the life of many a Christian, and yet he was forced to confess,
   as finally all such legal Christians will also be, that it was not his
   own labor that had brought him prosperity, but only that God had been
   with him and blessed him; for he said to Laban, after recounting all
   his wearisome years of toil, Except the God of my father, the God of
   Abraham, and the fear of Isaac had been with me, surely thou hadst sent
   me away now empty. Gen. xxxi. 42. The lesson, however, does not seem
   to have been fully learned until that night on his homeward journey,
   when there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day, and
   he was lamed, so that he could resist and manage no longer, but was
   forced to go halting upon his thigh all the rest of his life. And then,
   in his weakness, his name was at last changed from Jacob, a supplanter,
   to Israel, a prince of God, for said he, as a prince hast thou power
   with God and with men, and hast prevailed. Gen. xxxii. 24-31. Jacob
   conquered at last by his weakness, and we too must learn that our
   victory can only come when God's strength is made perfect in our
   utter weakness.

   Joseph's life is, I think, a type of the resurrection-life of the
   believer, that life which is set before us in Rom. vi. 4: Therefore we
   are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was
   raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also
   should walk in newness of life.

   It is a life which, from the first, dreams of victory and rule over the
   things of time and sense, and which attains this rule through
   suffering. In a dream God revealed Joseph's future kingship to him,
   Gen. xxxvii. but his brethren did not believe it, and hated him for his
   pretensions. Art thou greater than our father Jacob? they asked; and
   they said of him scornfully, Behold this dreamer cometh! Souls that
   live near to God can receive more of the heavenly mysteries than
   others, and for this they will be called mystics, dreamers, and not
   even their brethren can understand them.

   But the time of Joseph's exaltation did not come at once. The road to
   it lay through the pit, and through slavery, and imprisonment in Egypt.
   Self must die before the soul can reign unhindered. We must lose our
   life in order to find it. Through emptying to fulness, through
   abasement to exaltation, is always God's order.

   In his wonderful book on the Types of Genesis, [1] Jukes thus expresses
   it: We ask the Lord that we may know the power of His resurrection and
   the fellowship of His sufferings. He draws us by His Spirit thus to
   pray. A dream of power over self and sin flits before our inward man.
   We think a few short stages will bring us to the end, that His love who
   has promised, will quickly give us the victory. Instead of this we
   discover fresh evil, and new forms of bondage. We seem to ourselves it
   may be, thrust into the pit or sold into hopeless slavery. We sink
   lower and lower. False accusations are made against us, and we know
   what it is to be 'reckoned with the transgressors;' and even to be
   called, 'Beelzebub,' with our Master. We are wronged, misrepresented,
   punished, cast out. Until at last our souls imprisoned, as it were,
   within walls of granite, are brought to the end of self, and the full
   deliverance comes. This discipline will be, I believe, both inward and
   outward. Our friends, as well as ourselves, will think that all is
   lost, and will leave us alone, perhaps, in our captivity. But could we
   hear the Lord speak, He would tell us that all was well, that this
   discipline is really indispensable, and that these very trials are the
   chariots appointed by Him to carry our souls to the place of exaltation
   and triumph. And the believer that truly trusts, recognizes this, and
   saying continually to each thing, Thy will be done, reigns, as Joseph
   did, triumphant over every stage. See Gen. xxxix. 1-6, and 20-23.

   Delayed for thirteen years, the dreamed-of exaltation came at last,
   (xli. 38-44), and Joseph became ruler over the land of Egypt. The soul
   that suffers shall also reign. The things of time and sense shall be
   put under our feet, and we shall walk conquerors through the very
   country, where before we have been slaves and prisoners.

   Mere faith cannot do this. Joseph reigns where Abraham failed. Neither
   can the Spirit of Sonship alone accomplish this victory. Isaac was
   content to rest at home in the enjoyment of all the good things of his
   father's house. To Jacob, Egypt was only a place of wearisome toil and
   sorrowful exile. The resurrection-life alone can walk through the world
   a triumphant conqueror. It can be in it, as Jesus was, a royal King
   over all its allurements and all its temptations. It can be more than
   conqueror through Him, and can set its feet on the neck of its
   enemies.

   Surely we know something of this. We have seen lives, lived it may be
   in the midst of the world's grandeur, or surrounded by its blackest
   sinfulness, that have been untouched by either, and have walked
   victoriously through all. We have wondered at it. Could we have read
   the inner history of such, sure I am that they would have told us that
   it had been by the way of in- ward death and of outward loss they had
   been brought, and that their path, like Joseph's, had been through
   emptying to fulness, and through abasement to exaltation.

   Such are some of the lessons taught me out of this wonderful book,
   which has been justly called the seed plot of the Bible. Lessons of
   failure on the one hand, where nature reigns, and of grand success on
   the other, where God is permitted to be King. Teaching thus, even in
   its first chapter, the lesson of the whole Book, that we are nothing
   and Christ is all.

   Dear reader, may I ask thee to pause here, and before thou shalt read
   another chapter, settle the question as to whether thou hast really
   learned this lesson. Because, until it is learned, no further progress
   of the soul is possible. We have started out together, I trust, to go
   through our blessed Book not only intellectually but experimentally
   also, and this is our first step, upon which all the rest depend. In
   God's pathway no one can walk but the weak and the helpless. Into His
   kingdom none can enter but the children and the foolish ones. His
   strength is made perfect always and only in our weakness.

   And this means a real weakness, not a theoretical one, and a real and
   actual foolishness and helplessness. It means, dear reader, that thou
   must so come to the end of thyself and of thy own resources, as not to
   know what to do next, nor where to turn. That thou must be in utter
   despair as to any possibility of helping thyself in any way whatever,
   and must come to the Lord as a poor, lost, undone sinner, with no claim
   upon His mercy but thy utter need.

   And if in the past there has lurked in thy soul any secret thought or
   dream of making thyself good enough for God to save, give it all up now
   and forever, and out of thy hopeless slavery cry to Him, as we shall
   see Israel doing in our next chapter, and thy Exodus will come as
   speedily as did theirs.

CHAPTER IV.

EXODUS.

  REDEMPTION AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.

  Keynote: Rom. iii. 21, 22.

   REDEMPTION and its consequences, might be given as the typical title of
   this book. It tells us the story of God's way of redeeming His people,
   and the results that follow this redemption. Its New Testament
   doctrinal counterpart is to be found, I think, especially in Rom. iii.
   21-31. Immediately following the declarations concerning our utterly
   lost and undone condition in the first part of Romans, to which I have
   referred as presenting a parallel to the book of Genesis, we are here
   made glad by the wondrous story of deliverance for these very lost
   ones, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath
   set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare
   His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the
   forbearance of God; to declare I say, at this time, His righteousness,
   that He might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in
   Jesus.

   In the book of Genesis we have seen man passing, by a series of
   failures, out of the garden of Eden into the land of Egypt, and we open
   upon him now in a condition of apparently hopeless bondage there. And
   the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with rigour. And they
   made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and
   in all manner of service in the field: all their service wherein they
   made them serve, was with rigour. Exodus i. 13, 14. The rigor of this
   bondage at last forced frown the Israelites a cry for help, And it
   came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the
   children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and
   their cry came up unto God, by reason of their bondage. Exodus ii. 23.
   And the Lord heard their cry and said, I have surely seen the
   affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by
   reason of their task-masters; for I know their sorrows; and I am come
   down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring
   them out of that land, unto a good land, and a large, unto a land
   flowing with milk and honey. Exodus iii. 7, 8.

   All this is a wonderful picture of the stages in our experience, by
   which we are brought to know the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. We
   seek first of all to redeem ourselves by our own efforts, and
   resolutions, and continual fresh starts, but our failures only grow
   worse and worse, until at last we find ourselves sold under sin, in
   apparently hopeless bondage; and then, when all hope in ourselves is
   gone, and our bondage has become very bitter to us, we cry unto the
   Lord, and He hears and delivers us, and our Exodus is accomplished.

   The way of our deliverance is wonderfully pictured in this story of the
   deliverance of the children of Israel. From beginning to end it was
   God's work, and not theirs, His right hand and His mighty power alone
   got the victory, and He brought them forth with an outstretched arm,
   and with great terribleness, and with signs and wonders. Deut. xxvi.
   8. They were helpless before the power of Pharaoh, their cruel master,
   just as we are helpless before the power of our master, Satan, who has
   bound us in a far worse slavery than theirs; and is even more
   determined than Pharaoh was, not to let us go. Their helplessness was
   their greatest claim. Like us, they did not merit redemption, but they
   needed it; and the Lord delivered them, not because they were worthy,
   but because He loved them. As we read in Deut. vii. 7, 8. The Lord did
   not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in
   number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people; but
   because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he
   had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a
   mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the
   hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

   The especial points in their deliverance which contain the most
   teaching for us, seem to me to be found in Exodus xii. and xiv. The
   Lord had been dealing with their enslavers by showing signs and
   wonders, great and sore upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his
   household, but as yet they had not been willing to let the children of
   Israel go. In chapter xi. 1, , however, we read, And the Lord said
   unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh and upon
   Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go,
   he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. This one plague
   more, which was to prove so effectual, was the judgment of death upon
   all the first-born of Egypt. And from this judgment, the children of
   Israel were to be delivered by a ceremony, which has been accepted by
   the Church of all ages, as one of the clearest types of the work of
   Christ, given to us in the whole Bible. This type is described in chap.
   xii. 3, 5, 6, 7, 13: Speak ye unto the congregation of Israel, saying,
   In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a
   lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house. *
   * Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
   shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats: And ye shall keep
   it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole
   assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.
   And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side-posts,
   and on the upper door-post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. *
   * And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you
   are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague
   shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

   The meaning of this ceremony, it seems to me, we simply this, that the
   lamb died in the place of the man, and that the sprinkled blood was to
   be a token of this fact to the destroying angel, that he might pass
   over that household. And in 1 Cor. v. 8, we are told that Christ our
   Passover is sacrificed for us; showing that He as the Lamb of God
   was slain in our place, and that His death delivers us from the
   judgment which has been pronounced against sin. The word to Israel was
   When I see the blood I will pass over you, not when I see you, and
   your goodness, or your earnestness, or even your repentance, but when I
   see the blood. That is, their only claim lay in the merits of an
   offering slain for them, just as our only claim lays in the one
   sacrifice which was offered for us on the cross by our Lord Jesus
   Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to
   God. Heb. ix. 14.

   To my mind there is unspeakable comfort to be got out of the study of
   this type. First of all the offering was of God's arranging. He wanted
   to save the children of Israel. He was not an angry God needing
   reconciliation, but a loving God who longed to deliver His people, and
   who therefore Himself provided the way by which it could be
   accomplished. Just as we read in 2 Cor. v. 19, that God was in Christ
   reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto
   them. Many people seem to look upon God as an angry Judge, whose wrath
   needs to be appeased, and who can only be satisfied with the blood of
   His Son. But the real truth, as set forth here, and throughout the
   whole Bible, is, it seems to me, that God is a loving and just Creator,
   whose very justice towards His poor helpless creatures, has joined with
   His love to save us. As we read in 1 John iii. 16, Hereby perceive we
   the love of God, because He laid down His life for us. And again, in
   John iii. 16, For God so loved the world that He gave His only
   begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but
   have everlasting life. And again, in Rom. v. 8, But God commendeth
   His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
   us. And again, l John iv. 9, In this was manifested the love of God
   toward us, because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world,
   that we might live through Him. It would require a volume to quote all
   the passages where this blessed truth is set forth, and these will
   suffice. The fact is, God's justice and His love ought never to have
   been separated, for love always includes justice, and true justice
   cannot exist without love. And it is indeed true, if we only understood
   it, that, as Faber says, God's justice is a bed where we may lay our
   anxious hearts, and be at perfect rest.

   If for a moment we will put ourselves in the place of a Creator, and
   realize the responsibilities of a Creator, I think we will be able
   better to comprehend this, and to understand the declaration in Rom.
   iii. 26, that God's very righteousness was declared, by the redemption
   He bad provided in Christ, and that He was thus enabled to be just and
   the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. Not Just, and yet the
   justifier, as though the two were opposed, but just, and therefore the
   justifier, because the two go together. As we read in I John iv. 10,
   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent
   His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

   Another point in the type before us, that brings great comfort to my
   soul, is the fact of their perfect safety when in their blood-sprinkled
   houses. There were no ifs nor buts, nor trembling hopes, in the
   hearts of those Israelites, but perfect assurance of safety. I will
   pass over you, was God's word, and they believed it, and were at
   peace. And to us His word is, expressed over and over again in a
   hundred different ways, that he that believeth hath everlasting life;
   he that believeth is born of God; he that believeth shall not come
   into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life; he that
   believeth shall not perish, but shall have everlasting life. It is
   always the tenses of present possession and assured future possession
   that are used, and no hint of doubt is ever given. Let us then believe
   Him as simply as they did, and our assurance will be as undoubting as
   theirs.

   This sprinkling of the blood was the first step in their deliverance.
   The second is given us in chap, xiv. where they crossed the Red Sea,
   and left behind them forever their house of bondage. The manner of
   this crossing was very significant. Shut up in a narrow pass, between
   two high mountains, with the sea in front of them and their enemies
   behind, it is no wonder that they seemed to their enemies and to
   themselves to be entangled in the wilderness, and that they
   reproached Moses for having led them there. And they said unto Moses,
   Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die
   in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us
   forth out of Egypt? Is not this the word that we did tell thee in
   Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it
   had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die
   in the wilderness. Exodus xiv. 11, 12. But the reply of Moses reveals
   God's very purpose in this entanglement, that He might compel them,
   because of their utter helplessness, to leave all their deliverance to
   Him. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see
   the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to-day: for the
   Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more
   forever. The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
   Exodus xiv. 13, 14. Man wants to do something to deliver himself, but
   God puts him where he cannot do anything, and then says, Stand still
   and see what I will do. To stand still and see, means for us, simply to
   believe in God's record of what He has done. I see an event in
   history which I believe on the authority of another, as really, and
   often far more understandingly, than if I had been actually present at
   the time; and thus by faith we may see the path made for us out of
   our house of bondage, as plainly as the Israelites saw the one made
   for them. And having seen it, the word comes to us, as it did to them,
   xiv. 15. And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
   Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward. Now is not the
   time to pray, but to act. I have made the path, now walk on it. Leave
   the house of bondage, and go forward. Take the deliverance I have
   provided. Or in other words, I have put away your sins by the sacrifice
   of Myself. You do not need to ask me to do it, for it is done. Believe
   it, and reckon yourselves to be free. The New Testament doctrinal
   counterpart to this is to be found, I think, especially in Rom. iv. and
   v., where the fact is brought out and established beyond controversy,
   that our salvation is a free gift, given to us out of the boundless
   grace of God, and not to be worked for, nor earned, nor purchased, but
   to be received and rejoiced in, as one always receives and rejoices in
   the gifts of love. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one;
   much more not they which do anything, but they which receive
   abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness, shall reign in
   life by one, Jesus Christ. Rom. v. 17.

   In Exodus xv. 1-19, the song of deliverance is sung, answering to the
   song of triumph sung by every redeemed soul, when the knowledge of its
   redemption first dawns upon it. It will be found very interesting to
   compare this song of Moses with what I have sometimes called the
   triumphal song of Paul in Rom. vi., where a grander deliverance is
   celebrated, and a more glorious victory anticipated. But I shall speak
   of this again.

   The feeding with manna described in Exodus xvi. is typical of the soul
   of the believer feeding on Christ, as is plainly shown us in John vi.
   31-35. Our food is Christ, and Christ only. Not our frames, nor
   feelings, nor experiences, but Christ. And to feed on Him, and not on
   them, requires that we should turn away from them wholly, and not dwell
   on them, nor examine them, nor even think about them, but that we
   should think always and only of Him, and see nothing but His work and
   His love.

   The giving of the law comes next in chapters xix. to xxiii. And the
   place this occupies, following and not preceding redemption, is very
   significant to me. Man's thought always is, obedience first and
   redemption afterwards, but God's way is, first redemption and then
   obedience. First the tree, then its fruits. Obedience is in fact only
   possible where redemption has taken place. Israel in Egypt could not
   have kept God's law; and the carnal mind, we are told, is enmity
   against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
   can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. (Rom.
   viii. 7, 8). The first event in any life must always be the birth into
   that life. The child obeys the father's laws only after he is born into
   that father's family, and also just because he is so born. The slave
   can begin a life of liberty, only after he has been set free. And to
   demand from either child or slave, the fruits and development of their
   lives, before the life itself is given would be folly indeed. Let us
   never then say to ourselves or to one another, You cannot be redeemed
   until you obey; but let us say instead, You must obey and you can
   obey, because you are redeemed. I use redemption here of course in the
   simple sense of being translated out of the kingdom of Satan into the
   kingdom of God's dear Son, and beginning the life in that kingdom; and
   not in the sense of the full salvation from sin that is to follow. The
   redemption out of Egypt was only the beginning of the full and grand
   salvation that awaited the children of Israel further on. But that
   which followed could not come until this was accomplished. And we
   cannot become followers of God as dear children, until we have first
   been made children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

   I dwell particularly on this point, because I am sure God's order is
   often missed here, and we put Sinai on the wrong side of the Red Sea,
   and will not permit any deliverance from Egypt, until the law is first
   given and obeyed.

   The latter part of the book of Exodus is occupied with God's directions
   concerning the preparation of a place where He might dwell in the midst
   of His people. Not content with redeeming them out of Egypt, He desired
   also to take up His abode with them, and to give them the unspeakable
   blessing of His manifested presence in their midst. Let them make me a
   sanctuary He said to Moses, that I may dwell among them. God so
   loves His people and longs after them, that He even stands at their
   door and knocks, asking for admission. Behold, He says, I stand at
   the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will
   come in to him, and will sup with him and he with me. And again He
   says, If a man love Me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love
   him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

   This tabernacle, and its furniture, and its service was, as we are told
   in Heb. ix., a figure for the time then present, of a greater and
   more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, even the person and work
   of our Lord Jesus Christ, who was at once our sacrifice offered for us,
   our High Priest interceding for us, and the dwelling-place of God in
   the midst of a world of sin. It was also a type of the spiritual yet
   invisible temple, in which we worship, the holy place of God's
   presence and of His spiritual sanctuary. But I cannot here go into the
   details of these blessed types.

   On the day that the tabernacle was finished and reared up, we read,
   Exodus xl. 34, 35: Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation,
   and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able
   to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode
   thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. This coming
   of the Lord's presence to fill the place prepared for Him by His
   people, is to me a very blessed type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
   promised by the Lord Jesus to every believer, given first on the day of
   Pentecost to the waiting disciples, whose hearts were prepared for His
   coming, and ready, I believe, to be given now to us and to our
   children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our
   God shall call. And I believe that to each one of us individually, the
   command comes now, as it did to the children of Israel then, to prepare
   a place for our Lord that He may dwell in our midst. And sure I am that
   many have responded to this call, and have known what it was on the day
   when the tabernacle of the heart has been made ready, to have the glory
   of the Lord so to fill the house of the Lord, as to leave no room for
   any other inmate. May we all learn so quickly the lessons of our book,
   as to be brought by rapid stages to its consummating glory, and know
   for ourselves this wondrous indwelling!

CHAPTER V.

LEVITICUS.

  THE WORSHIP AND COMMUNION OF A REDEEMED PEOPLE.

  Keynote: Eph. ii. 18-22.

   THE book of Leviticus is a book of worship and communion. It gives us
   the results of God's presence in the midst of His people, and shows us
   the things that help and the things that hinder communion with Him.

   It is a wonderful typical representation of the truths taught us in
   Eph. ii. 13, 18: But now, in Christ Jesus, ye who sometime were afar
   off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For through Him we both have
   access by one Spirit unto the Father. And again, in Heb. x. 19-22:
   Having, therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the
   blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which He hath consecrated for
   us, through the veil, that is to say, His flesh; and having a
   high-priest over the house of God; let us draw near with a true heart
   in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
   conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.

   In Leviticus we see God dwelling in the midst of His people and making
   known His mind to them. The promise to them in Ex. xxv. 22 had been,
   And there will I meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from
   above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the
   ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in
   commandment unto the children of Israel. And here this promise is
   fulfilled. Between thirty and forty times in this book is the
   expression used, And the Lord spake, saying; and the whole book is
   simply a revelation of the Lord's mind and thoughts to a people who had
   been brought into the secret of His presence, It is an illustration of
   our Lord's words in John xv. 15, Henceforth I call you not servants,
   for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have called you
   friends; for all things that I have heard of the Father, I have made
   known unto you. Only to the heart where Christ dwells, can His secrets
   be revealed, and to them alone can He show His covenant.

   It is very important to notice that this book does not tell how they
   were to be delivered from bondage, but only how they were to live and
   worship after they were delivered. Its very position, following Exodus
   instead of preceding it) shows us plainly God's order in these things.
   First redemption, then worship and communion. Not worship and communion
   in order to be saved, but because we have been saved. Many souls seek
   to reverse this order, and think if they could only know real communion
   with God, then they could have some hope that He would redeem them.
   They think this acceptable worship would make them more fit to be
   redeemed, or would make Him more willing. Whereas the truth is that the
   knowledge of redemption must come first, before there can be any
   satisfying communion. The very object of our redemption is that we may
   worship and serve God. If we could have done it before we were
   redeemed, then there would have been no need of redemption. The word of
   Moses to Pharaoh was, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people
   go, that they may serve me. Pharaoh had no objection to their serving
   God, if only they would not go out of his land to do it; and he said,
   Exod. viii. 25, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.

   If Satan can only keep us in his own land, slaves to himself, he cares
   very little what we do there, and is even well pleased that we should
   attend church, and say our prayers, and seek to serve God, as long as
   we will do it in the land, thinking so to blind our eyes to our
   slavery, and make us more willing slaves.

   But Moses answered, It is not meet so to do. We will go three days'
   journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God as He
   shall command us. He knew that the true worship of the God of Israel
   was simply impossible in the land of Egypt. And the soul now, that
   understands God's truth, knows also that except a man be born again,
   he cannot see nor enter into the kingdom of God. We must be
   translated out of the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God's dear
   Son, before we can serve the King of that kingdom, and above all before
   we can expect to be told His secrets.

   But Satan's devices do not stop here. When Pharaoh found. that he could
   not induce Moses to remain in the land, he gave up that point, saying,
   I will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the Lord your God in the
   wilderness; only, he added, cunningly, ye shall not go very far
   away. That is, when Satan sees that he cannot keep us in his kingdom,
   he next tries to persuade us that it is not necessary to go very far
   away, and that the world and the church need not be separated by any
   great distance after all. He knows well, as Pharaoh knew, that it is
   very easy to take captive those who dwell in the border land, and that
   it is just because they do not go very far away, that Christians suffer
   so much from his assaults.

   The book of Leviticus, therefore, gives us, as I have said, the worship
   and communion of a redeemed people, a people in whose midst God was
   consciously present, revealing His mind, and teaching them His will.
   And many very deep lessons are taught here which can, I believe, only
   be understood aright by the soul in whoa the Holy Spirit consciously
   dwells as Teacher and Guide.

   The first revelation God gives is concerning the offerings, in chapters
   i. ii. iii. iv. v. vi. vii. There were five of them, the
   burnt-offering, the meat-offering, the peace-offering, the
   sin-offering, and the trespass-offering. These offerings were types of
   different aspects of the work of the Lord Jesus Christ, meeting the
   need of His people in their daily life and walk in His kingdom. Exodus
   gives us the blood of the Lamb redeeming God's people out of Egypt. And
   this is the aspect in which it must always first be known, before
   anything else can be learned. But after redemption has been
   experienced, we then have to learn that there is much more in Christ
   for us, than merely deliverance from the guilt of sin. And it is only
   in the wilderness, in separation from Egypt, that Israel is taught all
   the value of the offerings. It is Christ, as He is discerned by those
   who already know they are redeemed; Christ as the Priest, the Offerer,
   and the Offering, meeting the believer's every need, who is set forth
   here.

   Each offering is believed to present some especial aspect of His work.
   The burnt-offering in Chap. i., which was all burned on the altar, an
   offering made by fire of a sweet savor, unto the Lord, i. 9, was a type
   of Christ as He is described in Eph. v. 2, where we read that, He
   loved us, and gave Himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God of
   a sweet-smelling savor. The whole burnt-offering typified the entire
   surrender of self to God. It was Christ offering Himself up with a
   complete consecration to accomplish the purposes of God's glory; and
   His perfect spotlessness and devotedness was a sweet-smelling savor to
   God, something in which He could take unclouded joy. It was
   acceptable to God, and was accepted for the offerer, so that it might
   be said of each one of us, that we are accepted in the Beloved.

   The meat-offering in Chap. ii. represents Christ in His perfect
   humanity as He lived, and walked, and served down here on earth.
   presenting His life to God as an offering of a sweet savor, and giving
   Himself to man as the food provided for those who are in God's service;
   as we read, And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and
   his sons; ii. 3. This offering was taken from the fruit of the earth,
   and was of the finest wheat, ii. 1. Setting Him forth as real man,
   taking upon Him our earthly nature, tempted in all points like as we
   are, and, therefore, able to succor them that are tempted. It is the
   type of that which is declared to us in Heb. ii. 14, For as much as
   the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also himself likewise
   took part of the same. And the picture is full of divinest comfort for
   us, since we read, that, because He that sanctifieth and they who are
   sanctified are all thus of one, He, therefore, for this cause, is not
   ashamed to call us brethren. Our God, our Brother! Can human words
   convey a grander or sweeter thought?

   In the peace-offering, Chap. iii., the leading thought is the communion
   of the worshipper, And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
   offerings for thanksgiving, shall be eaten the same day that it is
   offered, Lev. vii. 15. It was not here as in the burnt-offering,
   Christ enjoyed exclusively by God? but the worshipper feasting upon
   Christ in communion with God. The offering was shared between the
   altar, the priest, and the offerer. That is, the picture presented to
   us here is of the believer coming to God to be filled with Christ, to
   have his thoughts occupied with Christ, and his mouth filled with His
   praises. Many souls have access to God who do not have communion. They
   come full of themselves, and their own needs, and all they have to say
   is about their feelings, or their sins, or their trials. It is all
   self, self, self. But communion means to dwell upon and delight in that
   which God dwells upon and delights in. And this can never be anything
   in or about ourselves, but always and only things pertaining to His
   well-beloved Son.

   Only the clean could partake of this offering, Lev. vii. 20, 21; and
   only the Christian whose heart is purified by faith can enter into this
   blessed communion. If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we
   have fellowship one with another; and the blood of Jesus Christ His
   Son, cleansers us from all sin, I John i. 7. This is, I believe, the
   New Testament statement of the truth typified in the Peace-offering.

   The Sin-offering, chapters iv. and v., was for sins of ignorance, or
   involuntary sins. If a soul sin and commit any of these things which
   are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord; though he
   wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity, v. 17. The
   sin hidden to man is not hidden to God, and while He can forgive
   everything, He can let nothing pass. The priest shall make an
   atonement for him concerning his ignorance, wherein he erred, and wist
   it not; and it shall be forgiven him, v. 19. The sin-offering is a
   type of Christ bearing our sins in His own body on the tree. As we read
   in 2 Cor. vi. 21, For He hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no
   sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. It is the
   especial aspect of sin in us, that is here brought out, the sin of our
   nature. What we are, rather than what we do. And it teaches us plainly,
   that it is not our own conscience, nor our measure of light, but the
   truth of God, that is the standard by which sin is to be measured. But
   it also teaches that in the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ, perfect
   provision is made for it all.

   The trespass-offering, chapter vi. was an offering for sins of
   wrong-doing, either towards God or towards man. It was not so much here
   what a man was, as what he did which is considered, his acts of sin;
   and, therefore, this offering was accompanied with restitution on the
   part of the sinner. He was not only forgiven, but he was to restore
   that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath
   deceitfully gotten: vi. 4. This signifies, I think, first, the blessed
   truth that where sin abounded, and even because sin abounded, grace
   did much more abound. And also teaches us that forgiveness is not the
   whole of salvation, but righteousness must accompany it.

   Such were the offerings, each one revealing Christ and some especial
   aspect of His work for us; and each one also, I believe, teaching us
   what we ought to be, as one with Him and walking as He walked, even
   living sacrifices giving ourselves to God, and to our brethren. But I
   cannot dwell on this now.*

   To me the one grand lesson of the offerings is to be found in the
   constant repetition of the declaration and it shall be forgiven him.
   No room was left for doubt here. God said it, and the question was
   settled. No Israelite could look inside at his own feelings to settle
   this question, nor outside at his life. The one only point was, had he
   brought the offering, and had it been consumed on the altar? If so,
   then he was forgiven, whether he felt it or not; and we cannot imagine
   an Israelite entertaining a doubt on the subject. Had such a thing
   occurred, I cannot but think that the friends and neighbors of the
   unfortunate man, and, in fact, the whole nation, would have been
   horrified at such presumption. Do you dare to doubt God's word? they
   would have asked. Are your feelings to be put in opposition to His
   express declaration? But if they could be thus sure of forgiveness,
   who only offered a bullock, or a lamb, or a turtle dove, surely we, for
   whom Christ has been offered, ought to be infinitely more sure; and
   doubts with us should be even more summarily dealt with. May the type
   teach us this all important lesson!

   Priesthood comes next in chapters viii. and ix. A type of the Lord
   Jesus Christ as our High Priest interceding for us, and giving us
   access to God. Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum:
   we have such an High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne
   of the majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the
   true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man, Heb. viii. 1, 2.
   And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to
   continue by reason of death; but this man, because he continueth ever,
   hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore He is also able to save them
   to the uttermost, that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to
   make intercession for them, Heb. vii. 23-25.

   I believe that Aaron as High Priest was the especial type of Christ;
   and that his sons were meant to be types of believers in their position
   as priests unto God, built up, as Peter says, an holy priesthood, to
   offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, The
   priest typifies the soul in communion with God, dwelling in the secret
   of His presence, and handling the holy things of His sanctuary. And we,
   as priests, are called, as were the sons of Aaron, to a blessed
   separation from all the cares and burdens of the world, and to a life
   of consecration to the service of our Lord.

   Chapters xi. xxii. give us the discernment between clean and unclean
   things, the judgment of defilements, what was to be done with defiled
   persons, and directions to preserve them from defilements. These
   chapters touch on many things in the daily lives of the Israelite,
   which were  calculated to  hinder or to help communion, and show us how
   nothing is  unimunimportant to the soul where God dwells. The food they
   ate, the garments they wore, the houses they lived in, their family
   relations with each other, their treatment of one another, the sowing
   of their seed, the gathering in of their harvests, their births and
   death, in short all the smallest details of their everyday life were of
   importance, and all were to be regulated by the law of their God. The
   reason of this is told in Lev. xx. 26, And ye shall be holy unto me;
   for I the Lord am holy, and have separated you from other people that
   ye should be mine. Sanctify yourselves, therefore, and be ye holy:
   for I am the Lord your God. And ye shall keep my statutes and do them;
   I am the Lord which sanctify you. Lev. xx. 7, 8.

   These chapters are to me most precious, because they show us that our
   God loves us enough to care about every little detail of our lives, and
   that to belong to Him means to have each step of our way regulated by
   His sweet control. To the heathen nations round about, it might have
   seemed an almost intolerable thing to have God entering so minutely
   into all their affairs; beside their bed at night, and around their
   board by day. But to the soul that knew His love, nothing could have
   been more blessed. The surveillance of true and unselfish love is
   always most lovely, and can bring nothing but blessing and joy. We know
   that we ourselves do not care for the details of any lives but of those
   we love. The majority of the people around us may live, and eat, and
   wear, and act as they please, and so long as they do not interfere with
   us, we are perfectly indifferent. But the moment we begin to love, all
   is changed, and the least detail in the life or ways of our loved ones
   becomes of deepest interest to us. It is because God loves us
   therefore, that He cares what we do, and it is one of our sweetest
   joys, if we only knew it, to have a dear command of His for every day
   and hour of our lives.

   In Chapter xvi. we have the provision made for defilement. For on that
   day shall the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you, that ye
   may be clean from all your sins before the Lord, xvi. 30. This
   atonement was two-fold. One goat was killed and its blood sprinkled on
   the mercy-seat to make an atonement for the holy place, because of the
   uncleanness of the children of Israel, xvi. 16; and of the other goat
   we read xvi. 21, 22, And Aaron shall lay both hands upon the head of
   the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
   of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them
   upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit
   man into the wilderness. And the goat shall bear upon him all their
   iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in
   the wilderness.

   Of all the types of the Lord Jesus, this seems to me one of the most
   wonderful. The way of access for the sinner into the presence of God is
   made by His death, and the sins of the sinner are borne away into a
   land not inhabited, cast as it were into the very depths of the sea,
   to be no more remembered, even by the God against whom they were
   committed, but who has thus laid on Him the iniquity of us all. And
   if that day was to be a Sabbath of rest to the soul of the Israelite,
   because he was thus cleansed from all his sins, how much more ought our
   souls to enter into rest, when we see by faith the Lamb of God, who
   taketh away the in of the world.

   The Lord's feasts come next in chapter xxiii., a wonderful picture of
   the stages in the soul's experience, which are each one well pleasing
   to the Lord, and which lead onward, one by one, from the first stage of
   coming to Jesus and finding rest to our souls, to the culminating stage
   of fulness of joy in His love.

   These feasts are seven -- the Sabbath, the Passover accompanied with
   the feast of unleavened bread, the First-fruits of the Harvest,
   Pentecost, the Feast of Trumpets in the seventh month, the Day of
   Atonement, and the Feast of Tabernacles.

   The first, the Sabbath, verse 3, is a type of that rest into which we,
   which have believed, do enter; and it must always be the first stage in
   all real progress. Come unto me, said Jesus, all ye that labor and
   are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Many other things also He
   has in store for us, but this must come first -- rest to our souls; and
   without it all the others are useless.

   The second, the Passover, with the feast of unleavened bread, verses
   5-8, typifies the assurance of faith, and its result in a holy life.
   The Passover was the memorial of their deliverance in Egypt, and must
   have reminded them every time they celebrated it, that their
   deliverance was a grand fact. The feast of unleavened bread typified
   the separation from evil that must be the result of this; leaven always
   being a type of evil.

   This whole feast teaches us, I think, that it is God's will and
   therefore pleasing to Him for the believer to know that his sins are
   forgiven, and that he has been delivered from the bondage of Satan
   through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. John says: These
   things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of
   God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, I John v. 13. Many
   have this life who do not know it, who only hope so, or perhaps fear
   they have not. But God would have us know it, and commands us to keep
   our Passovers by continually reminding ourselves of the grand fact of
   our redemption, through the blood of the Lamb. But that his assurance
   was intended not to encourage sin but to hinder it, is taught by the
   accompanying feast of unleavened bread, which is shown us in I Cor. v.
   6-8 to be a type of that separation from all evil, required by God from
   every one who belongs to Him.

   The third feast, the First Fruits, verses 10-14, occurring on the day
   after the Sabbath, the eighth day, was a type of the resurrection of
   Christ, who at the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the
   first day of the week, rose triumphant from the grave, and became the
   first-fruits of them that slept. I Cor. xv. 20. And since we who
   believe have been buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as
   Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so
   we also should walk in newness of life, this feast typifies also our
   resurrection life as one with Him, and the soul by faith entering into
   the apprehension of it. And until this is done, v. 14, we cannot feed
   on the glorious harvest, nor even taste the bread and the corn which
   are the only food of the resurrection life.

   The fourth feast, Pentecost, verses 15-21, typifies the outpouring of
   the Spirit upon the soul that has thus died with Christ and risen with
   Him to newness of life. A new meat offering was presented then,
   baken with leaven, a type of the union of Christ with His people,
   who, being still upon earth, have in them the taint of evil. All the
   different sacrifices were offered on this day, showing how, when our
   Pentecost comes, Christ in all His fulness will be apprehended and
   rejoiced in.

   The fifth feast, the Feast of Trumpets, verses 24, 25, is a type of the
   believer bearing testimony. Endued with power from on high, on the
   Day of Pentecost, we can now be witnesses unto Christ.

   The sixth feast, the Day of Atonement, verses 27-32, a day when they
   were to afflict their souls, was a type, I thank, of the death of
   self, the final and complete self-sacrifice, when all of self is
   surrendered and crucified with Christ. Afflict your souls, that is,
   mortify, reckon dead, take up the cross, forsake all.

   And this ushered in the seventh feast, the feast of joy. These things
   have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and your joy
   might be full, John xv. 11.

   This seventh feast, the Feast of Tabernacles, verses 24-43, is the
   foreshadowing of the Christian's highest joy, when the soul fully
   realizes its deliverance and its victory, and is so cut loose from
   earth as to be able to see things as God sees them, and to enter into
   His joy. It is more than the joy of faith, as at the first-fruits, that
   is realized here; it is the joy of possession, all is gathered in at
   last, verse 39.

   It is very striking to observe the continual recurrence of the
   expression throughout all of these feasts, ye shall do no servile work
   therein, illustrating wonderfully the truth that, from beginning to
   end, our salvation is not of works, lest any man should boast.

   Another expression is also to me very suggestive, and that is that
   these feasts were called the feasts of the Lord. Not our feasts, but
   His. That is, the joy of the Lord in our progress is far greater than
   ever our own joy could be. The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is
   mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with joy; He will rest
   in His love; He will joy over thee with singing, Zeph. iii. 17.

   Chapter xxv. gives us the Jubilee, a beautiful type of the Millennium,
   the final restitution of all things, when righteousness shall cover
   the earth as the waters cover the sea. And ye shall hallow the
   fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all
   the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall
   return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man
   unto his family. This year was reached by an ascending scale of
   Sabbaths, one Sabbath day each seven days, one Sabbath year each seven
   years, and finally the Jubilee, a Sabbath year each. seven times seven
   years. All these Sabbaths, with the rest they brought, being each one
   foretastes of the final Sabbath, when the whole earth shall be at rest
   and quiet, and shall break forth into singing, Ps. xiv. 7.

   In chapter xxvi. we have given to us the blessings that follow
   obedience, and the miseries that will follow disobedience, striking
   pictures of the joy of the obedient Christian life, and the loss and
   sorrow of the disobedient.

   Our book closes with chapter xxvii. which treats of God's rights in
   those things devoted to Him, and shows us that every such thing becomes
   most holy, because it is thus set apart for Him. His possession of it
   makes it holy, whatever it may have been before. Every devoted thing
   is most holy to the Lord, verse 28. A blessed truth to the poor soul
   that feels its unholiness, and yet longs to be all the Lord's,
   sanctified and meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good
   work.

   Satan continually tempts such to think that they are too unholy for the
   Lord to accept, and what he suggests as to their unworthiness is so
   true, that it seems impossible to gainsay his conclusions. But the
   answer here is simply this, that the altar sanctifies the gift, that
   anything given to the Lord is made holy by the very fact of being so
   given. And that even our bodies, if presented unto Him a living
   sacrifice, are thereby rendered holy and acceptable. Just as we have
   sometimes read in our childish tales of a water that changed everything
   put into it into gold, so here we read of a God so infinite in holiness
   that everything devoted to Him becomes holy by His simple possession of
   it. Take comfort then, dear humble soul, and transfer at once thyself
   and all that thou hast into this grand possession, that it may all
   become most holy unto the Lord.

   Such is the book of Leviticus, a book concerning the worship and
   communion of a redeemed people, among whom God dwells. A book that more
   than any other seems to show in type what it is to have the blessed
   gift of the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit in our hearts; that
   gift which is the promise of the Father to all who believe in the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and which alone brings us nigh to God, and makes it
   possible for us to commune with Him. It is therefore especially full of
   deep teaching for Christians, and contains many blessed lessons
   concerning the interior life of spiritual communion, that are worthy of
   most careful study.

CHAPTER VI.

NUMBERS.

  THE WILDERNESS WANDERING OF THOSE WHO ARE REDEEMED.

  Keynote: Rom. vii. 9-24.

   THE book of Numbers gives us the wilderness wandering of a redeemed
   people, and answers to the experience of the Christian who knows that
   he is redeemed out of the world and brought nigh to God, but who fails
   to enter into possession of the fulness of his salvation. In this book
   we see the children of Israel brought to the borders of the promised
   land, and failing to go in because of unbelief; and we see them, on
   account of this failure, condemned to wander for forty years in the
   wilderness. The seventh chapter of Romans is the New Testament
   counterpart of this book. Paul gives us in that chapter the experience
   of a redeemed soul, who knows what it is to delight in the law of God
   after the inward man, but who finds another law in his members warring
   against the law of his mind, and bringing him into continual captivity.
   It is too common an experience to need any description; for we all, I
   doubt not, know it for ourselves only too well, either in the past or
   the present. It is, in short, that experience in the church which has
   produced, and is best expressed by such hymns as the following:


   Look how we grovel here below,

   Fond of the earthly toys;

   Our souls, how heavily they go

   To reach eternal Joys!

   In vain we tune our formal songs,

   In vain we strive to rise;

   Hosannas languish on our tongues,

   And our devotion dies.

   That Christians could ever be willing to sing such experiences as
   these, seems a strange phenomenon. One would think, if it were
   unfortunately true, that it would be buried with shame in the deepest
   recesses of the heart, or spoken of only with the greatest sorrow. It
   is as though wives should put into verse, and sing to one another,
   their want of love and devotedness to their husbands. Or as though the
   children of Israel should have sung instead of weeping, when they found
   themselves turned back to wander in the wilderness.

   The wilderness wandering, however, does not fill up the whole book of
   Numbers. The first twelve chapters give us the details of God's
   provision for His people's need, as to service and warfare. And it is a
   provision so ample and complete, as to seem to leave no possible room
   for failure to come. As we read also concerning the Christian in Phil.
   iv. 19, My God shall supply all your need, according to His riches in
   glory by Christ Jesus. Neither they nor we can find any excuse for our
   failure in the insufficiency of His supplies.

   In chapters i. and ii. God numbers His people, and arranges them around
   His dwelling-place, assigning to each one his rightful position, and
   calling them by their names; a blessed illustration of the Good
   Shepherd's individual care of His flock, who calleth His own sheep by
   name and leadeth them out. The numbering here was especially for
   warfare, from twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go
   forth to war; and typifies the especial aspect of Christians, as
   engaged in spiritual conflicts with their enemies, the world, the
   flesh, and the devil. Only those who were able, were called into this
   warfare. The young, and weak and aged were to be spared; showing that
   only a vigorous Christian life can really fight the fight of faith. And
   all were to declare their pedigrees, i. 18, that it might be known
   beyond a shadow of doubt whether they really belonged to Israel. Souls
   who doubt whether they belong to God or not, can scarcely fight His
   battles, for their very doubts are a siding with the enemy against Him.

   In chapters iii. and iv. we have the Levites set apart for service:
   Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the
   priest, that they may minister unto him. And they shall keep his
   charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle
   of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle (iii. 6, 7).
   We may consider the Levites as a type of the church in service, doing
   the Lord's work, and having in charge His truth. The priest was a type
   of a soul in communion, and the Levite of the same soul in service. The
   Levites waited on the priests, and performed their service only at the
   appointment (iv. 19) of the priests. It is the soul in communion that
   finds out what the soul in service ought to do: and service is valuable
   only as it waits on, or ministers unto communion. The Levites carried
   the tabernacle, and its furniture, and its vessels in all the
   journeyings of the children of Israel, and set it up in every new
   encampment: a striking type of the fulfillment of Christ's command to
   His disciples, Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel. The
   service of each Levite was marked out for him by the commandment of
   the Lord, as we read concerning the service of the church in I Cor.
   xii. 11, But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
   dividing to every man severally as He will.

   In chapter v. we have provision made for the purity of the camp:
   Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every
   leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by
   the dead: both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall
   ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I
   dwell, v. 2, 3. God's presence requires perfect purity on the part of
   those among whom He dwells. He takes knowledge of every wrong, even of
   that which may be hidden from those nearest us, and brings it to
   judgment. This is very blessed to the soul that really loves holiness
   and hates sin. Knowing the deceitfulness of our own hearts, and how
   easily grave and serious defects may be hidden from us, and knowing, as
   we do, the grievous and sometimes fatal results that flow from our
   secret and often scarcely recognized faults, we may well rejoice that
   we have to do with a God who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity
   without recognizing it, and who is a discerner of the thoughts and
   intents of the heart.

   In chapter vi. we have given us God's mind respecting those whose
   hearts stir them up to a life of peculiar devotedness to the Lord,
   either for a particular work, or for an especial season:  When either
   man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to
   separate themselves unto the Lord, vi. 2. Such a one may be called for
   a time to deny himself from things not evil in themselves, and to which
   it may be he can one day return, (compare ver. 3 with ver. 20). But if
   the Lord has thus called us into separation for an especial purpose,
   either of service or of training, let us beware lest our separation be
   defiled by any lack of obedience to the divine command, or any want of
   watchfulness against the divine forbiddings. This separateness and this
   self-denial will bring us to a place of joyful communion when the days
   of our separation are fulfilled, and Christ in all His manifold
   fulness will be revealed to our souls, (see vi. 13-20). And the Lord
   can then pronounce over us without any hindrance His richest blessings,
   as He did upon Israel at the close of this chapter.


   The Lord bless thee and keep thee;

   The Lord make His face shine upon thee,

   and be gracious unto thee;

   The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee,

   and give thee peace!

   In chapter vii. we have the offerings of the princes of Israel. Willing
   offering is always the result of blessing. Freely ye have received,
   freely give, is always the Lord's way with us. These offerings are a
   type of the willing offerings of God's children now, who may be princes
   in giving, even though poor in this world's riches. And He notes it
   all; every bowl and every spoon, and even every cup of cold water given
   in the name of the Lord is written in His book of remembrance, and not
   one shall lose its reward.

   Chapter viii. gives us further details as to the Levitical service and
   the cleansing necessary for it, teaching us in type the absolute
   necessity for purity of heart, as the basis for any effectual and
   acceptable service to God.

   Chapter ix. gives us the provision for keeping the Passover in the
   wilderness, and for the guidance of the children of Israel in their
   journeys. The passover was the memorial of their redemption out of
   Egypt, and was to be kept by the people, even in the wilderness. A
   type, I think, of the continual remembrance on our part of the fact
   that we have been redeemed, even though we may know ourselves to be
   wandering in wilderness places. Neither defilement nor distance was to
   hinder from the keeping of the passover: Speak unto the children of
   Israel, saying, If any man of you or your posterity shall be unclean by
   reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep
   the passover unto the Lord, ix. 10. But it was to be kept in the
   second month, instead of the first, see ix. II, teaching that
   defilement hinders or delays assurance, although it does not deprive
   the soul of its right to it. A child may be naughty, but it will be
   still a child, and no parent would be pleased to have it begin to
   consider itself no longer a child.

   The presence of the pillar of cloud and fire guiding and protecting the
   children of Israel in all their journeys, (ix. 15-23), seems to me a
   very beautiful type of the presence of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of
   God's people, guiding them day by day in all the journey of life. And
   when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the
   children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode,
   there the children of Israel pitched their tents. At the commandment of
   the Lord the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of
   the Lord they pitched, ix. 17, 18. There were no roads nor guide-posts
   in that great and terrible wilderness, and none of whom they could
   inquire their way. Yet they journeyed without carefulness, because
   the Lord led them at every step. They had none of the care nor
   responsibility of the journey. They had no need to meet and consult as
   to the best paths to take, nor to send out scouts to choose their
   route. They had only to watch the pillar of fire and of cloud and
   follow its movements, and all was well. A beautiful picture of the
   believer's absolute dependence upon the blessed guidance of the Holy
   Spirit, and of what ought to be his complete subjection to it.

   And now that all had been arranged in God's order, the journey began.
   And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the
   second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the
   testimony. And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
   wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
   And they departed from the mount of the Lord three days' journey: and
   the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days'
   journey, to search out a resting place for them (x. 11, 12 and 33). It
   is thus that the Lord, when He putteth forth His own sheep goeth before
   them. And how little cause for fear or anxiety can there be in a
   journey so guided, by such a Leader.

   Yet almost at once the evil heart of unbelief showed itself, and the
   people complained (xi. I); and, seduced by the mixed multitude who
   accompanied them, they began to look back longingly to Egypt We
   remember, they said, the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
   cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the
   garlic: but now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all besides
   this manna, before our eyes  (xi. 5, 6) . The soul that begins by
   complaining, soon ends by something worse. It loses its relish for
   heavenly food, and looks back with longing to that which the world
   gives. And the end is sadly typified in the closing verses of our
   chapter, xi. 33, 34. He gave them their request; but sent leanness
   into their soul. Ps. cvi. 15.

   The spirit of criticism follows swift upon spiritual leanness, as we
   see in chapter xii.: And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because
   of the Ethiopian woman he had married. The soul filled with the love
   of Christ has lost the spirit of judging. The divine charity spread
   abroad in the heart thinketh no evil. But an inward want of union
   with Christ always leads the soul to climb up on the judgment seat, and
   to take upon itself the task of removing the mote out of its brother's
   eye, regardless of the beam in its own. God deals with all such,
   however, sooner or later, and sounds in the inmost ear the solemn
   question, Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
   servant Moses? And in mercy He reproves and chastens until the sin is
   acknowledged and the soul restored, 10-15.

   In chapter xiii. we enter upon one of the saddest epochs of the history
   of the children of Israel. They are here brought to the very borders of
   the land which the Lord had given them for an inheritance, and for the
   very purpose of possessing which He had brought them out of Egypt. In
   Ex. iii. 8 He had said, I am come down to deliver them out of the hand
   of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land unto --what?--the
   wilderness? No; unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with
   milk and honey. And now that they had reached the borders of this
   land, the word to them was, Behold the Lord thy God hath set the land
   before thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath
   said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. Deut. i. 21.

   But the previous rebellion had weakened the heart of the people, and
   when they heard from their spies of giants, and cities walled and
   very great, they were afraid and refused to go up. Whither should we
   go up? they said, our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying,
   The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and
   walled up to heaven: and more- over, we have seen the sons of the
   Anakims there, Deut. i. 28. In vain Caleb and Joshua stilled the
   people saying, Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well
   able to overcome it. The remaining ten spies persisted in declaring,
   We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than
   we. And the children of Israel were finally so incensed at the
   faithful report of Caleb and Joshua that they bade stone them with
   stones, xiv. 10.

   This whole scene is a picture, I think, of a stage of Christian
   experience, which is, alas! only too common. The soul, which has been
   translated out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's
   dear Son, is brought face to face with the wonderful promises and
   blessings of the gospel, and longs to go up and possess them. The
   glorious liberty and triumphs, for instance of the eighth chapter of
   Romans confront us, and we ask, Is it not cur privilege to enter into
   these things now? But we are met on every hand by spies, who tell us
   of the giants in our way, and of the difficulties that we shall not be
   able to overcome; and thus our brethren so discourage our hearts that
   we finally give up in despair, as Israel did, and turn back to wander
   in the wilderness of the seventh of Romans, afraid to take possession
   of the very land of promise which the Lord our God declares He has
   given us, and into which it was the very purpose of our redemption that
   we should be brought.

   I know what it is to have been discouraged in the early part of my
   Christian course by the story of these spies, and to have become in
   turn a spy myself, bringing up a bad report of the land. When I was
   first converted I never dreamed of anything but of taking possession,
   of course, of all the rich and glorious things which I saw promised in
   the Bible to believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. I had never been used
   to hearing Christians talk much about their spiritual experience, and I
   supposed in my simplicity that to be in the kingdom of Heaven meant
   really to be in a kingdom of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy
   Ghost. And when in the course of a few weeks the giants began to
   appear in my land, and I found myself surrounded and overcome by a
   people greater and taller than I was, I at once concluded this must
   be because I had not learned the whole gospel, and that it only needed
   for me to be taught something more in order to get the victory.

   I had found in the Lord Jesus a deliverer from the guilt of sin, but
   now I wanted to find in Him a deliverer from the power of sin, and I
   did not know how to set about it. I went therefore to a spy to find
   out. He was a beloved Christian teacher who had been many years in the
   way, and must know, I supposed, all about it. But never shall I forget
   my disappointment! After I had stated my case and told my need, saying
   that I knew it was because of my ignorance, and because I had not taken
   in the fulness of the gospel that I was in so sad a case, my friend
   said, Oh, no! You are all right. You cannot expect such a deliverance
   as you are seeking. We all of us are more or less under the power of
   sin all our lives, and we must not expect the early joy of our
   conversion to last for ever. The seventh of Romans is the experience of
   the Christian throughout his whole life. I thought my friend knew, and
   I received his report as final, and at once settled down to my
   condition as being inevitable, and therefore to be endured with the
   best grace I could; but my heart sank as I left the house, and, like
   the children of Israel, I could have lifted up my voice and cried, so
   great was my disappointment. And many a time in the years that followed
   would I recall with saddest longing the blessedness I had felt when
   first I knew the Lord.

   But, so ignorant was I of God's ways, that I in turn became a spy,
   bringing a bad report of the land to the Christians who came to me for
   counsel, telling them it was indeed a good land and a large, but adding
   the fatal nevertheless of unbelief, that the people who dwelt in the
   land were too strong for them, and the cities were walled and very
   great. Many a one did I thus turn back, causing them to wander with me
   in the wilderness for many years.

   I am sure I but relate the experience of others of my readers in thus
   giving my own. In prayer-meetings, in sermons, in private converse, and
   in books, this report of the spies is declared to us over and over;
   until at last if any faithful Caleb or Joshua, who have wholly
   followed the Lord, comes forward with the assertion that, We are well
   able to overcome, the church is ready, in a figurative sense, even to
   stone them with stones. And I think if we are, many of us, honest with
   ourselves, we shall be forced to confess that some of these stones have
   been at one time or another cast by our own hands. Let us thank God if
   we have learned better, and if now we also can say of the people of the
   land, they are bread for us; their defence is departed from them, and
   the Lord is with us; fear them not.

   The New Testament tells us that the cause of this sad failure of the
   Israelites was unbelief. So we see that they could not enter in
   because of unbelief, (see Heb. iii. 15-19, and iv. 1-10). It was not
   their own weakness nor the strength of their enemies that hindered
   their entrance. They were, it is true, grasshoppers, and their
   enemies were giants and it was indeed manifest that they were not
   able to overcome. But the Lord was able. And He it was who was to fight
   for them and to bring them in. They had recognized this when they sang
   that triumphant song in Ex. xv., just after they had crossed the Red
   Sea: The Lord is a man of war, they sang, the Lord is His Name.
   Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power; thy right hand, O
   Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. The people shall hear and be
   afraid: sorrow shall take hold upon the inhabitants of Palestina.
   Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm
   they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord,
   till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. Thou shalt bring
   them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the
   place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in.

   Their enemies were as great and they themselves: were as weak when this
   song was sung, as when the borders of the land were reached. But the
   people, fresh from the Red Sea victories, had no fear on account of
   this. The Lord was to do it all; and what mattered to the Lord, the
   giants' strength or the weakness of be children of Israel? It is
   nothing to Him to work with many or with few, and no giants or walled
   cities can successfully oppose Him. It was unbelief, therefore, and
   unbelief alone that prevented their going in. It may have sounded like
   humility to themselves to talk thus of their own weakness, and the
   strength of their enemies, but it was really unbelief. See Ps. cvi.
   24-27. And while to us also it may seem very humble to dwell on our own
   weakness, and the strength of sin, and to be thereby hindered from
   realizing the gospel's richest blessings, yet it is as really unbelief
   in our case as in theirs. For the Lord our God which goeth before us,
   He it is who is to fight for us, and is to bring us in, and plant us in
   the land of our inheritance, as actually as He was to do it for them.
   Without Him we can do nothing literally. With Him we can do all things,
   and depending on Him we are always more than conquerors  over every
   enemy. He hath blessed us, He declares, with all spiritual blessings
   in heavenly places in Christ, and it only remains for us by faith to
   go up and possess them. If we do not, it will not be because of our
   weakness or the strength of our enemies, but because of unbelief. It
   will be because we measure our enemies with ourselves, instead of
   measuring them with the Lord. We may be, and indeed are grasshoppers
   in their sight, but what are they in the sight of God? Truly by the
   greatness of His arm they shall all be as still as a stone, before
   the soul that dares to step out on His promises and trust all to Him.

   The consequence of this failure on the part of the children of Israel
   was a forty years' wandering in the wilderness. See Num. xiv. 33, 34.
   The Lord did not forsake them because of it, but went with them in all
   their journeys, and still protected and guided them with His presence.
   And they might perhaps have been tempted, because of this, to think
   they must after all be about right, or He would not favor them so. But
   His estimate of this wilderness wandering is to be found in this, that
   in speaking of it He called it the time of provocation, or the
   provocation  See Heb. iii. 8-15, Ps. xcv. 8, Ps. lxxviii. 40. The Lord
   does not forsake the soul that fails to enter into the possession of
   the fulness of His salvation. In all our wanderings He accompanies us,
   and we may have many precious seasons when He delivers us from our
   enemies, or supplies our needs. In fact in the sacrifice of the Red
   Heifer, in Num. xix., we see an especial provision made for the
   uncleannesses sure to be contracted in the wilderness journey;
   answering, I believe, to the declaration in I John ii. 1, where the
   apostle, after having told us that he has written these things unto us
   that we sin not, adds, And if any man sin we have an Advocate with the
   Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. It is not that He sanctions the
   sin by His forgiveness, any more than He sanctioned the wilderness
   journey by His presence. But, like a loving parent, if His children
   will wander, He must keep with them through it all.

   Other rebellions followed this failure to go in and possess the land.
   They broke God's rest, chap. xv. 32-36. They rebelled against Moses and
   Aaron, chap. xvi., and sought to assume to themselves the place which
   could only be received as the gift of God. They complained at having
   been brought into such an evil place, chap. xx., and chode with
   Moses because of it. And in chap. xxi. 4, 5 we read, And the soul of
   the people was much discouraged because of the way. And the people
   spake against God and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up
   out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? And thus brought upon
   themselves the scourge of the fiery serpents, xxi. 6-9. And finally, in
   chap. xxv., Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the
   Lord was kindled against Israel. Until the Divine comment on it all
   is, How oft did they provoke Him in the wilderness, and grieve Him in
   the desert, Ps. lxxviii. 40.

   Each sin was no doubt the occasion of fresh displays of grace, but no
   one surely would argue from this that because grace abounded therefore
   sin might also abound. Rather would we cry with Paul, God forbid! How
   shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein? I would refer
   my readers to the seventy-eighth Psalm for the Lord's thoughts about
   this whole wilderness wandering.

   And yet at the close of it, when the children of Israel took up their
   final encampment in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by
   Jericho, xxii. 1, we have those wonderful chapters concerning Balaam
   and Balak, xxii., xxiii., xxiv., where God's richest blessings are
   pronounced upon this very people, who had so often provoked and grieved
   Him; and where we even read these remarkable words, xxiii. 21: He hath
   not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath He seen perverseness in
   Israel: Lord his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among
   them. What can this mean but that He has so completely put all our
   sins behind His back, and cast them so utterly into the depths of the
   sea, that He remembers them no more forever?

   From this time the wilderness wandering was over. The camp was not
   removed from the plains of Moab until in the book of Joshua they
   crossed the Jordan into the promised 'land. In the remaining chapters
   of Numbers we have given to us the final arrangements that had to be
   made before this could be done.

   In chapter xxvi. God numbers the people afresh, as heirs ready to take
   possession of their inheritance.

   In chapter xxvii. a new leader is appointed in the place of Moses to
   lead them out and bring them in, that the congregation of the Lord be
   not as sheep without a shepherd.

   In chapters xxviii. and xxix. we have details as to worship and
   sacrifices.

   Chapter xxx. is concerning the vows of women, showing us God's
   provision for folly and weakness, that those who are not responsible
   (as women were not among them) may have their foolish plans set aside
   by Christ, the heavenly Bridegroom.

   Chapter xxxi. gives us the story of a war which resulted from the sin
   of chap. xxv. The conflicts in the wilderness experience are not like
   the conflicts in the land of promise where actual spiritual ground is
   acquired as the result. They are always the result of sin, and are
   fruitless in results. as far as the acquisition of territory is
   concerned, although no conflict can be without immediate fruit in
   present spoils from the enemy.

   In chapter xxxi. we have the account of the children of Reuben and the
   children of Gad who took up their abode on the wilderness side of
   Jordan. They had a very great multitude of cattle, and behold, the
   place was a place for cattle. Therefore they said to Moses, Bring us
   not over Jordan. And many Christians are likewise tempted to take up
   their abode this side of Jordan; by the multitude of their cattle and
   because the place is a place for cattle. But such dwellers in the
   border-land are the first to fall a prey to the enemy, and are
   continually harassed by his attacks.

   Chapter xxxiii. reviews the way by which they had come, and commands
   the utter destruction of all the enemies in the land of their
   inheritance.

   Chapter xxxiv. marks the limits of the country they were to possess.

   Chapter xxxv. appoints the portion of the Levites, and the cities of
   refuge; the last being wonderful types of Christ as the Refuge of
   sinners.

   Chapter xxxvi. taken in connection with the first part of chap. xxvii.
   shows us the blessedness of a bold claim of faith, when regulated by
   the divine limitations. These daughters of Zelophehad would not forego
   the privileges which belonged. to them by inheritance, although to the
   eye of man they had no rightful claim. But this boldness of faith must
   be limited by the commandments of the Lord. See xxxvi. 1-12.

   The book closes with the children of Israel still encamped in the
   plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho, waiting for the rehearsing of
   the law which was to precede their final entrance into the promised
   land. This rehearsal we have given to us in Deuteronomy.

   The practical lesson taught us in the story contained in this book of
   Numbers is summarized in Heb. iv. 1, 2: Let us, therefore, fear. lest,
   a promise being left us of entering into His rest, any of you should
   seem to come short of it. For unto us was the Gospel preached, as well
   as unto them; but the word preached did not profit them, not being
   mixed with faith in them that heard it. A wonderful land of promise
   is opened out before every believer, and we are commanded to go in and
   possess it. But except this good news is mixed with faith in those
   who hear it, it will be of no avail, and they will find themselves
   among the number who could not enter in because of unbelief. The
   great thing necessary therefore is that we should believe. But believe
   what, some may ask? Believe that the land is ours, that the Lord is
   able to bring us in and give us our inheritance there, and that not an
   enemy shall be able to stand before us all the days of our life. And
   then, believing this, we shall have the courage of faith to apprehend
   that for which also we are apprehended of Christ Jesus, and shall
   realize that we which have believed do, even now and here, enter into
   rest.

CHAPTER VII.

DEUTERONOMY.

  CONSECRATION.

  Keynote: Rom. xii. 1, 2.

   THE book of Deuteronomy is a book of consecration. It shows us God's
   redeemed people standing a second time on the borders of the land of
   promise, and consecrating themselves afresh to Him, as a preparation
   for going in and possessing it. Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto
   the statutes and unto the judgments which I teach you, for to do them,
   that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of
   your fathers giveth you, iv.1.

   It is the consecration of a redeemed people that is prefigured here. It
   is not the surrender which the sinner is required to make before he can
   know the forgiveness of his sins; but it is the surrender required from
   the Christian, who already knows this, and who is seeking to enter into
   the full possession of the gifts and privileges of the Christian life.
   It answers to Rom. xii. 1 : I beseech you, therefore, brethren, by the
   mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
   acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not
   conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your
   mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect
   will of God.

   No such scene as this took place when the Israelites stood on the
   border of the Red Sea. The only point then was deliverance out of Egypt
   in the quickest way possible. And the surrender called for was only
   that they should consent to turn their backs on Egypt with its fish,
   and cucumbers, and melons, and leeks, and onions, and garlic, and
   should follow the Lord their God as He led them out into a land they
   knew not. Repent and believe the Gospel, turn your backs on the old
   life of sin and begin the new life of faith, is the New Testament
   expression of this stage in their experience.

   As long as the Israelites were in Egypt they could not keep God's law,
   because they were Pharaoh's slaves; and they had to be delivered in
   order that they might be able to keep it. But being delivered, and
   having been made God's people, they were then ready to hear the law and
   to consecrate themselves to obey it. And with us likewise, the first
   step in our experience must be, deliverance out of Satan's kingdom, and
   the new birth into the kingdom of God's dear Son; for the carnal mind,
   we are told, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.
   The consecration, therefore, which is set before us in this book, can
   never precede the new birth, but must always follow it.

   And, in fact, as a general thing, many points exercise our hearts
   before we come to this consecration, -- how to be safe from the
   destroying angel; how to be delivered out of Egypt; how to have access
   to God; how to be led through the wilderness; how to overcome the
   enemies there. Until at last we come in our experience, as Israel did,
   a second time to the borders of the land of promise, and our souls
   begin to long to know something of the power of Christ's resurrection,
   and to live, even now and here, in heavenly places. And at this point
   the need for consecration presents itself before us. We realize that
   unless we are in very truth wholly the Lord's, He cannot lead us into
   the land of our inheritance. Not that there has been no consecration of
   ourselves previously. There may have been one or many; there must be,
   in fact, a measure of consecration in the heart of every believer in
   the Lord Jesus Christ. The law had been given to Israel just after
   their deliverance out of Egypt, and they had promised to obey it (see
   Ex. xix. 5-8). But now that they were about to enter Canaan, it was
   necessary that a deeper consecration should be made, which should have
   especial reference to their conduct in the land, and the conditions of
   their relationship with the Lord there. These are the statutes and
   judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the Lord God
   of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live
   upon the earth, xii. 1. And however it may have been as regards former
   consecrations in our own experience, I am sure we shall find that, when
   we seek to enter into the land of promise, a renewed surrender will
   be necessary, and that it must be of a far deeper and more
   heart-searching character than any former one has ever been.

   It is necessary to keep all this clearly in mind in order to understand
   the conditional character of the book of Deuteronomy. We meet here
   continually with the word if, All these blessings shall come upon
   thee and overtake thee, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the
   Lord thy God, xxviii. 2. But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not
   hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all His
   commandments that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake
   thee, xxviii. 15. The blessings of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
   are so unconditional, and His gifts are so free, that we are apt to
   think there are no ifs to be found in it any where, and that the
   introduction of any conditions are always a mistake of legality. But
   while it is true that forgiveness is a free gift, bestowed without
   money and without price upon all who need it and will take it, it is
   also equally true that holiness of heart is a gift with conditions. No
   sick man can be healed by a physician, be he ever so skilful, unless he
   will submit himself to that physician's prescriptions and obey his
   orders. And no soul can be cured of the dreadful malady of sin, until
   it is willing to surrender every sin, and submit itself to the Lord's
   commands against it. Conditions do necessarily come in here. Obedience
   to law has its inevitable blessings, and disobedience its inevitable
   curses. And the consecration set forth in Deuteronomy is no legal
   demand of so much surrender for so much blessing, but is simply the
   necessary state in which blessing can be bestowed. And it remains to be
   as true now as it was then, that, if thou shalt keep the commandments
   of the Lord thy God, and walk in His ways, the Lord shall establish
   thee an holy people unto Himself as He hath sworn unto thee, xxviii.
   9. But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice
   of the Lord thy God to observe to do all His commandments, that the
   Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation and rebuke in all that thou
   settest thine hand unto for to do, and thou shalt grope at noonday as
   the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways:
   and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall
   save thee, xxviii. 29.

   Consecration is therefore, if we only understood it, not a sacrifice
   demanded, but a privilege bestowed. It is the only pathway there is to
   the unspeakable and inestimable blessings promised to the believer; and
   the Lord who calls us into this pathway knows that He is calling us to
   something that will make for us almost a Heaven upon earth. I speak
   strongly, but none too much so I am sure. To be wholly the Lord's, does
   bring to the soul spiritual blessings that answer, step by step, to the
   temporal blessings which followed obedience with the children of
   Israel. Read the book of Deuteronomy with this thought in mind, and see
   how wonderful are we similitudes. First of all the land into which
   obedience was to bring them: For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a
   good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that
   spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and
   vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;
   a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not
   lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose
   hills thou mayest dig brass, viii. 7-9. And again, the Lord thy God
   will give thee great and goodly which thou buildest not, and houses
   full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged,
   which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou
   plantedst not, vi. 10, 11.

   How exactly these descriptions answer to those rich spiritual
   possessions, and that blessed land of spiritual rest and joy, into
   which the obedient soul enters now.

   Take also the blessings that follow and overtake the obedient in vii.
   12-16 and xxviii. 1-13: The Lord shall command the blessing upon thee
   in thy storehouses, and in all that thou settest thy hand unto.
   Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be
   when thou goest out. Thy enemies shall be conquered, vii. 16; thy
   diseases shall be healed, vii. 15; thou shalt have riches in abundance
   to bestow on all who need, xxviii. 11, 12; the Lord shall love thee
   with a peculiar love, vii. 13; and shall fulfil His promises to thee,
   vii. 12; and finally, and best of all, He shall establish thee an holy
   people unto Himself as He hath sworn unto thee, if only thou wilt keep
   the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in His ways, xviii. 9.

   Take on the other hand the curses which it is declared in xxviii. 15-68
   will surely come upon and overtake those who will not hearken unto
   the voice of the Lord; and notice the marvellous similitude there is
   between them, and the spiritual loss and suffering which we all .know
   invariably comes upon and overtakes the disobedient soul now. When such
   spray, the heaven seems to have become as brass, xxviii. 23; their
   spiritual enemies smite them and cause them to flee, v. 25; spiritual
   diseases of all kinds prostrate and afflict them, and even the old
   diseases of Egypt from which they had hoped to have been delivered,
   return upon them, and the old temptations of their unconverted days
   again overcome them, verses 27, 60; spiritual blindness overtakes them,
   and they grope at noonday and cannot find their way, verses 28, 29;
   their strength fails, v. 32; their work is fruitless, and they have no
   stores to give to others who are in need, verses 38-44; and, in short,
   the Lord's word to such a one is the same as to disobedient Israel of
   old, that thou salt find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot
   have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a trembling heart, and
   failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind; and thy life shall hang in doubt
   before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none
   assurance of thy life.

   But that this consecration was not to be looked upon as a painful
   demand; can be seen from the continual exhortations to rejoice
   throughout this book, see xii. 7, xiv. 26, xvi. 14, 15, xxii. 11, and
   from the word of warning in xxviii. 47, 48, Because thou servedst not
   the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the
   abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies,
   which the Lord shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and
   in nakedness, and in want of all things: and He shall put a yoke of
   iron upon thy neck, until He have destroyed thee.

   Faber says,--


   God's will on earth is always joy,

   Always tranquility.

   And the soul that has learned to know God can say, Amen, to this with
   eager gladness. For the will of God is the will of love, and the will
   of love can never be anything but richest blessing to the loved one. We
   all know this, even in our poor meagre human experience of love. We
   know that where we love, our will towards the object of our affections
   embraces and demands only their blessing and their happiness. Our own
   happiness is as nothing in comparison, and our only trouble is that we
   cannot find ways enough in which to express and pour out our love. We
   know that the one question of our hearts is not, What can they do for
   me? but, What can I do for them? Their good is our good, their
   sufferings are ours, and every joy that lights up their faces lights
   ours as well. Would they submit themselves utterly to our will, and let
   us have our way with them in all things, how infinitely happy we would
   make them if we could, along what smooth pathways we would lead them,
   and how tenderly we would guard them from danger or pain. And if this
   is true of our paltry human love, what must it be with the infinite,
   unspeakable and unknowable love of God? If therefore, we have ever been
   able to trust ourselves gladly to an earthly lover, or to surrender our
   wills to the call of human affection, surely we might with a fearless
   devotion abandon ourselves to the dear disposal of our Lord and Saviour
   and might say to Him with the gladdest joy, Thy will be done, Thy will
   be done, Thy will be done on earth as it is done in Heaven.

   I confess that to me these words are among the sweetest ever put into
   mortal lips-- Thy will be done on earth as it is done in Heaven. It
   is the perfect doing of God's will that makes Heaven what it is, and to
   have His will done perfectly here would turn this earth into a Heaven
   also. And in so far as it is done in any individual life or by any
   individual heart it does bring Heaven down into that heart and life,
   and makes that man dwell in a perpetual kingdom. For he does indeed
   always reign who sides with God, since God's way is his way, and
   God's will is his.

   Alas! how grievous it is that any one should ever have a different
   thought from this. And yet we all know how common it is, even for
   Christians, to look upon consecration as a stern demand, and to shrink
   from the will of God as from the worst evil that could befall them. I
   knew of a Christian teacher once who was asked by one of his friends to
   speak on the subject of consecration. Oh do not ask me to do that,
   was his shuddering reply! Do you know what consecration means? he
   continued. It means that all that is bright and pleasant in your life
   will be taken out of it, and that every hard and sad thing you can
   conceive of will come into it. It means that you will have to do
   impossible things, and that your ease and comfort will be gone
   forever. How little could such a soul have known about the Lord whom
   he was trying to serve! Sometimes children misjudge their parents in
   this way, and expect from them only harshness and stern demands. But
   where such is the case, it argues, either a very cruel parent, or a
   very naughty child, and the universal instincts of the human heart
   condemn it. How is it then that we can so calmly misunderstand and
   misjudge our Lord, whose will can be nothing but goodness and love,
   since He Himself is these and these only?

   Oh, dear friends, if this has been the thought of any one of you, if
   your heart has been afraid of your Father's will, and has hesitated to
   consent to it, confess your sin now with shame and sorrow, and begin
   from this time forward to say to Him a continual, Yes, throughout all
   the range of your being.


   *Thy wonderful grand will, my God,

   With triumph now I make it mine,

   And faith shall cry a joyful, Yes!

   To every dear command of Thine.

   The book of Deuteronomy may be divided into three parts. The first
   eleven chapters contain mostly exhortations to obedience, with the
   motives of love and gratitude that should urge to it. Moses here
   beseeches the people, as Paul did the Romans, by the mercies of God,
   to present themselves a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God,
   which he proves is but their reasonable service. He begins with a
   narrative of their past experiences, chaps. i., ii., iii., and on the
   ground of the Lord's gracious dealing with them and their own
   unfaithfulness, he urges them in chap. iv. to take heed to themselves
   and keep their souls diligently, lest, he says, thou forget the
   things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart
   all the days of thy life; but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons,
   v. 9. In chaps. v. and vi. he reminds them of the ten commandments, and
   shows them that they are still binding, and still full of infinite
   blessing. Ye shall walk in all to ways which the Lord your God hath
   commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and
   that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess, v.
   33. In chaps. vii.-xi. he reiterates over and over, in the most
   touching language, God's love and care for them, declaring to them how
   He had chosen them to be a special people unto Himself above all the
   people that are upon the face of the earth," vii. 6. And showing them
   that this was not because of their own greatness or goodness, but
   because the Lord loved them, and because He "would keep the oath which
   He had sworn," vii. 7, 8. He exhorts them to "remember all the way" by
   which the Lord had led them, viii. 2, and sets before them the
   blessings to which He was bringing them, viii. 7-9.

   In chapters xii. to xxix. are given the new commandments which were
   made necessary by the new position they were about to occupy as God's
   peculiar people, dwelling in a land of enemies. These had especial
   reference to their worship, chapters xii., xvi., xvii., xxvi.; their
   utter separation from all evil, either of idols, chap. xiii.; or of
   unclean food, chap. xiv.; or of moral sin, chaps. xxi., xxii.; or of
   natural defilement, chap. xxiii.; and their dealings in love and grace
   with one another, chaps. xv., xxiv., xxv. Chap. xxviii. sets before
   them the blessings that follow obedience, and the curses that follow
   disobedience. Chapter xxix. is the personal application to the
   consciences of the people of all that has preceded. Chapters xxx. and
   xxxi. are prophetic of their backsliding, and contain a blessed message
   of God's restoring love. Chapter xxxii. is Moses' song, which was to be
   taught to the children of Israel, to be in their remembrances as a
   continual witness against them when the days of their failure should
   come, see xxxi. 19- 22. Chapter xxxiii. contains the revelation of the
   wondrous blessings the Lord had still for His people, although He knew
   their weakness and their foolishness, and fore- saw their wanderings;
   blessings sure to come at last, though they may have to tarry long
   because of the hardness of their hearts. "Happy art thou, O Israel; who
   is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help,
   and who is the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall be
   found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places,"
   xxxiii. 29.

   Chapter xxxiv. gives us the death of Moses, preceded by his view into
   the promised land from Pisgah's height; and closes with God's testimony
   concerning him, that "there arose not a prophet since in Israel like
   unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face."

   That Moses could not enter the promised land seems to me significant of
   the fact that the law can have nothing to do with the soul that is
   "seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus." Moses was in a very
   especial way the representative of the law, as we are told "the law was
   given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," John i. 17.
   And to make the picture complete, we may well believe that Moses must
   die before Joshua could lead the people in. The very opening of the
   book of Joshua implies this, for we read there that the Lord spake unto
   Joshua, saying, "Moses my servant is dead: now therefore arise, go over
   this Jordan, thou and all this people, unto the land which I do give to
   them."

   It may seem strange to insist upon a perfect obedience to the law, and
   then to talk about the law being dead. But it is a fact in experience
   that complete surrender to any law, always makes the soul free from
   that law. The law-abiding citizen who has no thought of breaking the
   laws of his country, is as free from those laws as though there were
   none. The law is dead as far as he is concerned, because it demands
   only that which he himself thinks is best and right, and which
   therefore he wants to give; and for him in effect here is no law. But
   he is made free by obeying the law, not by disobeying it. And so also
   it is said of the Christian who has submitted himself fully to the law
   of God and who walks in the Spirit, "that against such there is no
   law," Gal. v. 23. If the law is written in our hearts, we shall not
   need it in outward code; and we shall "walk at liberty" as the Psalmist
   says, just because we seek God's precepts, and keep His law
   continually, Ps. cxix. 44, 45.

   In chap. xxvi. we have given us what might be called the process of
   consecration. The believer comes here before the Lord bringing the
   first-fruits of his land as a free will offering, and confessing his
   standing and his possessions, "I profess this day unto the Lord try
   God, that I am come unto the country which the Lord sware unto our
   fathers for to give us." See also verses 5-10. No doubts are here. "I
   am come;" "He hath brought;" "He hath given." Doubts are fatal to
   consecration. The soul must be assured that it belongs to the Lord,
   before it can consecrate itself to His service. But being thus assured,
   and acknowledging it, the path is simple, and is clearly laid down in
   verses 16-19. In verse 16 we have the command. In verse 17 the
   surrender to obedience. And in verses 18, 19 the Lord's acceptance. We
   avouch the Lord to be our God, and that we will walk in His ways and
   keep His commandments; and He at once avouches us to be His peculiar
   people, and declares that we shall keep His commandments, and that He
   will make is an holy people. Our part is to surrender ourselves to Him,
   and His part is to accomplish the work.

   To pass through the experience of Deuteronomy therefore, brings the
   soul out into a large place, into a land of liberty and rest, and joy.
   and blessings innumerable; and I would entreat every one of my readers,
   before turning to another chapter of this book, to surrender
   themselves, gladly and unconditionally to the sweet will of God, to be
   its captive forever!


   "Thy beautiful sweet will, my God,

   Holds fast in its sublime embrace

   My captive will, a gladsome bird

   Prisoned in such a realm of grace.

   O lightest burden, sweetest yoke,

   It lifts, it bears my happy soul;

   It giveth wings to this poor heart

   My freedom is Thy grand control.

   Upon God's will I lay me down

   As child upon its mother's breast,

   No silken couch, nor softest bed

   Could ever give me such sweet rest."

   It may be that you have not hitherto looked upon God's will in this
   light, and have shrunk from abandoning yourselves to its control. What
   words can I use, dear friends, to make you see that it is the one only
   desirable thing in earth or Heaven; and that to be all the Lord's, and
   entirely at His dear disposal is Heaven begun below? No human words can
   tell this story, for it hath not entered into the heart of man to
   conceive the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. But
   to every surrendered soul He will reveal them by His Spirit, and you
   shall know the fulfilment of that wondrous promise of our Lord's, "He
   that hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me;
   and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him,
   and manifest myself to him. * * * If a man love me he will keep my
   words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make
   our abode with him," John xiv. 21-23.

   Joseph Cook in one of his scientific statements concerning conscience
   says, "It is fact of experience that whenever we submit utterly,
   affectionately, irreversibly to the best we know, that is to the
   Innermost Holiest of conscience, at that instant, and never before,
   there flashes through us with quick, splendid, interior, unexpected
   illumination, a Power and a Presence not ourselves; and we know by the
   inner light that God is with us in a sense utterly unknown before."

   Surely for such an end as this any surrender could be nothing but joy.
   Try it, dear reader, and see if all I say is not true and infinitely
   more that I cannot say. And thus going step by step with the children
   of Israel through the book of Deuteronomy, let us be prepared in Joshua
   with them to cross the Jordan and go in and take possession of the
   promised land.

CHAPTER VIII.

JOSHUA.

  THE REDEEMED IN HEAVENLY PLACES.

  Keynote: Rom. viii. 1-4.

   THE book of Joshua gives us the redeemed in heavenly places. It is the
   story of the entrance of God's chosen people into the land of their
   possession, and their victories and rest there. It answers to the book
   of Ephesians, where we are shown the believer as "blessed with all
   spiritual blessings in heavenly places," made to "sit together in
   heavenly places in Christ Jesus," and wrestling there against spiritual
   wickedness, or as the margin has it "against wicked spirits in heavenly
   places." Eph. i. 3; ii. 6; vi. 12.

   God's redeemed people in this book come out of the wilderness, and
   enter at last into possession of the land which He had promised them,
   the land from which they had been turned back forty years before by
   their unbelief. They conquer the very cities, great and walled up to
   heaven, which had frightened them so then, and overcome the giants of
   whom they had said, "We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so
   we were in their sight." In this book the Christian, in type, comes out
   of the wilderness of the seventh chapter of Romans, where his language
   is, "Oh wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of
   this death," into the promised land of the eighth chapter, where he can
   triumphantly exclaim, "Nay, in all these things we are more than
   conquerors through Him that loved us."

   The land of Canaan is often taken as being intended for a type of
   heaven, and crossing the Jordan as a type of death. But this can hardly
   be, since in heaven we shall have no foes to conquer, and there will be
   no danger of failure there, while in Canaan there were enemies on every
   hand, and many instances of grievous defeat. In Hebrews iii. and iv.
   the Holy Ghost takes up the story of Israel's failure to enter into the
   land of Canaan, and applies it to the consciences of Christians, as a
   warning to them not to make a similar failure. "Let us therefore fear,"
   he says, "lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any
   of you should seem to come short of it. For unto us was the gospel
   preached as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit
   them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. For we which
   have believed do enter into rest." This rest is plainly a present
   possession of the trusting soul; something that can be enjoyed in this
   life; for we are told that those who believe do now and here "enter
   into rest." And I think therefore that we must look upon the land of
   promise then, as a type of the land of promise now, and the victories
   and rest there, as pictures of the victories and rest the soul finds in
   the present day, when it has fully taken possession of God's promises,
   and is dwelling in the enjoyment of them.

   I was once taught a very striking lesson on this point by a dear old
   colored saint, who was attending a Bible class of which I was the
   teacher. The portion of Scripture we were considering was the book of
   Romans, and I was expounding especially the seventh and eighth
   chapters. I thought the dear old sister seemed rather puzzled by my
   explanations, but put this down to her want of intelligence, when
   suddenly she burst out with, "Why, honey, it 'pears like you don't
   understand dem chapters. You talk just as if you thought we was to live
   all de time in de seventh of Romans, and only pay little visits now and
   then to de eighth." "Certainly," I replied, "that is just what I do
   think, do not you?" "Oh honey," she said with infinite pity and
   surprise in her tone, "I'se afeard you don't know much. Why I lives in
   de eighth!" And the old face shone through all its blackness with what
   Joseph Cook calls the "solar light," as she said the words, and I felt
   they were true; but I was actually so ignorant as to think that it must
   be because she was colored and poor, that God had given her such
   peculiar blessings, in order to make up to her for these misfortunes!
   And I almost wished I too was colored and poor, that I might have a
   chance for similar blessing! But I could never forget the impression
   made upon me, and from that time onward sought continually for the
   secret of her joy. Until at last the path across from the seventh to
   the eighth of Romans was revealed to me, and I saw that people who were
   not old, nor poor, nor colored, might yet also take up their abode in
   the blessed land of promise there revealed.

   The book of Joshua opens on the children of Israel encamped in the
   plains of Moab "on this side Jordan, in the wilderness." Their long
   weary wanderings, since they had refused to enter the land forty years
   before, had not brought them any nearer Canaan than they were when they
   set out. They were on the borders then, and they were only on the
   borders now. They had been moving, certainly, during all these forty
   years, but like a great deal of what is called "religious growth,"
   their course had not been "upward and onward." They had gone round and
   round in that dreary wilderness, doubling on their track continually,
   and journeying onward, only to journey back again. And now a river lay
   between them and the land of their possession. Had they gone in at
   first, at Kadesh-barnea, they would have had only an unseen boundary to
   cross, and the transition would not have been so strongly marked. And
   so I believe that in the experience of the Christian, there need not be
   that definite step, to which so many object, in entering into the more
   full enjoyment of the promises of the gospel, if only at our conversion
   we were taught that we were well able to overcome the land, and were
   urged to go in at once and possess it. Doubtless some do thus enter in
   at Kadesh-barnea. But the majority of Christians, like the Israelites,
   fail to enter in at first, because of unbelief, and are turned back
   like them to wander in the wilderness of the seventh of Romans.

   But there comes a time to all such, sooner or later, I believe, when
   they are brought a second time to the borders of the land; and to them
   this book is full of most blessed teaching.

   It opens with the Lord's command to His people. "Now therefore, arise,
   go over this Jordan, thou and all this people, unto the land which I do
   give to them." (i. 2.) It was not only a privilege He offered them, but
   a command He made. His object in redeeming them out of Egypt had been
   to bring them into this land. "I am come down," He said in Exodus, "to
   deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out
   of that land unto," --what? the wilderness, to wander there forty
   years? --no, -- "unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with
   milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and
   the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites."
   And unless they should actually be brought into this land, the nations
   round about, who knew of their going out of Egypt, and who had heard
   that the Lord was among them and "was seen face to face," and that He
   went "before them, by day time in a pillar of cloud, and in a pillar of
   fire by night," might well say, as Moses feared they would, that it was
   "because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which
   He sware unto them. "Numbers xiv. 14-16. Therefore, for His own glory's
   sake, it was necessary that His people should go in and be planted in
   the land of their inheritance. And with us also it is not a privilege
   only, but the commandment of our Lord, that we shall enter into
   possession of the promises, into that land of blessing and of rest
   which corresponds spiritually to the Canaan of the Israelites. "Abide
   in me." "Be filled with the Spirit." "Reckon yourselves to be dead
   indeed unto sin." "Be careful for nothing." "Let not your heart be
   troubled, neither let it be afraid." All these are glorious privileges,
   but they are positive commands also. And unless Christians do as a fact
   enter into this blessed fullness of their salvation, they will surely
   give occasion to the world to say; that it is because God is not able
   to bring them into the land which He sware unto them. For as we read in
   Luke i. 69-75, the declaration concerning the Lord Jesus by the Holy
   Ghost was, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
   redeemed His people, and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us, in
   the house of his servant David: As he spake by the mouth of his holy
   prophets, which have been since the world began: that we should be
   saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us; to
   perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember His holy
   covenant; the oath which He sware to our father Abraham, that He would
   grant unto us, that we, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies,
   might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him,
   all the days of our life." If we then as Christians, say this is
   impossible, we in effect declare that what God has promised He is not
   able to perform; and thus bring dishonor on His great name.

   It is the Lord's command to us, therefore, that we go in and possess
   the land of our inheritance. And to me God's commands are even more
   comforting than His promises; for if He commands me to do a thing, I am
   sure He will give me the power of His Spirit to do it. His commands are
   not grievous, we are told, but surely they would be grievous, if we
   were utterly unable to obey them. It would have been a grievous thing
   indeed had He commanded the children of Israel to go in and possess the
   land of Canaan, and yet, knowing that they were utterly unable to do
   it, had not Himself intended to supply them with the power. And, in
   fact, He uses His very command as the reason why they should have no
   fear. "Have not I commanded thee?" He asks. "Be strong and of a good
   courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God
   is with thee whithersoever thou goest," i. 9. As much as to say, "Thou
   needst have no fear in undertaking to do what I have commanded thee to
   do, for I am in every command I give, and will always bestow the
   necessary power to obey it."

   Another thing is to be noticed in this opening proclamation of the Lord
   to His people. "Every place that the soles of your feet shall tread
   upon that have I given unto you," i. 3. Not "that will I give," but of
   "that have I given." It was all theirs in the purpose and mind of God,
   but unless they actually went there and set their feet upon it, it did
   not become theirs practically and experimentally. This is necessarily
   true of any gift. The giver may give it with all the sincerity and
   good-will possible, but unless the one to whom he gives it, actually
   receives it, and appropriates it, and calls it his own, it never comes
   really into his possession at all. Even though a gift should be laid on
   the table, or put in the pocket of a friend, unless that friend closes
   the hand of acceptance over it, and says mentally, "It is mine," he
   will not after all possess it.

   The children of Israel were going in to take possession of their own
   land. The Lord had given it to them centuries before, and it was theirs
   all the while, only waiting for their coming. And so of ourselves we
   read that God "hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
   places in Christ," although we very well know that until the hand of
   faith really closes over and appropriates these blessings, and we begin
   to say "they are mine," we do not actually and experimentally come into
   their enjoyment at all.

   This land of promise seems to me to typify, as I have said, that
   experience in the Christian life which is called variously
   sanctification, perfect love, the rest of faith, the interior life,
   full salvation, the higher Christian life, and many other names, which
   all however I believe mean one and the same thing. And what they mean
   is according to my understanding of it, that at some certain time in
   its experience the soul finds in the Lord Jesus Christ not only a
   deliverer from the guilt of sin, but also a deliverer from its power;
   and comes into a life of victory, and rest, and liberty, and peace. and
   joy in the Holy Ghost. The Christian who has entered into this
   experience finds himself in possession of the promises at which he has
   hitherto looked with longing but hopeless eyes. His will is in harmony
   with God's will. Obedience becomes a delight, and service sweet. Cares,
   and fears, and anxieties are all lost in the infiniteness of God's
   love. And the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus is found
   experimentally to set the soul free from the law of sin and death.
   Romans vi. and viii. are perhaps the best expressions of this life;
   though the whole New Testament is one long declaration and description
   of it.

   The way into it is like the way out of the wilderness into the promised
   land. It is by the pathway of consecration and faith. Entire surrender
   to the will of God and perfect trust in His love, will take thee there
   dear seeker, whether thou clearly understandest the doctrines
   concerning it or not; and once in, thou wilt know more about it, than I
   could tell thee if I should write a book full concerning it. Let me
   earnestly beg of thee, therefore, to be strong and of a good courage,
   for has not the Lord commanded thee? Arise then, this very day, and,
   with Israel, go in to possess the land which the Lord thy God giveth
   thee, to possess it. Step the foot of thy faith upon each one of His
   promises, and stand there steadfastly, sure that they shall be every
   one thine. Thy part is to step, His it is to give thee possession. And
   His blessed Spirit, who abides in every promise, will make thee mighty
   through God to the pulling down of every stronghold, and the overcoming
   of every enemy.

   In chapter second we have given us the history of Rahab, a wonderful
   picture of how acceptable faith is to the Lord, even when exercised in
   the midst of great ignorance and distance from Himself. The comment of
   the Holy Ghost is given us in Heb. xi. 31: "By faith the harlot Rahab
   perished not with them that believed not." And her faith so
   strengthened the faith of the spies that they returned to Joshua with
   the triumphant language, "Truly the Lord hath delivered into our hands
   all the land: for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint
   because of us," ii. 24. How different the report of these spies from
   that of the spies sent out forty years before. The giants were as
   mighty now as then, and the cities as great, and they themselves were
   as weak. But then they had left out the Lord, and had measured their
   enemies with themselves; and now Rahab had brought Him in for she had
   said, "I know that THE LORD hath given you the land," ii. 9. When God
   is brought into the scene and our enemies are measured with Him, there
   can no longer be any doubt or fear remaining. And I believe, dear
   reader, that if we could send out spies into the land of our
   possession, as Israel did, we would find also, that our enemy faints
   because of us, and that he knows, whether we do or not, that the Lord
   hath delivered into our hands all the land. He is an already conquered
   foe, and the courage of faith will soon discover this, let him bluster
   as he may.

   In chapter third we have the wonderful scene of the crossing of
   Jordan,-- a crossing which, while in many respects it is similar to,
   was yet very different from the crossing of the Red Sea. At the Red Sea
   no preparation was needed to make them ready, but they crossed in haste
   to escape from a pursuing enemy. Here the command was, "Prepare you
   victuals, for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan to go in
   to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it,"
   i. 11. And again we read in iii. 5 that Joshua said unto the people,
   "Sanctify yourselves; for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among
   you." There was no pursuing enemy now behind them, but instead, a
   glorious land lay before them, and a preparation was necessary before
   they could enter it. This preparation was one of consecration. The word
   sanctify means set apart, separate yourselves from all evil. It means
   just what Paul says in 2 Cor. vii. 1. "Having therefore these promises,
   dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the
   flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." all that
   consciously defiles must be laid aside, before the soul can expect to
   enter into the fulness of God's promises.

   Again, at the Red Sea the path was made, before the Israelites were
   called upon to take a single step. But here the path was only made when
   they stepped. "And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the
   feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the
   earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan
   shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they
   shall stand upon an heap." Joshua iii. 13. The priests who are types of
   Christians in communion with God, were to step into the brimming river,
   for at this time Jordan was overflowing all its banks; and as they thus
   stepped in, the waters stood and rose up on an heap and the path was
   made. iii. 15-17. And so in realizing the forgiveness of our sins, we
   believe in an already accomplished fact, and enter into the enjoyment
   of a finished work. While in sanctification we believe in a fact that
   is accomplished when we believe, and enter into the enjoyment of a work
   that is going on as we trust.

   It required a far stronger faith to cross the Jordan than to cross the
   Red Sea; and the faith which can trust for the forgiveness of sins,
   needs to be greatly strengthened, in order to believe in victory over
   sin. To my, this stepping into a brimming river, when as yet there was
   no sign of a path, is one of the grandest pictures of faith on record.
   I can fancy the heathen nations around, if they witnessed the scene,
   sneering at the folly and presumption of a people who could thus act.
   They must have known only too well that they could not trust their gods
   after such a fashion. But I think their cry afterwards must have been,
   "Surely no people have a god like unto these people!" And could the
   world but see more of this sublime sort of faith among Christians now,
   I feel sure they would be won to yield allegiance to a God who can thus
   be trusted, and who never fails His people's confidence.

   But as this was an untrodden path to Israel, the Ark of the Covenant,
   which in one aspect typifies Christ, was in to precede them in this
   journey, "that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not
   passed this way heretofore," ii. 4. The path of faith is always a new
   and untrodden way to the soul, and it is only by "looking unto Jesus"
   that we can ever "know the way by which we must go."

   The crossing of the Jordan, it seems to me, is a type of death and
   resurrection; not the death of the body, but the death to sin spoken of
   in Rom. vi. and elsewhere, and the resurrection to newness of life now;
   as declared in Rom. vi. 4. "Therefore we are buried with him by baptism
   into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the
   glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
   It is the believer by faith reckoning himself to be "dead indeed unto
   sin, but alive unto God in Jesus Christ our Lord." At the Red Sea,
   death also was the type, but our share there was more that of entering
   into the accomplished results of the death and resurrection of Christ,
   by knowing our sins to be forgiven, and by realizing our translation
   out of the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of God's dear Son. While
   here the type is our being crucified with Christ, and realizing our
   resurrection life of holiness and separation in Him. As Paul says,
   "knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of
   sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin," Rom.
   vi. 6. Here in type, it seems to me, we do what Paul exhorts us to do
   in Eph. iv. 22-24, "That ye put off concerning the former conversation
   the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be
   renewed in the spirit of your mind. And that ye put on the new man,
   which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."

   To look at it practically and experimentally, I mean that this crossing
   of the Jordan typifies the crossing of the soul out of the experience
   of the seventh chapter of Romans into the experience of the eighth. It
   is the step by which the believer who has been justified, comes to know
   what it is to be sanctified also. It is in short the obeying of the
   command, "Reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, and
   alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord." It is dying with Christ
   by faith, in order to be raised with Him into newness of life.

   In experience this is an intensely practical thing. For nothing so
   gives victory over sin as to reckon one's self to be dead to it, and
   nothing so enables the soul to walk in righteousness as to realize its
   resurrection life in Christ. It may be difficult to explain this
   theologically or doctrinally; but to my mind the great point in
   studying the Bible is to get at its truths experimentally; and
   thousands of witnesses can testify to the blessed reality of being dead
   to sin and alive to God in Jesus Christ. I have known life-long
   besetments conquered in this way, that had not yielded one iota to all
   the struggles and efforts of years. I knew a lady with such an
   irritable temper that it was almost intolerable to live with her. She
   was a Christian, and she grieved over it with bitter sorrow, but seemed
   to find it impossible to get the victory by years of struggling and
   agonizing. Finally when she was almost in despair, she was told by one
   who knew the way of faith, to reckon herself dead to it, and that if
   she did, God would make it real by the power of His Spirit. In her
   despair she grasped at the hope, and kneeling before her open Bible
   with her finger on Rom. vi. 11, she dared to obey the divine command
   and reckoned herself, on the authority of God's own word, to be dead
   indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ. It seemed
   like a step off from a fearful precipice into a sheer abyss. But the
   step of faith, found, as it always does, the rock beneath, and
   according to her faith it was unto her. She met every temptation to
   irritability by saying, "I am dead to sin. I am crucified with Christ.
   I am alive in Him," and from that hour, now for many years, not even an
   inward ruffle has disturbed her peace.

   Take the step of faith then, dear friends, into the brimming flood, and
   in obedience to God, apprehend your position as dead and risen with
   Christ and in Christ; and henceforth walk as those ought to walk who
   are indeed alive from the dead.

   The twelve stones left in Jordan's bed, and the twelve brought out and
   set up as memorials, in chapter iv. both show the twelve tribes of
   Israel as being actual sharers in the death and resurrection, iv. 21,
   22, and are a symbol of our union with Christ in these.

   Chapter v. gives us the circumcision at Gilgal. "For ye are dead, and
   your life is hid with Christ in God.* * Mortify therefore your members
   which are upon the earth." Col. iii. 3, 5.

   If we are indeed dead to sin, it is necessary that we should
   practically realize it. Col. iii. 10-12 expresses this. Self must be
   mortified before victories can be won. The reproach of Egypt must be
   rolled away, ver. 9, before we can take possession of Jericho. We must
   always bear about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, if we would
   have the life of Jesus manifested in our mortal flesh. 2 Cor. vi. 10,
   11. And until this is done we cannot eat of the "old corn of the land,"
   vers. 11, 12; which means, I think, a feeding on Christ in a far deeper
   sense, than was typified by the manna, even that which is set forth in
   John vi. 48-56, "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood,
   dwelleth in me and I in him." Furthermore, when we have passed through
   the circumcision of Gilgal, we find ourselves in a place where we can
   have a revelation of our Captain, and can roll upon Him all the burden
   and the responsibility of our warfare. Vers. 13-15.

   Chapter vi. gives us the taking of Jericho, one of those very cities
   "great, and walled up to Heaven," which had discouraged the heart of
   the people forty years before. The Lord Himself arranged the plan of
   the capture, and in it, I believe, gave us a sample of the "fight of
   faith." The people of Israel had no weapons of warfare with which to
   meet their enemies, nor any battering rams for those mighty walls. They
   had nothing but their God and their faith. Their part was simply to
   march and to shout. The Lord's part was to make the walls fall down,
   and to conquer their enemies. 2 Cor. x. 4. "For the weapons of our
   warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of
   strongholds." And therefore we read in Heb. xi. 30: "By faith the walls
   of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days."
   Prudence would have said, "Do not shout until the walls show some signs
   of tottering," but faith said, while yet the walls seemed as firm as
   ever, "Shout, for the Lord hath given you the city." vi. 16. "So the
   people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to
   pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people
   shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the
   people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they
   took the city." vi. 20.

   And so likewise I believe the Christian is called to shout the shout of
   victory over his foes, even at the moment perhaps when they seem
   stronger than ever. I mean just this, that if we meet our enemy as an
   already conquered foe, and claim by faith our victory over him in
   Christ, we shall overcome far more quickly, than if we look upon him as
   an enemy who has yet to be conquered by our vigorous conflict against
   him. "This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith." I
   John, v. 4. And I have found experimentally that the little words
   "Jesus saves me, Jesus saves me now," repeated over and over, in any
   great stress of temptation, will bring a far more speedy victory than I
   can gain in any other way. For our Lord Himself says, "That whosoever
   shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed and be thou cast into the
   sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those
   things that he saith shall come to pass, be sell eve whatsoever he
   saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire when ye
   pray, believe that you receive them, and ye shall have them." Mark xi.
   23, 24.

   This victory at Jericho was followed by a disastrous defeat at Ai, in
   chapter vii., caused by a hidden sin. In the life of faith, our only
   strength is in the Lord, and if any indulged evil shall cause Him to
   withdraw His strength, we find ourselves utterly unable to "stand
   before our enemies," vii. 11-13. Nothing but perfect integrity of heart
   before the Lord can ensure a continuous victory. This whole story of
   the taking of Ai contains most striking teaching, concerning the causes
   of failure and the way to deal with it, in this life of faith, but I
   cannot here enlarge on it.

   From chapters ix.-xii. we have an account of the further conquest of
   the land, full of many deeply interesting lessons of the overcoming by
   faith. "So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord
   said unto Moses, and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel
   according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from
   war." xi. 23.

   In chapters xiii.-xxii. we have the story of the partition of the land
   among the tribes of Israel, with the appointing of the cities of
   refuge, and the assigning of their inheritance to the Levites. All
   being, I doubt not, typical of that which is set before us in I Cor.
   xii., and elsewhere, "Now there the diversities of gifts, but the same
   Spirit." * * * "But all these worketh that one and the self-same
   Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will."

   Chapters xxiii. and xxiv. give us Joshua's closing words to the people
   he was about to leave; an address which in many things reminds us
   forcibly of Paul's farewell address to the elders of the Ephesian
   church, Acts xx. Both Joshua and Paul foresaw evil days for the flocks
   over whom they had so faithfully watched, both warned them against the
   corruption of evil association and companionship, and both also assured
   them of the power of the Lord to deliver, if they would but trust Him.
   And in the case of both, I doubt not that there was already cause for
   much sorrow of heart. The Israelites had lost the freshness of their
   early zeal, and had become "slack to go up" and possess the land of
   their inheritance. Large portions of it remained still in possession of
   their enemies, and the leaven of these associations was working among
   them. Therefore Joshua, gathering the elders and judges and officers of
   the people around him in Shechem, xxiv. 1, seeks to stir them up to a
   fresh consecration of themselves to God, before be should be called to
   leave them. He reminds them of all the way by which the Lord had led
   them, of the deliverances He had wrought, and the victories He had
   granted, and closes with an enumeration of the gifts He had bestowed as
   an incentive to a whole-hearted surrender of themselves to Him. "I have
   given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built
   not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye
   planted not do ye eat. Now therefore fear the Lord and serve Him in
   sincerity and in truth; and put away the gods which your fathers served
   on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.
   And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day
   whom ye will serve." Won by Joshua's eloquence, and convinced in their
   hearts that no service could make them so happy as the service of the
   Lord their God, the people answered and said, "God forbid that we
   should forsake the Lord to serve other gods." And when Joshua tried to
   show them the danger there was of failure, they but reiterated their
   promises over and over, "Nay; but we will serve the Lord." "The Lord
   our God will we serve, and His voice will we obey." * * * And Joshua
   wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great
   stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of
   the Lord. And Joshua said unto all the people, "Behold, this stone
   shall be a witness unto us." xxiv. 14-25.

   Beloved, have we not come also to a Shechem in our own experience, when
   with full purpose of heart we have given ourselves to the Lord our God
   to serve Him and Him only? And shall we not seek for a stone of witness
   to be raised up before our Lord, that in days to come when our enemies
   shall try to entice us from our allegiance, will hold us to our
   covenant in better fashion than Israel was held, even the witness and
   the seal of the indwelling Spirit, who comes to fill and possess every
   fully consecrated soul?

   "And it came to pass after these things that Joshua died." And the
   significant announcement is made that Israel served the Lord "all the
   days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua,
   which had known all the works of the Lord, that He had done for
   Israel;" thus preparing us somewhat for the sad story of failure that
   is to follow in the book of Judges.

   Their Joshua died. But our Joshua never dies; and we, if we serve the
   Lord all our days, will serve Him forever, and need never in our
   experience go out of this book of triumph, nor know the sorrows and
   bondage of the book of failures that here succeeds it.

CHAPTER IX.

JUDGES.

  THE FAILURE OF THE REDEEMED IN HEAVENLY PLACES.

  Keynote: I Cor. iii. 1-4.

   THE book of Judges is a book of failure. We see God's redeemed people
   here, living in the land of their inheritance, with all their enemies
   subdued before them, and yet continually overcome and enslaved by the
   inhabitants of the land. It seems to me to be in type the story of the
   dangers and temptations which beset the soul that is seated in heavenly
   places in Christ, and the enemies they are likely to meet there; and is
   a book of warning written for our admonition "to the intent that we
   should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted."

   The whole story of this book may be given in a few verses out of the
   second chapter. "And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of
   the Lord, and served Baalim: and they forsook the Lord God of their
   fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed
   other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and
   bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord to anger. And they
   forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. And the anger of the
   Lord was hot against Israel, and He delivered them into the hands of
   spoilers that spoiled them, and He sold them into the hands of their
   enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before
   their enemies. Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was
   against them for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn
   unto them: and they were greatly distressed. Nevertheless the Lord
   raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that
   spoiled them. And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but
   they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them:
   they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in,
   obeying the commandments of the Lord; but they did not so. And when the
   Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and
   delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the
   judge: for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of
   them that oppressed them and vexed them."

   This state of things went on from bad to worse. Each restoration was
   followed by a long season of backsliding, until finally we find nothing
   but confusion and failure on every hand, with no hope of deliverance,
   and the book closes with this sad record of the utter absence of rule
   or control. "In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did
   that which was right in his own eyes." xxi. 25.

   And this history of Israel is too often found to be the history of the
   Church, or of individual souls. The failures and the restorations
   correspond to the times of deadness and wandering in the church, or in
   the Christian, and the seasons of revival which for a little while
   deliver them from this backsliding. The church, or the individual
   Christian, is carried captive by the world, the flesh, or the devil;
   old and apparently conquered forms of evil are continually reappearing
   on the scene, which mightily oppress the children of God, as Israel was
   oppressed under their enemies; and they cry unto the Lord, as Israel
   did, and the Lord raises up a deliverer in the form of some great
   leader, such as Luther, or some fresh revelation of a neglected and
   forgotten truth; such as justification by faith, or the second coming
   of Christ, and for a time the land has rest again and is in quietness,
   until the enemies afresh rise up to enslave and overcome.

   Two causes lay at the root of Israel's backsliding, and I believe they
   are the very causes that lie at the root of all Christian backsliding
   also. They compromised with evil, and they worshipped idols. The whole
   land of Canaan had been given to the children of Israel, "from the
   wilderness and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river
   Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea, toward
   the going down of the sun." And the command of the Lord to them
   concerning it was, "When ye are passed over Jordan, into the land of
   Canaan, then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
   before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their
   molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places: and ye shall
   dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have
   given you the land to possess it. * * * But if ye will not drive out
   the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to
   pass, that those which yet remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes,
   and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye
   dwell." Num. xxxiii. 51-56. "They shall not dwell in thy land, lest
   they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will
   surely be a snare unto thee." Ex. xxiii. 33.

   Moreover He also promised them a sure possession of it, saying, "Every
   place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given
   unto you. * * * There shall not any man be able to stand before thee
   all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so will I be with thee.
   I will not fail thee nor forsake thee." Josh. i. 3, 5.

   The land of promise was therefore all theirs in the purpose of God, and
   all they had to do was to step upon it and claim it for their own. But
   we see, even in Joshua, that in spite of all this there yet remained
   very much land to be possessed, and the people were "slack to go up and
   possess it." xiii. 1, and xviii. 3. And here in the first chapter of
   Judges we find, that they seem to have given up entirely all hope or
   expectation of driving out the inhabitants of the land, or even in many
   cases of dispossessing them from their dwelling-places. We read over
   and over, "And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
   that inhabited Jerusalem." i. 21. "Neither did Manasseh drive out tile
   inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns; * *
   * but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. * * Neither did Ephraim
   drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer. * * Neither did Zebulun
   drive out the inhabitants of Kitron. * * * Neither did Asher drive out
   the inhabitants of Accho, * * but the Asherites dwelt among the
   Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them
   out." And it is all summed up in this, "And it came to pass when Israel
   was strong that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly
   drive them out," i. 28. They might have done it but they did not. And
   as a consequence we find in the second chapter that the triumphant
   experience of Gilgal is exchanged for the weeping of Bochim. Comp .
   Josh. v. 9-12 with Judges ii. 1-5. And the Lord who had said concerning
   their enemies in Joshua., "and the Lord your God, He shall expel them
   from before you and drive them out of your sight; and ye shall possess
   their land, as the Lord your God hath promised unto you;" now says, "I
   will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be as thorns in
   your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you."

   Because they would not drive out their enemies when they were strong
   and could have done it, the Lord now refuses to enable them to do it
   any more; and from henceforth throughout the whole story of the book of
   Judges, although we have many records of victories over their enemies,
   we read of no more being driven out; but find instead, that, as they
   had been warned, so it resulted, and these very enemies who had been
   made tribute in the days of their strength, rose up in the days of
   their weakness and enslaved and oppressed them.

   The lesson of all this for us is, that since the command of our Lord to
   us as Christians is that we should drive out every enemy from our
   hearts and lives, and should permit none to dwell among us, if we
   refuse to do this, and, instead of utterly driving them out, seek
   merely to make them tribute to us, we shall find ourselves continually
   enslaved and oppressed by those very enemies whom we have suffered to
   remain. The promise to Israel was that not a man should be able to
   stand before them all the days of their life, because the Lord would be
   with them and His strength would always give them the victory. And the
   promise to us is that we shall be delivered by the power of our Lord
   from the hands of all our enemies, and shall be enabled always to
   triumph in every contest with our foe. But if we, as they, refuse to
   avail ourselves fully of this promised strength, and use it only to
   make our enemies tribute, instead of driving them out utterly, we shall
   suffer the same results. This accounts for the condition of so many
   Christians, who and themselves enslaved and oppressed continually by
   their inward enemies, and whose victories, even when they cry to the
   Lord and are victorious, are yet followed by ever recurring defeats.
   They groan under it and cannot understand it. But the secret lies in
   this, that they have not utterly driven out their enemies. They have
   thought perhaps that they could not. They have said, it may be, "My
   circumstances are so peculiar, or my temperament is so sensitive, or my
   temptations are so great;" and excusing themselves on these accounts,
   they have not even expected to be entirely delivered from their
   irritable tempers, or their roots of bitterness, or their seasons of
   discouragement, or their sharp tongues, but have felt themselves very
   successful if they have been able to make these things tributary, as it
   were, and have managed to keep them under by constant watchfulness and
   prayer. And so they compromise with the enemy, instead of utterly
   driving him out. In this way many Christians compromise with doubt, or
   with the disobedience of timidity, or with a shrinking from saying "Thy
   will be done," or with anxiety, or with a hundred other forms of evil,
   against which God's commands of utter renunciation and death have
   plainly gone forth. And as a consequence He no longer drives out the
   enemies we have consented shall remain, and they are indeed snares and
   traps unto us, and scourges in our sides, and thorns in our eyes.

   Dear reader, this is exceedingly practical to thee. Hast thou permitted
   any of thy enemies to dwell in thy midst? Art thou seeking only to put
   them to tribute, and hesitating to utterly drive them out? If so, do
   not wonder at the enslavement and misery that oppress thee. Be sure
   that in the Lord's order it could not be otherwise, and that he alone
   who reckons himself dead, not to a few only of his sins, but to every
   sin, can gain the continual victories, and live the life of uniform
   triumph. And I think it is just in this that the great difference
   arises in the experiences of those who enter into the land of promise
   now. With some, self seems to be swallowed up at once by the revelation
   of Christ, and to lift up its head no more; while with others the death
   of self is accomplished only by slow degrees and through great
   conflicts. The triumphant experience under Joshua is a type of the
   first, and the failing experience of Judges is a type of the second.
   Through death to life is always God's way, and there is no other. If we
   would live, we must first die. We must lose our own life, if we would
   find the life that is hid with Christ in God. We must reckon ourselves
   dead before we can reckon ourselves to be alive. And the more thorough
   and wide-reaching is the death, the more all-pervading and victorious
   will be the life. Is it not a grand proposal of the gospel then that we
   should put off at once and always the old man, and put on forever the
   new man? And shall we hesitate to do it?

   For to us the declaration is as sure as to them, that every place that
   the foot of our faith shall tread upon, that shall be ours. "What
   things soever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and
   ye shall have them." Mark xi. 22-24. "Believing" is to us what
   "stepping the foot upon" was to them. The land of promise lies spread
   out before us, and in the purpose of the Lord is already ours. We are
   responsible therefore for actually taking possession of it. And our
   Lord has promised that He will be with us all the days of our life, and
   that we shall be made more than conquerors through Him. Let us then, in
   the power of the Holy Ghost, step out on each promise as it is made
   known to us, and confidently claim it as ours. And let us drive out
   every inhabitant of the land and make no league with any, but
   "cleansing ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit," let
   us "perfect holiness in the fear of the Lord."

   I knew a poor Christian woman whose life was made bitter to her through
   the sufferings and remorse caused by the combination of an exceedingly
   irritable temper and circumstances of peculiar trial. She had struggled
   against it, and sought to keep it tributary with all her might during
   many years, but was continually finding it rising up and oppressing
   her, until she was almost in despair. Among other things she was
   obliged every morning to have a late breakfast for a son whose work
   kept him out late at night, and who therefore slept long in the
   morning. She was a tidy woman who liked to get her work done and things
   cleaned up, and this daily recurrence of a late and uncertain breakfast
   hour, which kept her pots and pans standing around, and her stove
   uncleaned, was a source of continual provocation. She knew it was not
   only unchristian, but unreasonable as well, and each day she resolved
   that the next morning she would control herself and be sweet, but the
   fresh provocation always overcame her, and her life was a burden to
   her. She even longed for death to set her free. But she heard at last
   of another sort of death that would deliver her. She was told of the
   glorious possibilities of being made dead to sin by faith in Christ,
   and the command was brought home to her to "reckon herself dead." In
   great weakness, but in simple faith, she obeyed this command, and began
   thus to reckon. Peace and rest flowed into her heart, and when the
   temptations came next she found herself possessed of an inward
   sweetness that made all the old annoyances matters of perfect
   indifference to her. Her son who had been used to cross looks and words
   during his late breakfasts watched her in amazement the first morning,
   and at last said, "Why, mother, what is the matter with you? Has
   anything happened to you?" "Yes, Albert," she replied, "something has
   happened. Your mother is dead." "Dead!" he exclaimed, "Why mother what
   do you mean?" The mother explained it to him as well as she could; and
   he listened in amazement. Morning after morning he watched her, and
   finally he said "Well, mother, if you are going to be dead every
   morning, it makes you so lovely, that I am going to try to get to bed
   earlier, so as to come down early in the morning and see you."

   Let us die then. "He that is dead is freed from sin," the Bible tells
   us, and we know it must be so. And I believe it is the only freedom
   that is really effectual or lasting.

   But a worse evil than enslavement came from these enemies left in the
   land. Idolatry swiftly followed in the train. As we read in chapter ii.
   7-10, iii. 7, "And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua,
   and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
   the great works of the Lord that He did for Israel. And Joshua, the son
   of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, * * * also all that generation
   were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation
   after them which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which He had done
   for Israel. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the
   Lord, and forgat the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves."

   The typical teaching of this sin of idolatry, is, I think, very much
   misunderstood. Many think it means only loving some dear one too much,
   or being too fond of some earthly comfort or pleasure. But to my mind
   idolatry means a far graver sin. It meant among the Israelites
   worshipping a false god, and it means the same now among Christians.
   And it matters little whether this god is one carved out of wood or
   stone, or carved out of our own imaginings. If our thought or idea of
   Him is in any way different from the Lord whom the Bible reveals, we
   are as really in so far worshipping an idol, as though we had built up
   for ourselves a god of wood. And in this sense idolatry is a far more
   common sin in these days than some of you have been used to think. Let
   me illustrate what I mean by a most common occurrence. How many people
   say to their children continually all through their childhood, "the
   Lord does not love naughty children, and now that you are naughty, He
   does not love you." Nothing more directly contrary to the Bible, nor
   more untrue of the God of the Bible, could be taught; for there we are
   told that "God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son"
   to die for it; and that on account of "His great love wherewith He
   loved us; even when we were dead in trespasses and sins, "He quickened
   us; and that He commendeth His love toward us, in that even while we
   were yet sinners Christ died for us." Surely then to teach the innocent
   little children such a sad untruth as this, is to set up an idol for
   them to worship. And when they grow older and are compelled to learn
   that the God of the Bible is other and different from what they have
   been taught; that He hates only the sin but loves the sinner, and that
   even when they are naughty, His forgiving love is calling upon them to
   come to Him and be saved, is it to be wondered at that they are so
   wedded to their false idea of Him, as to find it very difficult and
   often almost impossible to believe that He can really be what the Bible
   declares Him to be, and to worship Him as He is there revealed? My
   heart aches at the thought of the idols being fashioned in so many
   nurseries at this very day for the little ones to worship; and I feel
   that the heathen mother who leads her child to the heathen temple and
   makes it bow down before the image of wood or of stone, is hardly so
   responsible as these Christian mothers, who, with the Bible in their
   hands, can yet fashion such a false God for the imaginings of their
   children. I speak strongly for I feel strongly. I believe many a soul
   has thus been burdened, even in the nursery, with such false ideas of
   God, as never to be able in this life to shake off the doubts and
   discouragements they have caused. And I am convinced that the amount of
   this sort of idolatry in the Church to-day would be appalling, if we
   could but see it in all its magnitude and deformity.

   And for each of us personally, dear friends, it is a solemn question,
   as to how far we are guilty of this sin. Are we sure we are
   worshipping, and trusting, and loving, just the God whom Christ
   reveals, or have we let in some false notions concerning Him, which
   have made Him appear to us other than He really is? Do we for instance
   really believe that He loves us individually? Do we believe that He has
   blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Christ, and that He will
   freely give us all things? Do we believe that He has actually made with
   every temptation a way of escape, that we may be able to bear it? Do we
   believe that He does truly care for us in all the little affairs of our
   lives, even to the very numbering of the hairs of our heads, and that
   He will carry every burden and bear every sorrow for us, if we will but
   let Him? Or does He seem to us like a hard task master, too far off and
   too grand to take much note of our petty personal trials or needs, and
   giving us impossible commands which He knows we are not able to obey?

   I entreat of you, dear friends, to search and see how it is with you in
   this matter. For sure I am that idolatry of any sort, whether of
   outward fashioning or inward, is most grievous to our Lord, and most
   disastrous to us.

   The children of Israel it appears served the true God as long as any
   were alive who remembered the wonderful deliverance out of Egypt, but
   when Joshua died and all the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen
   all the great works of the Lord that He did for Israel, then they soon
   forgot him and served other gods. And I think this is significant of
   one form of idolatry which perhaps is peculiar to the higher stages of
   Christian experience. The soul, becoming absorbed in the deeper truths
   of our religion, is apt to lose sight of the fundamental doctrine of
   coming out of Egypt, or of justification by faith, and to speak and to
   think so exclusively of the fruits of the Spirit, and the life and walk
   of the believer, as almost or even quite to forget the necessity of
   pressing the foundation truths of salvation, and the way of entrance
   into the spiritual life. This leads to a onesided statement of truth,
   that may become very dangerous, especially to the soul which has had no
   clear teaching on the other side; and may end in very false views of
   God. May the lessons of warning contained in our book save us each one
   from such mistakes.

   Chapter iii. gives us the story of the three first captivities, and the
   deliverers who were raised up in answer to the people's cry. iii. 9,
   15, 31. Whenever they cried the Lord delivered them. Let their sin
   against Him have been ever so great, or their slavery to their enemies
   ever so hopeless, still we always read that when they cried, then He
   delivered them. A beautiful type of the truth taught in I John i. 9,
   "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." When we confess,
   then He forgives and cleanses. At once, without any delay. And we must
   believe that He does, and rejoice in our deliverance.

   Chapters iv. and v. give us the story of Deborah, and her song of
   victory. I cannot but think that all these deliverers are types of some
   especial forms of the revivals the Lord sends when His people cry. But
   I do not feel prepared to enter upon this. To me however Deborah seems
   to set forth most strikingly the lesson of God's strength made perfect
   in our weakness. A woman here leads the armies of the Lord against a
   captain who had nine hundred chariots of iron, and who for twenty years
   mightily oppressed the children of Israel; and even Barak, whose name
   means thunder, the strong captain in Israel, dared not go without her.
   "If thou wilt go with me," he said, "then I will go; but if thou wilt
   not go with me then I will not go." iv, 8. A picture it seems to me of
   Paul's teaching in 2 Cor. xii. 7-10, "when I am weak then I am strong."
   And a striking illustration of the truth that God hath chosen the weak
   things of the world to confound the mighty, that no flesh might glory
   in his presence. For Deborah said, "I will surely go with thee:
   notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine
   honor; for the Lord shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman." iv. 9.

   Chapters vi., vii. and viii. give us the story of the captivity under
   Midian and the deliverance wrought out for them by Gideon. So low had
   the Israelites fallen by their repeated failures, that at first one man
   only is found faithful enough to be called into the work. Gideon's
   first thought is of his own weakness, vi. 15, and he said, "O my Lord,
   wherewith shall I save Israel? behold my family is poor in Manasseh,
   and I am the least in my father's house?" But the Lord's answer shows
   him the secret of strength, "Surely I will be with thee." And the whole
   story reveals to us this one grand fact that in was the Lord who
   worked, and He alone. "And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that
   are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their
   hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand
   hath saved me." And Gideon finally learns the lesson the Lord was
   seeking to teach by means of all His dealings with him, and is willing
   to trust Him with entire confidence, so that with only three hundred
   men armed with trumpets, and empty pitchers, with lamps within the
   pitchers, he was not afraid to attack the mighty host that "lay all
   along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude;" and whose camels
   were "without number as the sand by the sea side for multitude." vii.
   12, 16. And so mighty was the influence of this display of overcoming
   faith upon the children of Israel, and so complete was the rout of
   their enemies, that for forty years afterward their country was in
   quietness, and they served the Lord. viii. 28.

   But no sooner was Gideon dead, than we read that the "children of
   Israel turned again and went a whoring after Baalim, and made
   Baalberith their god." viii. 33. And in chapter ix. we have a sad scene
   of confusion and sin caused by divisions among themselves. Faith had
   failed, and contention and strife entered.

   Chapter x. shows us the increasingly sad results of Israel's repeated
   failures. Ashen they cried to the Lord here He could not at once grant
   them the deliverance they sought. He had first to deal with their
   consciences to make them know the depth of their backsliding and of
   their need. "Ye have forsaken me," He said "and served other gods;
   wherefore I wilt deliver you no more. Go and cry unto the gods which ye
   have chosen: let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation." x.
   13, 14. But he could not long delay His goodness, for "His soul was
   grieved for the misery of Israel." And in chapter xi. He raised up
   another deliverer, Jephthah, who again subdued their enemies and set
   them free. But although this was a real deliverance, yet the instrument
   used, the captain of a band of vain men, and the results in Jephthah's
   own sorrow, and the quarrel with Ephraim, chap. xii., show how low
   Israel had fallen, that even their recovery was of so poor a sort.

   Chapter xiii. opens with the sad and oft repeated words, "And the
   children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord." And now,
   so repeated had been their failures and so weakening had been the
   effect, that none but a Nazarite can be used as the deliverer. xiii. 5.
   Nazariteship is a type of entire separation to God. See Num. iv. And in
   this case the enemy who had assumed dominion over Israel were the
   Philistines, who were not a scourge sent from without, but a plague
   dwelling within their own territory; and against an evil within,
   nothing but the spirit of entire separation to God can give victory.
   xiii, 24-25. Therefore to Samson, the one Nazarite in all Israel, as
   far as appears, it is given to plague and harass the Philistines
   continually, and to keep them in check. But he alone could not entirely
   conquer them, much less extirpate them; and from this time forward,
   until the time of David, they remained to be Israel's bitterest foes.
   And even Samson himself, Nazarite though he was, had a walk of only
   intermittent faithfulness, and brought himself into great trouble, by
   disobedience to the Lord's express command against inter-marriages with
   the nations who dwelt in the land, in taking one of the daughters of
   the Philistines for his wife, xiv. 1-2. The Lord, however, who can and
   does, make all things, even our mishaps, work together for good to them
   who love Him, used this connection to punish the Philistines. xiv. 4.

   Again, after the death of his wife, another connection with the
   Philistines brought him into even greater trouble, leading him to
   betray the Lord's secret, xvi. 5-20, and is the occasion in the end of
   his losing his life; although this too God used to punish the
   Philistines, and help Israel, xvi. 30.

   From this time forward no deliverer was raised up for Israel, nor does
   it appear that they even cried for one. So hardened had they become by
   the long course of sin and idolatry, that they no longer felt the yoke
   of their enemy. Mind and conscience had become defiled, and to them was
   fulfilled what Paul described as being characteristic of the latter
   times, in I Tim. iv. 1-2, "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in
   the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to
   seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy;
   having their conscience seared with a hot iron." And the remaining
   chapters of our book lift the veil from the inner life of the
   Israelites, and show us to what length this apostasy had really gone.
   Heretofore they had forsaken the Lord and worshipped idols, but now
   they turn the very worship of God Himself into idolatry; chapter xvii.
   and xviii., "every man doing that which was right in his own eyes,"
   xvii. 6. "And the children of Dan set up the graven image; and Jonathan
   the son of Gershon, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests
   to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. And
   they set them up Micah's graven image, which he had made, all the time
   that the house of God was in Shiloh." xviii. 30-31.

   The book closes in the final chapters on a scene of sin and confusion,
   and strife, almost unparalleled in the history of Israel. Their
   continual backsliding of heart had at last produced its legitimate
   outward results in the lives of the people, and self-will and license
   seemed to have nothing to restrain them, and the book ends, as I have
   remarked before, with the ominous words, "In those days there was no
   king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
   xxi. 25.

   The lessons of this book are sad and painful, but deeply needed, I am
   sure. No position in grace, no height of Christian attainment can keep
   the soul from failing. Only the present power of an indwelling Holy
   Ghost can do this, and nothing but continual faithfulness to the Lord
   can secure His abiding presence. We never, at any stage of our
   experience reach a place where we may relax in our obedience, or become
   indifferent in our trust. Obedience must keep pace with knowledge, and
   our trust must be daily and hourly fixed on our keeping Saviour, or all
   will go wrong. Sanctification is not a state so much as a walk, and
   every moment of that walk we need the Spirit's power and the Spirit's
   presence as much as we did at first. Not even after dwelling in the
   land of promise for many years, are we strong enough to do without
   this. Always from the beginning to the end of our Christian life,
   obedience and trust are the two essential conditions of our triumph. We
   must make no more compromise with evil at the end than at the
   beginning. And failure, if it comes, will always arise from one or the
   other of these two causes, either want of consecration or want of
   trust. It is never the strength of our enemies, nor our own weakness
   that causes us to fall. While the Lord continues to be with us, no man
   can stand before us all the days of our life; and if we will only
   steadfastly abide in Him, we need not be in the least discouraged at
   the thought of the temptations that surround us on every hand.

   But, let me repeat it, there must be no compromise with sin. By faith
   we must put to death every one of our enemies, every day of our lives.
   And this death is a real thing. Our faith reckons it, and the Lord
   makes it real. The faith is our part, but the process is His, And the
   faith is a very different thing from the process. As the Rev. Andrew
   Jukes of England once wrote to a friend here, "The faith that you can
   come to Europe in ten days, and that if you take a ticket all is done
   for you, is a very different thing from the voyage itself, and the
   actual experience of crossing the Atlantic; and just so the joy of
   faith that in Christ you are already perfect, is not the same thing as
   the experience of being made perfect through suffering, even as He was.
   But this and this only is the royal road."

   I mean therefore, a reality in all that I say. And realities are what
   we want. We cannot put up with any thing merely judicial here. We must
   have our enemies actually to die, and our souls to be actually
   delivered from them, or there is no peace or security. Always "bearing
   about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus," is the sole pathway to
   having His divine life of sweetness and power, manifested in our mortal
   flesh. But who would shrink with such an end in view? Who would not
   gladly cut off hand or foot or eye, if by so doing the death to self
   and the life in Christ could be practically reached?

   Consent then to die. Let the Lord send crosses or afflictions or pain,
   if only by these He will but rid us of pride, and self-will, and anger,
   and all others of our inward enemies, and will conform us in every
   thing to the image of Christ. Let us, if Israel did not, obey the
   command of our Lord to drive out every enemy from our land, and then we
   need have no fear that the sad and God dishonoring experience of the
   book of Judges will be ours.

CHAPTER X.

RUTH.

  UNION WITH CHRIST.

  Keynote: Eph. vi. 22-32.

   THE book of Ruth is considered by many students of the typical teaching
   of Scripture, to be a type of the union of Christ and the Church. It is
   the story of the marriage of a Gentile bride to an Israelitish
   bridegroom, a thing forbidden in the Jewish law, and yet here approved
   of God, and made an especial blessing to those concerned in it. As we
   have seen in Judges, the Israelites had grievously failed, and had
   forsaken the God of their fathers to worship Baalim and Ashtaroth. All
   was confusion and sin in Israel. In the midst of this confusion, where
   Israel had so failed, a Gentile is brought in and exalted to a place of
   especial honor. And in all this we seem to see a type of that which
   Paul declares in Acts xiii. 46. "It was necessary that the word of God
   should first have been spoken to you; but seeing you put it from you,
   and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the
   Gentiles." It is a typical foreshadowing of the truth set forth in Rom.
   xi. Some of the branches are here "broken off," and the "wild olive" is
   "graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness
   of the olive tree." "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be
   ignorant of this mystery, . . that blindness in part is happened to
   Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in." I believe this
   picture was meant to be hung up in the great picture gallery of the Old
   Testament, as a type of the "mystery," which, Paul says, "in other ages
   was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto His
   holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; that the Gentiles should be
   fellow-heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of His promise in
   Christ by the gospel," Eph. iii. 3-6.

   It was, as we have seen, a sin for the Israelites to make any
   inter-marriages with the Gentile nations round about. And yet here a
   Moabitish woman is married to one of the chief men among the Jews, and
   is raised to a place of especial honor; teaching, as I think, in type,
   the lesson, that "by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body,
   whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have
   all been made to drink into one Spirit," I Cor. xii. 13.

   No doubt this interpretation of the book of Ruth will seem fanciful to
   some. But to me it is full of very blessed teaching. It expresses to my
   mind in a beautiful story of domestic life, the oneness of Christ and
   the Church, the blessed union, of which we are told in Eph. v. 32:
   "This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning Christ and the
   Church." Our Lord has chosen us to be His in a very near and tender
   sense. He says to us: "As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved
   you," John xv. 9. He loves us with so deep a love that He gave Himself
   for us; and He is continually seeking to win us to His side. He is the
   Bridegroom, and He tells us that "as the Bridegroom rejoices over the
   bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee."  . . . "For thy Maker is
   thine Husband: the Lord of Hosts is His name," Is. lxii. 5 and liv. 5.

   And I believe all this is intended to set before us a blessed
   experience of the love of Christ, which is far beyond our ordinary
   apprehensions, and which would indeed satisfy the hungriest heart; a
   love which would lift the soul out of the servant's place into the
   place of the bride, would change drudgery into delight, and cause us to
   rise, as one has said, "from law to love, from penance to purity, from
   poverty to power, from fainting to fulness, from sadness to sunlight,
   from indwelling sin to an indwelling Saviour, from widowhood to
   wedlock, from sorrowful mourning to a heavenly marriage."

   The story in this little book is concerning the time in the history of
   Israel to which we have been brought in Judges, when all was in
   confusion, and the Lord seemed to be left almost without a witness,
   even among His own chosen people.

   It opens with a famine, i. 1; natural result of such a state of
   affairs. In consequence of this famine, an Israelite went to sojourn in
   the land of the Lord's enemies, doubtless in the hope of bettering his
   condition for a time, but probably with no thought of living and dying
   there. But we read in verse second that he "continued there." And it
   generally happens to any believer who goes among the Lord' s enemies to
   seek for the food which his own spiritual famine has made to seem a
   necessity, that, although it may have been his purpose merely to
   sojourn for a while, he also ends by "continuing there." The result of
   this long sojourn is that all Mahlon's household die but Naomi, who
   finds herself left a desolate widow with two widowed daughters. Then in
   her sorrow she hears "how that the Lord had visited His people in
   giving them bread." And she sets out to return unto her own land. But
   she had evidently so little faith in the God of Israel, whom yet she
   recognized as her God, that she urged her daughters not to go with her,
   afraid, doubtless, that it would involve them in new troubles and
   losses. Christians who have had only an experience of spiritual famine,
   can never be very earnest in urging others to come to dwell in their
   land, i. 8-15. Orpah yielded to her mother's entreaties, and returned
   "unto her people, and unto her gods." But Ruth clave unto her mother. I
   think that Ruth must have seen in this mother-in-law something of
   goodness or sweetness that had won her heart, and had made her believe
   that her mother's God must be better worth serving than her own gods.
   At all events she said to her those beautiful words of loving
   allegiance, "Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following
   after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest,
   I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: where
   thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to
   me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me," i. 16, 17.

   And when her mother saw that she was "steadfastly minded to go with
   her, she left off speaking unto her," i. 18. "So they two went until
   they came to Bethlehem . . . and they came to Bethlehem in the
   beginning of barley harvest," i. 19-22. What grace was here! Naomi left
   in a famine, but she returned in the time of harvest. And every
   backsliding soul that returns to the Lord always finds, as the prodigal
   did, a feast prepared for him.

   But better blessings even than the barley harvest were awaiting these
   returning wanderers, and blessings it had not entered into their hearts
   to conceive of. Ruth had not thought of finding a bridegroom and a home
   of her own in the land of Judah. She had gone there because her heart
   was desolate and lonely in her own land, and the religion of Naomi had
   attracted her. But almost at once upon her arrival, she went out to
   glean, and her "hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto
   Boaz," her "near kinsman," ii. 1-3.

   And so the souls, who turn their backs on the world to seek the Lord,
   even although very ignorant of all the blessings in store for them,
   find themselves soon gleaning in the field of Christ, who is our near
   Kinsman, and who, as Boaz did, "takes knowledge" of them, although they
   are strangers; and causes His servants to "let fall some handfuls of
   purpose" for them, that they may not go "to glean in another field,"
   but may "abide fast" by His people, ii. 8-13. Ruth had come to trust
   under the wings of the God of Israel; and no one ever yet trusted in
   Him and was confounded.

   This it seems to me is the first experience of the returning sinner. He
   leaves, figuratively speaking, his father, and his mother, and the land
   of his nativity, as Ruth did, and comes unto a people which he has not
   heretofore known, ii. 11. Then he begins to glean, and gathers in from
   the Lord's harvest fields spiritual food to supply his daily needs. And
   for a while the soul is satisfied with this.

   But a time comes when a deeper want is felt. "Then Naomi her
   mother-in-law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for
   thee, that it may be well with thee?" iii. 1. This expression, "seeking
   rest," meant among the Hebrews all that is contained in the sweet tie
   of married life, a home, and a care-taker, and all the joys of wedded
   union. And the soul of the believer begins sooner or later to hunger
   and thirst after this rest in a realized union with Christ, of which
   the marriage union is so precious a type.

   Very often some older Christian first urges the soul to press its claim
   for this, as Naomi did to Ruth. And where, as in Ruth's case, there is
   the true spirit of teachableness and submission on the part of the
   Christian, who has comparatively lately begun his course, towards those
   who are further advanced, he will learn his privileges far more
   quickly, than if left to his own crude conceptions and limited
   knowledge.

   In submission to the advice of Naomi, Ruth made her claim, using as her
   plea, "for thou art a near kinsman," iii. 9. The kinsman's plea was an
   unanswerable one among the Jews; and our Lord, in assuming the place of
   a kinsman, meant that we should have all the benefit of this plea. And
   His answer to us is always, like that of Boaz to Ruth, "And now, my
   daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest," iii.
   11.

   Even the very boldness of her claim pleased Boaz. "And he said, Blessed
   be thou of the Lord, my daughter, for thou hast showed more kindness in
   the latter end than in the beginning." At first she sought his gifts
   only, now she sought himself. The gleaner would be the wife. And just
   so it is with us. The work of Christ is our first knowledge; the person
   of Christ is our last. At first we are occupied with our needs, and
   come to the Lord simply to have them sup- plied. But at last we lose
   sight of the gifts in the Giver, and can be satisfied with nothing
   short of Himself. Our souls cry out for a personal Saviour. We want not
   only something to enjoy, and be thankful for, and use; but we want some
   One to love, and trust and serve. His manifested presence comes to be
   far more to us than His mercies. and nothing but a realized union with
   Himself can meet the craving of our heart's hunger. Having Him, we
   realize that we shall have all things, and without Him nothing is
   valuable to us. We say, in the language of the hymn--


   "Thy gifts, alas I cannot suffice,

   Unless Thyself be given;

   Thy presence makes my paradise,

   And where Thou art 'tis Heaven."

   Ruth's claim looked like presumption, but Boaz called it "showing
   kindness." And our Lord also delights in every claim we make upon Him
   for this realized oneness with Himself, however bold it may seem to us.
   It is indeed His own prayer for us, "That they all may be one; as thou
   Father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that
   the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou
   gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one;
   I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and
   that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as
   thou hast loved me." I believe indeed, that, far dearer to Him than the
   greatest activities of service, is the longing of the heart to know
   this oneness, and the claim of faith that comes boldly to His feet to
   receive it. "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the
   holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He hath
   consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, His flesh; and
   having a high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a
   true heart, in full assurance of faith," Heb. x. 19-22.


   "God loves to be longed for, He loves to be sought,

   For He sought us Himself with such longing and love;

   He died for desire of us, marvellous thought!

   And He yearns for us now to be with Him above."

   Having made her claim, Ruth then was simply to wait until she should
   see what Boaz would do, for Naomi said to her, "Sit still, my daughter,
   until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not be in
   rest until he have finished the thing this day," iii. 18. And to those
   souls who have been stirred up by the blessed Holy Spirit to see their
   need of a realized oneness with their Lord, and to make their claim for
   it, the same command comes to-day, "Sit still, my daughter, until thou
   know how the matter will fall." For the Lord Himself has declared, "For
   Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will
   not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and
   the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth," Isa. lxii. 1. This
   "sitting still" means faith. When there is anything to be done, none
   who are interested can sit still, unless they are sure that some one
   else has undertaken the matter, who is both able and trustworthy, and
   in whose hands they can feel that it is as safe as in their own. The
   soul that "sits still," therefore, is the soul that trusts. It has made
   its request known to the Lord, and it knows that He has taken the
   matter in hand and will surely "finish it" in His own time and way. And
   therefore it waits in patient faith, sure that it already has the
   petition it desired of Him, even before the realization of the
   fulfilment has come.

   I cannot but feel that we need more of this "sitting still" in
   Christian experience. There is too much restless anxiety about our
   prayers, too much of a feeling that unless we help in some way, or at
   least unless we wrestle and agonize over it, the matter cannot be
   finished satisfactorily at all. I saw an illustration of this not long
   ago which will explain what I mean. I was visiting a mother in her
   nursery, where her little boy was playing. We were talking on the
   subject of prayer, and asking each other the question as to what sort
   of praying was right -- the trusting kind, or the agonizing kind, when
   we were interrupted by the child's asking for some biscuit. His mother
   said "Yes" at once, and went to the closet for them, but found the
   biscuit can empty. She told the child the state of the case, but said
   she would send for some, and the child saw the nurse put on her bonnet,
   and take the money, and start out to make the purchase. A good child,
   upon this, would have gone to playing again, and would have waited
   quietly and trustingly until the biscuit came. But this child stood at
   his mother's elbow, saying over and over, first in a plaintive tone,
   which however rapidly rose to an agony of entreaty -- "Mother, give me
   biscuit. I want biscuit. Please let me have some biscuit. Do give me
   biscuit. I must have biscuit!" Until finally our conversation was
   drowned in the noise of his wailing, and we could do nothing but sit
   still in the best patience we could muster. My question about prayer
   was answered; and never from that time have I dared to agonize over any
   request I have made of the Lord. I do not mean, however, that we are to
   forget our prayers, or be indifferent to their results, but simply
   that, having made our request known, we must then wait in a quiet and
   patient faith, sure that our Lord will not rest until He has finished
   the matter we have put into His hands. We are not always prepared
   ourselves to receive an immediate answer to our prayers. We do not give
   the best things in our possession to our youngest children, even though
   they ask, lest they should hurt themselves, or spoil the things. We
   wait until they grow old enough to take the proper care of them, and to
   understand their use. A delicate watch would be only a burden to a five
   year old boy, and would be sure to come to grief. And our Father is too
   wise in His love, to give us what we are not yet prepared to receive.
   But when we ask Him, He will first make us ready for the gift, and will
   then bestow it, when we can receive and use it, without injury to the
   gift or loss to ourselves, for He "knows how to give good gifts" unto
   His children."

   In the case of Ruth something had to be done, before the request which
   she had made to Boaz could be fulfilled. And this was typical, I think,
   of that which must take place in our own case, when our souls come to
   the Lord, and ask for a more fully realized union with Himself. The
   claims of a kinsman nearer than Boaz had to be disposed of. "And now it
   is true that I am thy near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer
   than I . . . If he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well:
   let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
   kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee," iii.
   12, 13.

   This nearer kinsman may be taken as a type of the law, which is
   declared in Rom. vii. 1-4 to be, as it were, our first husband, having
   dominion over us until we are released from him by death. As we read
   there, "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by
   the body of Christ, that ye should be married to another, even to Him
   who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto
   God." Legality is the one great hindrance to a realized and conscious
   soul union with Christ. Just as it is in the earthly marriage relation,
   any thought of law as controlling the conduct of one to the other, or
   any service that springs only from a fear of consequences, in so far as
   it is allowed, destroys the soul union between husband and wife, so it
   is here. Love must be the motive, or the service is valueless, and the
   oneness is marred. There must be, as Cook says, "similarity of feeling"
   between souls that would be one. Each must desire what the other
   desires, and each must hate what the other hates. And the mutual
   service must spring, not from "I ought to," but "I want to." The little
   word ought which is grand in other relationships, is fatal here. For
   this relationship is of so tender and subtle a nature, that it cannot
   admit of any bondage but the bondage of love. What wife could endure to
   have her husband say to her in the morning as he left home for
   business, "Well, I suppose it is my duty to work for you, and I mean to
   do it faithfully, but it is a very great cross I can assure you, and I
   only do it because I must." Would not a support so legally given be
   rejected with indignation, and would not all hope of any real union
   between that husband and wife be utterly gone?

   But if legality would be fatal in an earthly union, how much more in
   the heavenly. And therefore, before the soul can be "married to
   another, even to Him who is raised from the dead," it must be fully
   "delivered from the law," by being "dead to that wherein it was held,"
   in order that it may "serve in newness of spirit, and not in the
   oldness of the letter." And this is brought about, as was Ruth's
   deliverance from her nearer kinsman, by purchase. Boaz purchased Ruth
   from Mahlon to be his wife, iv. 9, 10; and Christ "hath redeemed us
   from the curse of the law," having "purchased us with His own precious
   blood" that we may be united to Him in a blessed oneness, far nearer
   and dearer than any earthly union could be, but which the earthly one
   most blessedly symbolizes.

   At last of Ruth we read, iv. 13, "So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his
   wife." And of the Church we read, that, "Christ loved the Church and
   gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the
   washing of water by the Word, that He might present it to Himself a
   glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but
   that it should be holy and without blemish," Eph. v. 25-27.

   In the divine order, the son born of this marriage was one in the line
   of the ancestors of our Lord. "And Salmon begat Boaz of Rachab; and
   Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; and Jesse begat David
   the king," Matt. i. 5. And thus the poor Gentile widow, who had gone to
   put her trust under the wings of the God of Israel, ii. 12, found rest
   there, and a bridegroom, and a home, and was exalted to a place of
   especial honor. Surely before she went, it had not entered into her
   heart to conceive of the things God had in store for her, any more than
   it has entered into our hearts. And if we, who like Ruth, are a "wild
   olive tree," find ourselves grafted in among the branches and with them
   partaking of the "root and fatness of the olive tree," there is surely
   no room for boasting on our part, except as our souls shall "make their
   boast in the Lord," and shall say with Ruth, "Why have I found grace in
   thine eyes, that thou shouldst take knowledge of me, seeing that I am a
   stranger?"

   The practical lesson to be drawn from this little book would seem to be
   this, that, should there be in the experience of any the sad failure
   typified in Judges, the remedy for it is to be found, not in going back
   into the wilderness, nor, much less, in going back into Egypt, but in
   coming into a nearer and deeper union with Christ, such a union as is
   set before us in the words of our Lord in John xvii. 22, 23: "And the
   glory which Thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one even
   as we are one: I in them and Thou in me, that they may be made perfect
   in one: and that the world may know that Thou hast sent me, and hast
   loved them as Thou hast loved me."

   The promise is ours. Let us boldly make our claim, and then "sit still"
   until we know "how the matter will fall;" for we may rest assured our
   Lord will not be in rest, until He has perfected that which concerns
   us. He has made our souls capable of a marvelous oneness with Himself,
   and has removed every barrier. But He will not force it upon us. A
   compelled marriage can never be other than a wretched one; and the
   glory of our destiny is, that, on our part, it is to be a voluntary and
   glad surrender to a love that woos and wins our hearts by its sweet
   constraint. We love Him because He first loved us, and we can come to
   Him with unshrinking faith to claim that which He Himself has already
   told us is His own purpose and prayer. "That they may be one" -- it is
   all shut up in this. One with the Father as the Son is one! Similarity
   of thought, of feeling, of desire, of loves, of hates. We may have it
   all, dear Christian, if we are but willing. We may walk through this
   world, so united to Christ, that our cares and our interests, our
   sorrows and our joys, our purposes and our wishes will be the same. One
   will alone to govern us, one mind to control us. He in us and we in
   Him; until so intermingled and conjoined will be our lives, that we can
   say at last in very truth, always and everywhere, "Not I, but Christ."
   For self will vanish in such a union as this, and this great "I" of
   ours, which so fills up the present horizon, will wilt down into
   nothing before the glory of His overcoming presence.

   Seek after this oneness then, with all thy heart, dear reader. Thy Lord
   intends it for thee, and will grant it, as soon as He has prepared thy
   soul to enter into it. Let nothing discourage thee. Though He tarry,
   wait for Him, for He will surely come and will not tarry; and if thou
   wilt but persevere, the blessed day must and will come, sooner or
   later, when thy soul shall be satisfied with the fullness of His love,
   and thou shalt abide continually in His conscious presence. He will
   come and take up His abode with thee, and, like Ruth, thou shalt "find
   rest" at last in the hear of thy Heavenly Bridegroom.

  THAT KINGDOM WHICH IS AFTER THE COMMANDMENTS AND TRADITIONS OF MEN.

  Keynote: Mark vii. 9.

   THE six books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles may all be considered as
   only different chapters of one book, for they all give us the story of
   Israel during the period of its being a kingdom. They are, I think,
   typical of that "kingdom of heaven" which exists now upon the earth,
   outwardly in the Church in all its branches, and inwardly in the heart
   of every child of God.

   The keynote to these books is to be found in the New Testament passages
   concerning the "kingdom of God" or the "kingdom of Heaven;" which occur
   over one hundred times there. And the title I would suggest would be,
   "The kingdom of God both inward and outward." In these books we have
   given to us, as it seems to me, types or pictures of different forms
   under which His kingdom is set up in the Church outwardly, and inwardly
   in the hearts of believers. We are shown here the sorts of rule which
   are acceptable to Him, and those which displease Him. We are shown the
   privileges and glory of the kingdom, when rightly governed by the
   Prince of Peace, and the dangers and disgrace that result from a
   divided rule.

   There are four of these pictures. The first gives us the kingdom under
   Saul, with the causes that led to it; the second the kingdom under
   David; the third the kingdom under Solomon; and the fourth the failure
   and division of the kingdom, and its gradual declension down to the
   Babylonish captivity.

   The story of Saul is to be found in the first book of Samuel, and the
   character of rule which he seems to represent, is that rule which is
   according to the commandments and traditions of men. The Divine comment
   on his character was simply this, "He inquired not of the Lord:
   therefore He slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of
   Jesse," 1 Chron. x. 14. During all his reign the Ark of God, which was
   the only Divine dwelling-place in all the land of Israel, remained in
   obscurity at Kirjath-jearim, and David declares in 1 Chron. xiii. 3
   that they "inquired not at it in the days of Saul." Saul preferred his
   own thoughts and his own ways, to the thoughts and ways of the Lord;
   and therefore we read in 1 Chron. x. 13: "So Saul died for his
   transgression which he committed against the Lord, even against the
   word of the Lord, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one
   that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it." In all this he was a
   striking type of that rule which obtains in so many Christian churches
   and Christian lives, where man, rather than God, is consulted and
   obeyed.

   The causes which led Israel to desire a king are given to us in the
   first eight chapters of 1 Samuel. The first cause was the failure of
   the priests; see ii. 22-36. I have stated previously that the priests
   seem to me to be a type of a soul in communion; and the failure of the
   priesthood, therefore, would represent the failure of the soul's
   communion with the Lord. The result of this failure was the loss of the
   Ark of God, which was taken by the Philistines and carried away to
   their own country, and set up in the house of their god Dagon, iv. 17,
   v. 1, 2. The Ark was the Lord's dwelling-place in the midst of His
   people, where He continually manifested His presence and revealed His
   will. "For there," He had said in Ex. xxv. 22, "I will meet with thee,
   and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, between the two
   cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I
   will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel." Nowhere
   else in Israel was this communion possible; and when the Ark was gone
   from their midst, Israel was shut out from their Lord. The loss of the
   Ark therefore was a striking type of the soul's loss of communion.

   The conscious indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and His blessed teaching
   and guiding are no longer realized by the soul that, through
   unfaithfulness, has suffered this saddest of all losses; and Ichabod,
   or "there is no glory," is the grievous realization of such now, as
   truly as it was of Israel then, as we read in chap. iv. 22: "And she
   said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the Ark of God is taken."

   The priesthood having failed, and the Ark being thus carried captive,
   the Lord raised up a prophet to supply their place. "And the word of
   the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision." "And
   all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was established to
   be a prophet of the Lord. And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh: for
   the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh, by the word of the
   Lord," 1 Sam. iii. 1, 20, 21.

   For a while this was partially effectual. The Ark was restored, not
   indeed to its rightful place in Shiloh, but to Kirjath-jearim, a place
   within the borders of Israel, 1 Sam. vi.,vii.; and the Philistines, who
   had oppressed the Israelites, were subdued, and "came no more into the
   coast of Israel; and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines
   all the days of Samuel. And the cities which the Philistines had taken
   from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the
   coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines.
   And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites," 1 Sam. vii. 13,
   14. But in Samuel's old age the prophets also failed, for we read that
   "His sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre and
   perverted judgment." And this was the second cause of Israel's desire
   for a king. Immediately they gathered themselves to Samuel and said,
   "Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a
   king to judge us like all the nations," viii. 5.

   When communion fails, teaching comes in to supply its place. Doctrines
   are looked to as the remedy for spiritual coldness and wandering; and
   lost or forgotten truths are revived. The effect at first seems
   blessed, communion seems partially restored, and the soul's enemies are
   for a time subdued. But this communion is only after all on the surface
   or borders of our natures, for truth alone, without the Spirit, can not
   reach the central home of the soul; and sooner or later, therefore,
   teaching also fails.

   I remember a time in my own experience when just this thing happened to
   me. It was before I knew the secret of the life hid with Christ in God,
   and when my soul was crying out continually, "Oh my leanness, my
   leanness!" I found, experimentally, that the learning of new truth
   helped me for a time into greater warmth and earnestness of Christian
   life, and I sought eagerly for every opportunity of being taught. But
   continually I was disappointed by finding that, in a little while, the
   freshness of the new discovery in truth would wear off, and with its
   freshness, its power would seem to go, and my soul would be left drier
   than ever; and yet the only remedy of which I then knew, was to go on
   learning more new truth, hoping that at last I should discover
   something whose effects would be permanent, and from which there would
   be no reaction. But this can never be. It takes an experience far
   deeper than the learning of new truth alone to keep the soul alive; and
   the result of repeated disappointments, unless a more vital experience
   is known, is to drive the soul into seeking by some outward rule to
   supply the empty place from which the Lord is lost. The "commandments
   and traditions of men" take the place of the "commandment of God;" and
   the soul endeavors by the "law of a carnal commandment" to remedy the
   state, into which it has been brought by the loss of inward communion,
   and by the consequent lack of spiritual power to restore, in even the
   clearest teaching of truth.

   This desire of Israel for a king was displeasing to the Lord, because
   it was a token that they had rejected Him, that He "should not reign
   over them." And He warned them faithfully of the results that would
   certainly follow any rule but his own: "This will be the manner of the
   king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint
   them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some
   shall run before his chariots. And he will appoint him captains over
   thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his
   ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war,
   and instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be
   confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take
   your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive-yards, even the best of
   them, and give them to his servants. And he will take the tenth of your
   seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his
   servants. And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants,
   and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.
   He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants," 1
   Sam. viii . 11-17; see also xii. 17-19.

   This whole passage seems to me a striking picture of that which happens
   to every soul that yields itself up to be governed by the "commandments
   and traditions of men." The best of its strength is taken in this
   service, and all its powers are in bondage to its control. Time, and
   talents, and money, and influence are all used to establish and support
   some system of doctrine, or some form of worship, and the "goodliest"
   of our powers are put to their work. And all the while the Lord is
   saying to such a soul, as He did to the Pharisees of old, "In vain do
   they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men," Matt.
   xv. 2-9.

   The Israelites were not influenced by Samuel's warning, for we read:
   "Nevertheless, the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they
   said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; that we also may be like
   all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us,
   and fight our battles," 1 Sam. viii. 19, 20.

   "Like all the nations;" these words contain the secret of the power of
   the "commandments and traditions of men." The soul shrinks from the
   thought of a walk alone with an unseen God, guided only by His Spirit,
   and prefers to follow in the footsteps of the forefathers, and to walk
   "according to the tradition of the elders." And I would that, just
   here, the solemn question should come home to each one of us, as to
   whether in our own experience there is anything similar to this failure
   of the children of Israel. Are there any of my readers who are seeking,
   by an outward rule of the commandments and traditions of men, to remedy
   a state into which they have been brought by the loss of their inward
   communion, and the failure of outward teaching to supply its place? Are
   there any whose first and ruling thought is not, What has the Lord
   commanded? but, What does my church say? or, What do my friends
   believe? or, What has been the custom of my forefathers? For if this is
   a faithful description of any, the Lord's rebuke to such is like His
   rebuke to Israel, "Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye
   may keep your own tradition," Mark. vii. 9.

   The Lord's warning having failed, He consents that they shall have a
   king according to their request, but His comment upon it all is to be
   found in Hos. xiii. 10, 11, "Thou saidst, Give me a king and princes. I
   gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath;" see
   xii. 16-22. As it was in the wilderness, so it was now, "He gave them
   their request, but sent leanness into their souls," Ps. cvi. 15.

   The first king, Saul, was chosen because of his strength. To the eye of
   flesh he looked like a king upon whom they could lean with confidence;
   "from his shoulders and upwards he was higher than any of the people,"
   x. 2. But he had one sad weakness, which yet however looked like
   strength. He depended upon his own resources and his own understanding,
   rather than upon a present though unseen God. "When Saul saw any strong
   man, or any valiant man, lie took him unto him," xiv. 52. And he
   "gathered an host" whenever he went out to battle. Moreover, he
   "inquired not of the Lord" concerning his course of action, nor did he
   even obey the Lord's voice when it had been made known to him. When the
   coming of the prophet was delayed, for whom he had been commanded to
   wait, he "forced himself and offered sacrifices, which he had no right
   to offer, from motives of expediency, lest, as he said, "the
   Philistines should come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made
   supplication unto the Lord," xiii. 8-12. His own apprehensions of what
   was expedient were always his guide. The command of the Lord concerning
   the Amalekites was, "Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all
   that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant
   and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass," xv. 1-3. Nothing could have
   been plainer. But it seemed best to Saul that some of them should be
   spared, and we read in verse 9, "But Saul and the people spared Agag,
   and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and
   the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them:
   but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly."
   It also seemed best to him to destroy the Gibeonites, although Israel
   had given them a pledge for their preservation, for "the children of
   Israel had sworn unto them, and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal."
   Comp. Joshua ix. and 2 Sam. xxi. 1-14. His "zeal" seemed ever to lead
   him in opposition to the will of the Lord, as we too often see among
   Christians now, who, from motives of expediency, spare what the Lord
   has condemned to destruction, or destroy what He would keep alive. Or
   they outrun their Guide, as Saul did at Gilgal; and often from the same
   motive, because they "fear the people and obey their voice" rather than
   the voice of the Lord, xv. 3-22. And yet, though Saul could so
   disregard the commandments of the Lord, whenever it seemed best for him
   to do so, he was very rigorous in insisting upon obedience to his own
   commands. As we see in chap. xiv., when he "troubled the land" by an
   unreasonable requirement that they should not taste food on the day
   when they were pursuing their enemies; and thus caused them to sin in
   eating meat with the blood, at the day's end, when "very faint with
   hunger." Moreover, he was ready to kill Jonathan, his son, for having
   in utter ignorance disobeyed his unreasonable command, xiv. 24, 45.

   Such was Saul, the king after man's own heart, whom Israel had put in
   God's place. And he stands, I believe, as a type of all rule which is
   purely vicarial; that is, a rule which does not act for the Lord, but
   instead of Him. Such a rule involves the idea of an absent and
   forgetful Lord.

   Andrew Jukes, in his book called the "Mystery of the Kingdom," says
   concerning this: "Of such rule we have the most perfect expression in
   the Church of Rome.  . . . But in principle it exists wherever
   ministerial rule of any kind is claimed or recognized as vicarial.  . .
   . Such rule may be known by its acts and fruits, not by its words. Like
   Saul, standing in the strength of gift, rather than in the strength of
   God the Giver, it will ever choose seen things and strong things to
   serve Israel. It can see and own God's gifts; it cannot own Himself.  .
   . . Zealous for gift, it denies grace; it denies God, that which He
   most asks for, a place among men, as Himself, beyond and above all His
   gifts, their one sufficient portion. And vicarial rule, as it puts God
   out of, so it puts man into His place. Under it the Church, as Israel
   in Saul's case, is brought into bondage. Indeed, it has become a
   proverb that spiritual dominion, or what is commonly recognized as
   such, is generally a spirit of domination; that it has a disposition to
   enslave, and imposes a heavy yoke, not only on men's bodies, but on
   their minds. The Church of Rome, in which the fullest manifestation of
   vicarial rule has as yet been seen, is proof enough of this. Like Saul,
   it makes rules far beyond the word of God; and then, as Saul, judges
   those like Jonathan, whose faith leads them, beyond or without rule, to
   deliver Israel.  . . . One word more respecting vicarial rule. Saul did
   not assume his place. It was given him according to Israel's wish. So
   has it been with Antichristian rule in the place of Christ. Ministers
   do not seize this place; it is ever yielded them by the people. Pastors
   have not so much arrogated it, as the flock have sought it. It is but
   the old story over again of Moses in the mount. The mediator is out of
   sight, in God's presence for Israel. Then the cry is, 'Give us gods to
   go before us.' Out of communion, man wants and will have something seen
   and tangible, to put in the place of an unseen and distrusted God."

   The result of all this in Saul's case was, that God's sentence was
   pronounced against him, first in chap. xiii. 13, 14. "But now thy
   kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought a man after His own
   heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain over His people,
   because thou hast not kept that which the Lord commanded thee," 1 Sam.
   xiii. 14. And again, in chap. xv. 21, 23, 28, "And Samuel said, Hath
   the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in
   obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better then
   sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the
   sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.
   Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, He hath also rejected
   thee from being king." "The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from
   thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbor of thine who is better
   than thou."

   And similarly will the Lord deal with the Church, or the individual
   soul now, when the rule to which they have submitted themselves leads
   them contrary to His will. The government must be rent from all such,
   and be laid upon the shoulders of the true David, who is indeed a king
   "after God's own heart." And that rule, which is after the commandments
   and traditions of men must, sooner or later, by an immediate surrender,
   or by slow degrees, and through many conflicts, pass out of our lives,
   or Christ alone can never reign the victorious Lord of all.

CHAPTER XII.

II SAMUEL AND I CHRONICLES.

  THE REIGN OF DAVID.

  THE KINGDOM OF GOD BOTH INWARD AND OUTWARD.

  Keynote: Luke xvii. 20, 21.

   AND the Lord said unto Samuel, how long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
   seeing that I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine
   horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for
   I have provided me a king among his sons."

   Immediately following the rejection of Saul in 1 Sam. xv., we come in
   chap. xvi, to the anointing of David. The desired king had failed to
   deliver, and the Lord, who is rich in grace, now meets Israel on their
   own ground, and out of evil brings forth good. They had asked for a
   king in their folly and wickedness, and the Lord, having administered
   the needed reproof and chastisement turns this very sinful desire into
   a means of richest blessing. He chooses a king for them who shall be
   after His own heart, and who shall lead them on to hitherto undreamed
   of triumphs. For we must not suppose that rule in itself is opposed to
   God. On the contrary, we are taught everywhere throughout the
   Scriptures the lesson of submission to the Lord, and to that which is
   according to His mind. Even if we submit to earthly authorities, it
   must always be "in the Lord." And while there must not be vicarial
   rules governing instead of the Lord, there must always be that rule
   which witnesses to His presence in the midst of His people, guiding and
   controlling them Himself personally, even though He may make known His
   will through the mouths of His servants.

   David is an exemplification of this sort of rule. He governed Israel
   only as a witness of the Lord's abiding presence. He was not the Lord's
   vicar, but the Lord's instrument. And therefore his language always
   was: "For the kingdom is the Lord's; and He is the governor among the
   nations."

   To my mind this bestowal upon Israel of a king after the lord's own
   heart, is a most blessed illustration of the truth of that word that
   "all things work together for good to them that love God." Al1 things
   -- even our very mistakes and failures. Earthly parents seek to do this
   in their limited measures, striving always to make every failure of
   their children a stepping-stone to the acquirement of some greater good
   or some deeper lesson, which could not have come perhaps in any other
   way; and surely far more will our Heavenly Father, whose wisdom and
   power are limitless, do the same. Therefore we may come to Him in happy
   confidence, with all our tangled skeins and ruined lives, and trust Him
   to pick them up just where we give them to Him, and to make all things
   work together for our final good.

   The king after God's own heart did not, however, at once upon his
   anointing, gain the supremacy. For many years he was a fugitive in the
   very country of which he was the rightful king, hunted, as he himself
   says, like "a partridge in the mountains," xxii. 20. And in this he is
   a wonderful type of the true David, our Lord Jesus Christ, who lived in
   the world which belonged to Him, as a fugitive and an outcast, with no
   place even "wherein to lay His head." In fact, all through the Bible,
   David is used continually as a type of our Lord, and even as His
   mouth-piece, as we see in the Psalms; and we are warranted therefore in
   expecting to learn from the story of his life many wonderful lessons
   concerning his great Antitype. I cannot go into all the details of
   these. But the one especial lesson I desire to bring out here, is, that
   in reference to Christ as Head over His kingdom, and His ways as our
   King, both in the inward and the outward kingdom. We see Him in type
   here as the "Captain of our salvation," leading us on to victory, and
   "delivering us out of the hand of our enemies," and causing us to be
   "more than conquerors" through His mighty power.

   David reigned to conquer Israel's enemies. In 2 Sam. iii. 18 we read,
   "For the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant
   David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines,
   and out of the hand of all their enemies." And Jesus also became our
   King "that we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of
   all that hate us," Luke i. 71. At the close of his reign David could
   say, "Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath He not given you rest
   on every side? For He hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine
   hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord and His people," 1 Chron.
   xxii. 18. And Jesus also said, "Be of good cheer: I have overcome the
   world." "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the
   world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither
   let it be afraid."

   The very followers David had during this time of his rejection, are
   wonderfully typical of the followers of the Lord Jesus now. "Every one
   that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one
   that was discontented gathered themselves unto him," xxii. 1, 2. And of
   our Lord we read, that "He came unto His own, but His own received Him
   not;" and that those who did receive Him were, like David's followers,
   the poor, and the unhappy, and the sinful. For we read that the "common
   people heard him gladly," and that "the publicans and the harlots went
   into the kingdom of God" before the religious men of that day.
   Moreover, the Pharisees and the Scribes murmured concerning Him,
   saying, "This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them," Luke xv. 2.

   Throughout the whole book of 1 Samuel from chap. xvi. onward, the
   conflict between Saul and David went on, a striking picture of the
   convict between the two sorts of rule in the heart of the believer, on
   the one side the commandments of men, and on the other God's anointed
   King. And well will it be for us, if, during this conflict, whether it
   be long or short, the language can be used concerning us, as was used
   in this case, "Now there was long war between the house of Saul, and
   the house of David; but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the
   house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker," 2 Sam. iii. 1. In such a
   conflict as this, the end, even though long delayed through our
   unfaithfulness, is sure to come, and the day will at last dawn for us
   as for Israel, when every power in our nature will acknowledge the
   supremacy of our King, and when with our whole being we will crown Him
   Lord of all. This blessed consummation came to Israel in 2 Samuel after
   the death of Saul. "Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto
   Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. Also
   in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out
   and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord said to thee, Thou shalt feed my
   people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. So all the
   elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a
   league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they anointed David
   king over Israel," 2 Sam. v. 1-3.

   The books of 2 Samuel and 1 Chronicles are taken up with the story of
   David's reign. They are full of deeply interesting incidents bringing
   out much valuable typical teaching, but it is not within the scope of
   these lessons to go into the details of this. It is enough for my
   purpose to consider the grand outlines of David's kingship over his
   people, and the blessings he brought them. His first introduction to us
   in 1 Sam. xvi. 1, and xvii. 34, 35, as a shepherd keeping his sheep,
   and risking his own life to rescue one little helpless lamb that had
   been seized by a lion, show us the sort of king he was likely to be;
   caring for his people more than for himself, and fulfilling at any cost
   to himself the duties of ownership and control. And surely in this he
   sets forth, though but faintly indeed, the character of our King, the
   Lord Jesus, who is also the "Good Shepherd giving His life for the
   sheep;" and who leaves the ninety and nine that have never gone astray,
   in order to rescue and save the one that was lost. "And I will set up
   one Shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David;
   he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd," Ezek. xxxiv. 23.

   A shepherd and a king seem widely separated in rank, and yet, if we but
   understand it, their duties are the same, and their responsibilities
   are alike. Each is bound to care for, and protect, and bless to the
   utmost limit of his ability, those who are under his control; and no
   man is fit to be a king who is not a shepherd as well. Christians are
   accustomed to looking so exclusively on their side of the question,
   their duties and their responsibilities, that they lose sight almost
   altogether of God's side, and thus miss a vast amount of comfort. The
   responsibilities of an owner, and much more of a Creator, are greater
   than can be expressed. Parents feel something of this, and by a
   universal instinct, which is inalienable in our natures, all parents
   are held responsible within certain limitations, to their own
   consciences and to their fellow-men, for the well doing and prosperity
   of their children. In the same way owners of animals, or owners of
   property, or owners of anything, are bound to care for, and protect,
   and watch over that which they own, and are held responsible to repair
   if possible the damages which come to their possessions. Even children
   feel this sense of responsibility, and will go, perhaps reluctantly, to
   feed a bird because it is theirs, and rejoice in being released from
   that duty, because their property has been transferred to another
   owner. The position of authority and ownership, therefore, brings
   responsibility, and a king is bound to care for his subjects. Surely
   the subjects may take the comfort of this, and may rest their souls, in
   a glad deliverance from every anxiety, when under the care of a wise
   and loving Ruler. To my own mind there is immense comfort to be found
   in this thought. Our King is also our Owner. For, says the apostle, "Ye
   are not your own, but ye are bought with a price." Therefore we may
   safely leave the care and management of everything that concerns us, to
   Him, who has Himself enunciated as an inexorable law that "if any man
   provide not for his own, he hath denied the faith and is worse than an
   infidel." I feel sure, therefore, that it was not without significance
   that the Lord took David "from the sheepfolds, and brought him to feed
   His people and Israel His inheritance." He surely meant, I doubt not,
   to make him a type of that future King, whose control is and can be
   nothing but blessing to His people, because He is also their Shepherd
   and "careth for His sheep." I would that every one could realize the
   blessedness of this thought. For I feel sure that if they did, there
   would be no longer any delay in their surrender to this glorious
   Shepherd King; but like it was in Israel's case as related in I Chron.
   xii., there would come to our David "day by day to help Him," until
   there would be "a great host, like the host of God," saying, "Thine are
   we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse." And there would be then
   indeed among us, as among them of old, "joy in Israel." For there are
   but few joys like the joy of entire surrender to the Lord Jesus Christ.
   The soul that has tried it knows this, and to the soul that has not, I
   can only say that the control of unselfish love is always lovely, even
   when that love is earthly, because in the nature of things love can
   choose only the best for its beloved one, and must pour out itself to
   the last drop to help and to bless that one; and that therefore the
   control of God, who is love; who is not merely loving, but is Love
   itself, must be and can be nothing but infinite and fathomless
   blessing.

   I shall never forget a scene in my past life when I first fully
   realized this blessed kingship of the Lord Jesus Christ. It was in a
   great open air meeting, which, accounting for the difference in time,
   was held just at the hour when the infallibility of the pope was being
   proclaimed in Rome; and one of the preachers present stepped forward on
   the platform and proposed, that, while this was going on in Rome, and
   the pope was being crowned with a new and blasphemous honor, we there
   should rise and crown Jesus Lord of all, by singing the well-known hymn
   beginning, "All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name." In an instant, the
   thousands present were on their feet, singing it with a burst of
   loyalty and enthusiasm that seemed almost to carry us away. And over
   and over we sang that hymn, with a meaning it never had to us before,
   while hundreds of hearts did then and there crown "Jesus Lord of all"
   in their whole being, as they had not until this moment dreamed it
   could be done. It was a never-to-be-forgotten hour, and many have been
   the testimonies that have come to me since, of the lasting and blessed
   results that have come into the lives that at that moment took Jesus to
   be their King. Come then, dear readers, as Israel did, "with a perfect
   heart," and make the Lord Jesus King over all that you are and all that
   you have. Let the "government be upon His shoulders," and rejoice in
   the blessed promise that "of the increase of His government and peace
   there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom,
   to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
   henceforth even for ever."

   As far as appears, David led his people on to continuous victory, and
   the secret of it was his childlike dependence upon the Lord. Every step
   of the way he testified continually to his own weakness, and to God's
   strength. Over and over we have the expression used concerning him,
   "and the Lord was with him." When confronted with the giant he said to
   Saul, who told him he was not able to fight the Philistine, "The Lord
   that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the
   bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine." And to
   the giant himself he said, "Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a
   spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of
   hosts, the God of the armies of Israel whom thou hast defied. This day
   will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee and
   take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of
   the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild
   beasts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a God in
   Israel. And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with
   sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's, and He will give you
   into our hands," 1 Sam. xvii. 45-47.

   In everything David saw a present God. Unlike Saul, of whom it was said
   that he "inquired not of the Lord," we find David continually in every
   time of need going to the Lord for advice and guidance. "And David
   inquired of the Lord, saying, "Shall I go up and smite these
   Philistines?" "Will the men of Keilah deliver me up?" "Wilt thou
   deliver the Philistines into mine hand?" "Shall I pursue after this
   troop?" "Shall I overtake them?" And the Lord always answered these
   inquiries as simply as they were asked, "Go, and smite these
   Philistines." "The men of Keilah will deliver thee up." "I will
   doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand." "Pursue: for thou
   shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all." See 1 Sam.
   xxiii. 2, 4, 10, 11, 12; xxx. 8; 2 Sam. ii. 1; v. 19, 23; xxi. 1; 1
   Chron. xiv. 10, 14. The simplicity and directness of this intercourse
   and communion between David and the Lord his God, is very striking, and
   reveals a most blessed oneness. In a faint way it prefigures the human
   life of dependence and obedience of our Lord Jesus Christ, and teaches
   us our own privileges of a direct and personal intercourse with our
   Father, who has told us "in everything to make our requests known unto
   Him"; and who surely must mean to grant us as sure a response as He did
   to David. Let us then in everything "inquire of the Lord" with
   childlike confidence, believing that He hears us, and expecting a
   certain reply.

   Even when David failed, he "encouraged Himself in the Lord his God," 1
   Sam. xxx. 6, and at once looked to Him for a deliverance from the
   consequences of his failure. Everywhere and always, he seems to have
   been on terms of such blessed intimacy and oneness with the Lord, that
   nothing could come between to break it. No wonder that God called him a
   man after His own heart; for such utter confidence in His love, and
   submission to His will, could not but please Him.

   One of David's first acts after his establishment upon the throne of
   the kingdom, was to bring up the Ark of God from Kirjath-jearim into
   its rightful place in Jerusalem, Israel's central city; the "city of
   David" as it was called, because it was his presence there that made it
   the "throne of the Lord" for Israel. During Samuel's rule, the Ark of
   the Lord had been rescued from the hands of the Philistines, and had
   been brought as far as Kirjath-jearim, 1 Sam. vii. 1, 2, but had been
   left there, with no tabernacle for it to dwell in, and had been brought
   into "the house of Abinadab in the hill," the only man who seems not to
   have been afraid of its presence; and who is therefore surely a type of
   some hidden faithful Christians now, who, in a time of general
   coldness, yet retain in their own hearts the Lord's conscious presence.
   The ark remained in the house of Abinadab twenty years, and during all
   the reign of Saul it seems to have been utterly neglected, for we see
   no mention made of it, and are told in 1 Chron. xiii. 3 that they
   "inquired not at it in the days of Saul." As soon, however, as David
   was firmly established on his throne, the story of which is given us in
   1 Chron. xii., we read in chapter xiii. that he "consulted with the
   captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader," and said
   "unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you and that
   it be of the Lord our God," . . . "let us bring again the ark of our
   God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul; and all the
   congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the
   eyes of all the people," 1-4. Chaps. xiii., xv., xvi. give us the
   account of this restoration. Because of ignorance of the Lord's ways.
   some difficulties were experienced in the restoration, and there was a
   delay of three months, during which the ark again found refuge in the
   house of one faithful Israelite, Obed-edom the Gittite, whom the Lord
   "blessed with all his household, because of the Ark of God," 2 Sam. vi.
   11, 12. 1 Chron. xiii. 9-14. But David finally "prepared a place, and
   pitched for it a tent," and having learned how to seek the Lord after
   the due order, he "gathered all Israel together" and said, "None ought
   to carry the ark of God but the Levites; for them hath the Lord chosen
   to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto Him forever." And he said
   unto the priests and Levites, "Ye are the chief of the fathers of the
   Levites; sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may
   bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have
   prepared for it. For because ye did it not at the first, the Lord our
   God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
   order. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up
   the ark of the Lord God of Israel. . . . So David, and the elders of
   Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of
   the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obed-edom with joy. So
   they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that
   David had pitched for it: and they covered burnt sacrifices and peace
   offerings before God. And when David had made an end of offering the
   burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
   name of the Lord. And he dealt to every one of Israel, both men and
   women, to every one a loaf of bread, and a great piece of flesh and a
   flagon of wine." And we read that there was joy and gladness, and that
   "on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord into
   the hand of Asaph and his brethren. Give thanks unto the Lord, call
   upon His name, make known His deeds among the people." 1 Chron. xv.
   xvi.

   As the ark was the only dwelling-place of the Lord in the land of
   Israel, where His presence was consciously known, all this seems to me
   to be a type of that restoration to the soul of the believer, of the
   conscious presence of the abiding Comforter, which will always be one
   of the first results of the establishment of Christ's rule in the
   heart. And the joy which accompanied this in Israel's case, as also the
   feeding of the people with bread and meat, and wine, are surely
   symbolical of the joy of restored communion, and the feeding upon
   Christ which it always brings. Henceforth, as we have seen, throughout
   the whole of David's reign they "continually inquired of the Lord"
   about everything. And I believe that only those souls where Christ
   consciously dwells can literally in everything "make their requests
   known unto God."

   Having established the ark in its proper place, as it were, in the
   heart of the nation, David next turned his attention to the nation's
   enemies. "Now after this it came to pass that David smote the
   Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the
   hands of the Philistines," 1 Chron. xviii. 1. Also "he smote Moab, and
   Hadazezer, and the Syrians, and the Edomites, and the children of
   Ammon, and the giants, and the Lord preserved David whithersoever he
   went," see 2 Sam. v., viii., x., xviii., and xxi.; also 1 Chron.
   xviii.-xx., for the account of his battles and victories.

   David was in fact made king for this very purpose; for the Lord had
   spoken concerning him saying, "By the hand of my servant David I will
   save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of
   the hand of all their enemies," 2 Sam. iii. 18. And of our Lord also it
   is said that He was sent in order "that we being delivered out of the
   hands of our enemies, might serve Him without fear in holiness and
   righteousness before Him, all the days of our life," Luke i. 74, 75. As
   far as appears, David was always victorious, and at last he could say
   in that wonderful song which he "spake unto the Lord" "in the day that
   the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies," "I have
   pursued mine enemies and destroyed them; and turned not again until I
   had consumed them." "For thou hast girded me with strength to battle;
   them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. Thou hast also
   given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate
   me," 2 Sam. xxii. 38, 40, 41. And in all this he was, as I have said, a
   type of Christ as our conquering King and Captain, leading up on to
   continual victory.

   But although thus victorious, David's whole reign seems to have been a
   time of conflict. So much so was this the case, that when he wanted to
   build a House for the Lord to dwell in, the word of the Lord came to
   him saying, "Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars:
   thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much
   blood upon the earth," 1 Chron. xxii. 8, xxviii. 3. Only in the reign
   of peace, could this temple be built, and therefore David, the man of
   war, was compelled to leave this work to Solomon, the prince of peace.
   And it was not until the end of his reign, as he handed over his
   kingdom to Solomon, that he could say, "The land is subdued before the
   lord and before His people," 1 Chron. xxii. 18. Experimentally,
   therefore, the kingdom of David was a type of that stage in the soul's
   history, when only conflict is known, and when Christ is apprehended
   only in His character as our conquering Captain, leading us on to
   battle. Many souls know no other Christian life but this, and live
   therefore in perpetual convict. But David's battles were for the
   purpose of conquering Israel's enemies, and when he had accomplished
   this purpose, he handed over into Solomon's control a kingdom which had
   "rest from its enemies all round about." And Christ as our Captain also
   meets and conquers our enemies for us, in order that He may hand over
   the inward kingdom, thus made peaceful and at rest, into the hands of
   Christ as our Solomon, the Prince of Peace, who giveth "peace always by
   all means." Conflict precedes peace, but conflict, if victorious, will
   always bring peace. And never to pass beyond the experience of conflict
   into the experience of peace, would seem to prove that the soul had not
   apprehended Christ as a victorious Captain, before whom the land should
   be in very truth subdued, and into whose hand all its enemies should be
   delivered. Many Christians stumble here, and never pass beyond the
   reign of David. They cannot believe in the accomplished victories of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, but think they must fight and conquer the foe
   for themselves. They lift up, not the shield of faith against their
   enemies, but the shield of doubt, and are, as a consequence, sorely
   smitten by his fiery darts. But one lesson taught us by this history of
   the kingdom under David, seems to me to be simply this, that we must
   apprehend the Lord Jesus Christ as our conquering King and Captain, in
   such a way as to cause us to put all our battles into His hand to
   fight, and to leave all our enemies to Him to vanquish. He has overcome
   the world by actual conflict. We overcome by faith, 1 John v. 4. The
   fiery darts of the enemy spent their strength on Him. He has furnished
   us with a shield of faith wherewith we can quench them all, Eph. vi.
   16. By faith we can say in very truth, "The land is subdued before the
   Lord and before His people," and can enter into the kingdom of rest and
   peace, which He has obtained for us.

   The story of this peaceful kingdom will be found in our next chapter.
   And I would urge every one, who is travelling with me throughout the
   length and breadth of this land of ours, to pause here, and, before
   turning the page that will introduce them to the reign of Solomon, to
   ask themselves definitely and personally whether the kingdom of peace
   is their kingdom, or whether they are ready at once to enter upon it.
   If not, the way is plain. Crown the Lord Jesus as thy conquering David,
   Lord of all in thy heart and life, from this moment onward, and enter
   by faith into His accomplished victories. "Come unto Me," he says, "and
   I will give you rest." I can give it, for I have won it for you in a
   sore conflict with the enemy. Believe me that he is an already
   conquered foe. Let me deliver you out of his hands. Let my peace reign
   in your hearts, and claim a continual triumph. I have labored, enter ye
   into my labors. For "this is the victory that overcometh the world,
   even your faith;" and "who is he that overcometh the world but he that
   believeth that Jesus is the Son of God."

   Canst thou not hear His voice saying something like this to thee, dear
   soul, and wilt thou not believe Him? If thou wilt, then we may together
   turn our page into the kingdom of peace, and may by faith enter therein
   and dwell there.

CHAPTER XIII.

I AND II KINGS AND II CHRONICLES.

  THE KINGDOM OF PEACE.

  Keynote: Col. iii. 15.

   THE reign of Solomon was a reign of peace. The Lord had said to David,
   "Behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest; and I
   will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall
   be Peaceable, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his
   days." The result of having by faith apprehended Christ as our King and
   Captain, who has fought and conquered our enemies for us, will be rest
   and peace. "For we which have believed do enter into rest." Solomon's
   peaceable kingdom was the result of the victories which David had
   obtained. And our peace is the fruit of Christ's victories. The
   chastisement of our peace was upon Him." His legacy to us is peace,
   "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you." And the declaration
   of the Holy Ghost throughout the whole New Testament Scriptures is
   always this, that the kingdom of God is "righteousness, peace and joy
   in the Holy Ghost."

   In Psalm lxxii., called A Psalm for Solomon, we have a blessed
   picture of this kingdom of peace, which so plainly reaches beyond
   Solomon to the "Greater than Solomon," and His final universal kingdom,
   that it is headed also in our English Bibles with the words, "Messiah's
   reign;" and it gives us a sufficient warrant for taking this story of
   the kingdom under Solomon, as a type of that glorious millennial
   kingdom, when in very truth there shall be a King who shall have
   "dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the
   earth."

   At the close of this lxxii. Psalm we are told that "the prayers of
   David the son of Jesse are ended." All that he had hoped for and
   battled for, was fulfilled in the peaceable reign of his son, and in
   the spirit of prophecy he saw also, in the far future, the glorious
   kingdom, when Christ Himself would see of the travail of His soul and
   be satisfied, and when the need for His intercessions would be ended
   also.

   This millennial kingdom is antedated and begun now, in the hearts of
   all those, who by faith enter into the "rest that remaineth for the
   people of God;" and such may therefore take the lessons of this
   glorious reign, as being lessons and promises to themselves, of
   practical and personal importance now and here.

   One of Solomon's first announcements was a declaration of the peace and
   rest of his kingdom. He said to Hiram, king of Tyre, "The Lord my God
   hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary
   nor evil occurrent," 1 Kings v. 4. And upon the dedication of the
   temple, he again declared it, "Blessed be the Lord, that hath given
   rest unto His people Israel, according to all that He promised; there
   hath not failed one word of all His good promise, which He promised by
   the hand of Moses His servant," 1 Kings viii. 56.

   As a consequence of this rest, his kingdom was one of unexampled
   greatness. Power, wisdom, luxury and magnificence were its
   characteristics. 1 Kings iv. 21-34 describes it. "And Solomon reigned
   over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and
   unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all
   the days of his life. And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty
   measures of fine flour, and three-score measures of meal, ten fat oxen,
   and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, besides
   harts, and roe-bucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl. For he had
   dominion over all the region on this side of the river, from Tiphsah
   even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had
   peace on all sides round about him. And Judah and Israel dwelt safely,
   every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to
   Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon. And Solomon had forty thousand
   stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And
   those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came
   unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.
   Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto
   the places where the officers were, every man according to his charge.
   And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
   largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. And
   Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east
   country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men;
   than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of
   Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. And he spake three
   thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spoke
   of trees, from the cedar- tree that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop
   that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl,
   and of creeping things, and of fishes. And there came of all people to
   hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had
   heard of his wisdom."

   Even the Gentiles, chapter v., emblematic of the world and its
   desirable things, placed themselves and their wealth at the disposal of
   Solomon and helped him, instead of hindering, in all that he undertook.
   And similarly we read concerning Christians, "All things are yours;
   whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death,
   or things present, or things to come; all are yours, and ye are
   Christ's, and Christ is God's," 1 Cor. iii. 21-23.

   The world was attracted by the report of the riches and glory of this
   kingdom, and the Queen of Sheba came from her far country to Jerusalem
   to see if all that had been told her could indeed be true. And we read
   in 1 Kings x. 4-9, that when she had seen "all Solomon's wisdom, and
   the house that he had built, and the meat of his table, and the sitting
   of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their
   apparel, and his cup-bearers, and his ascent by which be went up into
   the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her." And she said
   to the king, "It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy
   acts and of thy wisdom. Howbeit I believed not the words until I came,
   and mine eyes had seen it; and behold, the half was not told me; thy
   wisdom and prosperity exceeded the fame which I heard."

   And in the same way, we may be sure the world will be attracted by the
   report of Christian lives that are filled with spiritual riches, and
   power, and wisdom, and will gather from far and near to see if the
   story they have heard can indeed be a true one; and when they have seen
   it, and have witnessed the peace in the midst of trial, and the inward
   joy overpowering the outward sorrow, and the victory over temptation,
   and the overflowing wealth of grace, they will be forced to acknowledge
   that it is indeed true, that "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
   have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared
   for them that love Him." And thus the saying of our Lord in the sermon
   on the mount will be fulfilled, that our light shall so "shine before
   men," that they, seeing our good works, may "glorify," not us, but "Our
   Father which is in Heaven."

   Dear reader, are these things the characteristics of the kingdom in
   which thou art dwelling now? And is the out- side world so attracted by
   the report of thy riches and thy spiritual power, as to come to thee to
   learn if what they have heard be indeed true, and to discover if
   possible the secret of it? Do thy children see in thee such sweetness
   under provocation, and such patience under trial, as to be won, by the
   power of these, to love and to serve thy God, who does so much for
   thee? Do thy servants, or thy work-people, or thy friends, have cause
   to know from the outward peace of thy daily life, that the God of peace
   reigns within, and are their hearts attracted to His service?

   Alas! I am afraid that the reverse is too often the case, and that one
   great cause of the small number of conversions in a church or a
   community is to be found in the poor and meagre sort of religion that
   exists there; and that far oftener than we think, husbands, or wives,
   or children, are kept outside the fold, by what they see in those
   nearest them, who profess to belong to this fold. I feel sure that if
   we who are Christians, all lived in this kingdom of spiritual peace and
   of abounding spiritual plenty, we should find hundreds flocking to the
   church, where now there is one. How can a husband think it is a
   desirable thing to be a Christian, when he sees his wife with a sort of
   Christianity that seems only to make her uncomfortable and gloomy; or
   how can children be attracted to a religion, which is professed by a
   cross or unreasonable father? A gentleman of learning who was an
   unbeliever, said something to me once, which I have never forgotten. We
   were talking together on the subject of Christianity, and I was urging
   its claims upon him, when he said, with marked emphasis and yet
   sadness, "If you Christians want the outside world to believe in your
   religion, you must have a better kind. Most of you seem to carry your
   religion as a man carries a headache. He does not want to get rid of
   his head, but he is forced to confess that it causes him a great deal
   of discomfort and suffering. You would not I suppose want to give up
   your religion, but you must acknowledge it often makes you mightily
   uncomfortable." It was, alas, too true a criticism to be treated
   lightly, and I inwardly prayed then and there that the Lord would
   enable Christians everywhere, and myself among them, to have a better
   sort of religion than this. A dear old preacher used to say that when
   buyers went to a shop, they wanted a good article, and that sinners
   equally wanted a good religion, if they undertook to get any at all.
   And I believe this is far truer than we know. Let us then seek to
   realize in our own individual experience, each one of us, all the
   fullness of our glorious salvation, that we may attract the world
   around us, by the beauty and blessedness of our lives, to come, taste
   and see that the Lord is good, and that He does indeed fulfill His
   promises.

   But it is not for this reason only that we need to have the reign of
   peace established in our hearts. Solomon's greatest work was the
   building of the temple. In fact he seems to have been raised up
   especially for this purpose. David says concerning him in 1 Chron.
   xxviii. 5, 6 "And of all my sons (for the Lord hath given me many
   sons), He hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
   kingdom of the Lord over Israel. And He said unto me, Solomon thy son,
   he shall build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my
   son, and I will be his Father.  . . . Take heed now; for the Lord hath
   chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong and do it."

   This temple was to be to Israel what the tabernacle had been up to this
   time, the dwelling-place of the Lord in their midst. While they
   travelled, dwelling only in tents, it was necessary that their God
   should travel with them, and dwell also in a "tent and a tabernacle."
   "For," He said, "I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I
   brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and
   from one tabernacle to another. Wheresoever I have walked with all
   Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded
   to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of
   cedars?" 1 Chron. xvii. 1-6, and 2 Sam. vii. 1-13.

   But now that their journeyings were over, and the Israelites were
   settled in their own land, and dwelling in their own houses, we cannot
   be surprised that "as David sat in his house," the thought should arise
   with wonder, "Lo! I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord remaineth under curtains!" Nor that he should "set
   his affections" to a house for his God, and should desire greatly to
   build it.

   The Lord Himself also, through the mouth of David, had recorded His own
   desire for a House to be built for Him to dwell in, "For the Lord hath
   chosen Zion; He hath desired it for His habitation. This is my rest
   forever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it." "This is the hill
   which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it
   forever," Ps. cxxxii. 13, 14; lxviii. 16. And in Deut. xii. 9-11, He
   said to His people through the mouth of Moses, "Ye are not as yet come
   to the rest and to the inheritance, which the Lord your God giveth you.
   But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your
   God giveth you to inherit, and when He giveth you rest from all your
   enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; then there shall be a
   place which the Lord your God shall choose, to cause His name to dwell
   there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your
   burnt-offerings and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the
   peace-offerings of your hand, and your choice vows which ye vow unto
   the Lord. . . . Take heed to thyself, that thou offer not thy
   burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest; but in the place which
   the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy
   burnt-offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee."

   From all these passages we see, that only when Israel were at rest in
   their land, could this temple be built. The Lord could accompany His
   people in a tent throughout all their wanderings, and in all their
   wars, but He could not take up His rest among them, until they had
   first found rest themselves. This is in the very nature of things. The
   mother cannot go to rest at night, until all her little ones are
   securely tucked in their cribs. The shepherd cannot lie down to repose,
   until his flock is safely folded. A king cannot rest from war, until
   his people do. A captain must not secure his own safety, until the last
   of his crew are saved. Here as everywhere, ownership and control have
   their responsibilities. And the Lord Himself says, "For Zion's sake
   will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest,
   until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the
   salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth," Is. lxii. 1.

   The temple, therefore, could not be built in David's reign, because it
   was a reign of conflict, and the Lord can dwell only in a "peaceable
   habitation and a quiet resting place." David must hand the conquered
   kingdom over to Solomon, whose name is Peaceable, before the Lord's
   house could be built, as we read in 1 Chron. xxviii. 7-9. "And David
   said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house
   unto the name of the Lord my God: but the word of the Lord came to me
   saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou
   shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much
   blood upon the earth in my sight. Behold, a son shall be born to thee,
   who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his
   enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give
   peace and quietness to Israel in his days. He shall build an house to
   my name." And after David's death, Solomon sent to Hiram and said,
   "Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto
   the name of the Lord his God, for the wars which were about him on
   every side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet. But
   now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is
   neither adversary nor evil occurrent. And behold, I purpose to build an
   house unto the name of the Lord my God," 1 Kings v. 3, 4.

   The building of the Temple is described to us in 1 Kings vi.-viii.; and
   2 Chron. ii.-vii. It was indeed, as David had declared it must be,
   "exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries,"
   and was made after the pattern that had been given to David "by the
   Spirit," 1 Chron . xxii. 5, 12. When it was finished, Solomon
   "assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes and
   the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel unto Jerusalem, to
   bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David."
   . . . "And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord
   unto His place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place,
   even under the wings of the cherubims," 2 Chron. v. 1-7. The staves, by
   which the ark had been carried through all the wanderings of the
   Israelites, were "drawn out," as a symbol that now at last the Lord had
   entered into His resting-place; and the Priests and Levites were
   appointed to their rightful positions; and then we read, that "it came
   to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound
   to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; and when they lifted up
   their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and
   praised the Lord, saying, For He is good; for His mercy endureth
   forever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of
   the Lord; so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
   the cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God. Then
   said Solomon, The Lord hath said that He would dwell in the thick
   darkness. But I have built an house of habitation for Thee, and a place
   for Thy dwelling forever. . . . . Now, my God, let I beseech Thee,
   Thine eyes be open, and let Thine ears be attent unto the prayer that
   is made in this place. Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into thy
   resting-place, Thou, and the ark of thy strength; let Thy priests, O
   Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and let Thy saints rejoice in
   goodness. . . . Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire
   came down from heaven and consumed the burnt-offering and the
   sacrifices; and the glory of the Lord filled the house. And the priests
   could not enter into the house of the Lord, because the glory of the
   Lord had filled the Lord's house." 2 Chron. v. 13, 14; vi. 1, 2, 40,
   41: vii. 1, 2.

   All this is, I believe, typical of that which took place on the day of
   Pentecost, when the disciples were "all filled with the Holy Ghost."
   And of that, also, which takes place in every believing heart now, when
   it is emptied of self, and the door is opened, and Christ comes in to
   take up His abode there, and ills it with His manifested presence. It
   is a picture, in short, of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. "What, know
   ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which dwelleth
   in you?" "For ye are the temple of the living God, as God hath said, I
   will dwell in them and walk in them." "Know ye not that ye are the
   temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?" 1 Cor. vi.
   19; iii. 16, and 2 Cor. vi. 16.

   This is in a sense true of all Christians, for on the day of Pentecost
   the Holy Ghost came to the Church, "which is the house of God," to
   abide in her midst forever. But in individual experience, the power of
   it is not always known, and each soul needs to come to its own
   Pentecost. The conscious presence of the abiding Comforter is not
   realized by every Christian. All of course must have the Spirit,
   because the new birth is impossible without His presence and power. But
   to some souls, there comes at a certain stage in their progress, a
   wonderful experience, which they seem instinctively to call the baptism
   of the Holy Spirit, and which lifts them up into a region of spiritual
   life that is as far above their former level, as the mountain top is
   above the valley, and from which but few ever descend. This baptism
   does for souls now, just what it did for the disciples on the day of
   Pentecost. It purifies; it transforms; it endues with power from on
   high; it satisfies; it comforts; it inspires; it controls. It bestows
   upon those who receive it, that "well of water springing up into
   everlasting life," for the soul's own comfort, and those "rivers of
   living water" flowing out for the blessing of others, which our Lord
   promised to all who should believe on Him.

   To some this "promise of the Father" comes as a mighty and overwhelming
   power, so that their very bodies are prostrated under it; to others He
   comes as the tender and gentle presence of love. But whether in one way
   or the other, He always makes His presence manifest; and "at that day,"
   whenever it comes, the words of our Lord which He spoke to His
   disciples concerning this wondrous gift, are invariably fulfilled, "At
   that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in
   you." We may have believed it before, because God says it is so in the
   Scriptures, but then and from thenceforth we know it, by the testimony
   of an inward consciousness, that is unassailable by any form of
   questioning or doubt. The Israelites had believed the Lord was in their
   midst all along in their wanderings, and in their years of bondage,
   even when no sign of His presence was to be seen among them; but now
   that the temple was built, when they all "saw how the fire came down,
   and the glory of the Lord upon the house," they KNEW it; and we cannot
   wonder that at once, without the need of any command from Solomon,
   "they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the
   pavement, and worshipped, and praised the Lord, saying, For He is good;
   for His mercy endureth forever."

   But as the temple could not be built, until the land had rest from its
   enemies all around about, and the reign of peace had begun; so neither
   can the heart know this conscious indwelling of Christ, and this being
   "filled with the Spirit," until it has "entered into rest," and has
   been made more than conqueror through Him. As long as our Christian
   life is only one of conflict, without settled peace of soul, we cannot
   know this experience of being "filled with all the fulness of God." The
   interior life of conscious communion can only exist where peace reigns.
   The Comforter manifests His abiding presence only to those who have
   overcome the world by faith, and whose hearts are at rest. The Lord
   goes with us in all our wanderings, and is beside us in every battle,
   to fight and conquer our enemies for us; but He does not take up His
   abode in our hearts in conscious presence, until the kingdom of peace
   is established there. He cannot. He is the Prince of Peace, and His
   kingdom is and must be always a peaceable kingdom. If therefore we
   would know that experience, which answers to the building of the
   temple, and the Lord coming in to fill it with His glory, we must
   advance beyond the reign of conflict into the reign of peace, and must
   know what it is to have the peace of God which passeth all
   understanding, keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus
   continually.

   And this can be only by faith. The Israelites entered into the
   enjoyment of their peaceable kingdom only by faith. David had conquered
   their enemies, and at the close of his reign he announced this to all
   the princes of Israel, saying, "Is not the Lord your God with you? and
   hath He not given you rest on every side? For He hath given the
   inhabitants of the land into mine hand: and the land is subdued before
   the Lord, and before His people." The princes believed the word of
   David, that it was indeed as he had said, and they at once crowned
   Solomon, whose name means peaceable, to be their king, and began to
   rejoice in the peace of his kingdom. "And they did eat and drink before
   the Lord on that day with great gladness, and they made Solomon the son
   of David, king the second time, and anointed him unto the Lord to be
   the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest. And Solomon sat on the
   throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and all Israel
   obeyed him. And the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
   likewise of king David submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. And
   the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and
   bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before
   him in Israel," 1 Chron. xxix. 22-25.

   Had any of these princes or mighty men doubted the word of David, and
   refused to believe that their enemies were conquered, they might, I
   question not, have continued a skirmishing warfare, and would doubtless
   have hesitated to submit themselves to the reign of the peaceable king.
   But they believed, and consequently they "entered into rest."

   To Christians also is the announcement made by their David, that He has
   met and conquered their enemies for them, and that the land is all
   subdued before Him. "Be of good cheer," He says, "I have overcome the
   world." Not I will overcome it, but I have. "I have finished the work
   which thou gavest me to do." "My peace I leave with you, my peace I
   give unto you." But unless they believe this, and by faith enter into
   the rest which He has conquered for them, they will fail to submit
   themselves to the reign of the Prince of Peace, and will miss of the
   gladness and the royal majesty of His kingdom of peace. Their hearts,
   which were meant to be His temple, and in which He desires to dwell,
   will be closed against His glorious fulness, and the sweetness of His
   conscious and abiding presence will be unknown.

   But, dear friends, this need not be. The promise is sure that He will
   keep that man in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Him, because he
   trusteth in Him. And if we will but trust unceasingly and without any
   reserves, we shall find ourselves dwelling "in a peaceable habitation,
   and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places." Let us crown Him
   then, as our Prince of peace, and let us so utterly submit ourselves
   unto His peaceable control, as that the peace of God shall reign
   unrivalled throughout all our inward kingdom. And then we also, like
   Solomon, can build a house for the Lord, even the temple of our
   surrendered hearts, at the doors of which He is knocking, knocking
   ever, for admittance. "Behold I stand at the door and knock; if any man
   hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with
   him, and he with me," Rev. iii. 20.

   The Lord has always sought for a dwelling-place in His people's midst.
   He loves them with such a yearning love, that He cannot keep away from
   them; and at almost the very first moment of Israel's deliverance out
   of Egypt, His word came to Moses, saying, "Let them make me a
   sanctuary, that I may dwell among them." They had not asked Him to
   come, but He asked them to let Him. He wanted a home amongst them. He
   might have made this home for Himself, by coming in power, and taking
   forcible possession of one of their tents. But this would not have
   satisfied the love that wanted to be a welcomed guest. "Of every man
   that giveth it willingly with his heart, ye shall take my offering" for
   the building of the sanctuary, He had said. And similarly, He will not
   take forcible possession of any heart now, but knocks for admittance.
   "Open to me," He says to each one of us; "Open to me, my sister, my
   love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, my locks
   with the drops of the night," Cant. v. 2 .


   "The wild-fox has his hole,

   The sea-bird has her nest;

   But save in thy surrendered soul

   I have not where to rest."

   Words fail in seeking to tell out the blessedness of this interior life
   of divine union, and the spirit stands amazed before such glorious
   possibilities of experience! With Solomon we exclaim, "But will God in
   very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of
   heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have
   built!" 2 Chron. vi. 18. And the Lord answers, as He did to Solomon "in
   the night," after his prayer of dedication had been made, "I have heard
   thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of
   sacrifice . . . Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto
   the prayer that is made in this place. For now have I chosen and
   sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever; and mine
   eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually," 1 Chron. vii. 12-16.
   "If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will
   and it shall be done unto you." "Hereby know we that we dwell in Him
   and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit." "God is love;
   and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him." "At that
   day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you."
   These are a few of the New Testament expressions of this glorious
   hidden life of conscious union and communion with God.

   My dear reader, is this life thine? It is surely intended for thee, for
   it is declared in Acts ii. 39 that the promise of this wondrous baptism
   is "unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even
   as many as the Lord our God shall call." And it is surely needed by
   thee, for the Christian life without it is but poor and dwarfed, as thy
   soul knoweth right well. Do not be satisfied without it then for even
   so much as another day. The steps to reach it are very simple. First,
   convince thyself from the Scriptures that the baptism of the Spirit is
   a gift intended for thee. Then come to the Lord in simple faith to ask
   for it. Then, having put thy case into His hands, leave it there in
   childlike trust, knowing that He will attend to thy request, and that
   He is more willing to give thee the Holy Spirit than parents are to
   give good gifts to their children. Take 1 John v. 14,15, and act on it.
   "And this is the confidence we have in Him, that, if we ask anything
   according to His will He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us
   whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired
   of Him." Thou art asking for that which is according to His will,
   therefore, thou knowest that He hears thee, and, knowing this, thou
   must know still more, and must believe that thou hast the petitions
   thou desired of Him. By faith claim it as thy present possession. Begin
   to praise Him for His wondrous gift. And it shall come to pass to thee,
   as it did to Israel, that when every power of thy being is as one "to
   make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord," that
   then "the glory of the Lord will fill the house of the Lord," and thy
   hungry soul will be filled and satisfied with His presence.

CHAPTER XIV.

THE DIVIDED KINGDOM.

  Keynote: Matt. vi. 24.

   THE latter part of Solomon's reign, and the divided rule which
   followed, seem to me to be typical of the especial dangers that are
   likely to beset the experience to which we have in that reign advanced,
   and the temptations peculiar to it. No height of spiritual blessing or
   spiritual power, can for a moment absolve us from the need of obedience
   and watchfulness. The temptation to Antinomianism has often overwhelmed
   the Church or the individual, after seasons of peculiar blessing, and
   it needs to be especially guarded against. We can never forsake the
   written law of the Lord with impunity, let our advancement in spiritual
   life be what it may. And we need to watch, lest, when seated in
   heavenly places in Christ, we should feel so far lifted above the usual
   temptations of life, as to be tempted to be less careful of taking heed
   to our steps, that we walk continually in the law of our God. Some have
   grievously failed here.

   And, foreseeing this danger, it was especially commanded concerning the
   king in Deut. xvii. 18-20: "And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the
   throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a
   book out of that which is before the priests the Levites: and it shall
   be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life; that
   he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this
   law and these statutes, to do them: that his heart be not lifted up
   above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to
   the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days
   in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel." Had
   Solomon kept this law before his eyes, he would not have failed as he
   did. And did Christians now faithfully read and obey the teachings of
   the Scriptures, they too would escape similar failures.

   Three especial things had been commanded the king in Deut. xvii. 16,
   17, "But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people
   to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses;
   forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall not henceforth
   return no more that way. Neither shall he multiply wives to himself,
   that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to
   himself silver and gold." Every one of these commands Solomon
   disobeyed. In I Kings x. 26-28 we read that he "gathered together
   chariots and horsemen" and "had horses brought out of Egypt," and that
   he "made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones. And in I Kings xi. 1-8,
   we are further told, that he "loved many strange women" and had "seven
   hundred wives;" and that "it came to pass when Solomon was old that his
   wives turned away his heart after other gods; . . . for he went after
   Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom, the
   abomination of the Ammonites." The result of all this was that the
   "Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the
   Lord God of Israel which had appeared to him twice, and had commanded
   him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods, but
   he kept not that which the Lord commanded. Wherefore the Lord said unto
   Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my
   covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely
   rend the kingdom from thee and give it to thy servant," 1 Kings xi. 10,
   11.

   The three especial dangers, that seem to me to be typically warned
   against in this history are, lest the heart begin to lean on earthly
   resources rather than on the Lord, as symbolized by the horses from
   Egypt; lest it suffer its affections to go out after things the Lord
   has forbidden, as symbolized by the strange wives; and lest it begin to
   store up for its own use and enjoyment the spiritual riches and gifts,
   which have been given for purposes of service to the Lord, as
   symbolized in the multiplying of silver.

   Solomon seemed at first to obtain by these unlawful means, the
   fulfillment of the promises of prosperity made to him; but the fatal
   consequences followed none the less surely. He would have received the
   promises just as certainly, as direct gifts from the hands of the Lord,
   without using these means, and no curse would have followed. But his
   disobedience to the commandments of the Lord, though it at first
   enriched him, soon led to more serious departures, and ended in a
   flagrant turning from the only true God to serve idols. And in our
   case, none the less surely will these consequences follow, if we, like
   Solomon, neglect the Scriptures which are able, we are told, to make
   the man of God perfect, "thoroughly furnished unto all good works;" and
   if we fail to obey the voice of the Lord by His Spirit.

   The result of all this failure was a divided rule. Two kings claimed
   the throne, and ten tribes revolted from the house of David and set up
   Jeroboam, Solomon's servant, as their king, leaving only the tribe of
   Judah to yield allegiance to Rehoboam, Solomon's son. In these two
   kingdoms of Judah and Israel we have presented to us, I think, that
   which always results when the inward kingdom of peace has been lost
   through disobedience, and the heart seeks to serve two masters,
   alternately yielding to the one and then to the other. Our Lord says
   concerning this, "No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate
   the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and
   despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon." Ye cannot. It does
   not say, ye must not, or ye ought not, declaring the penalties that
   will follow if we disobey, but simply, "ye cannot." Joseph Cook says
   that the "cans" and "cannots" of the Bible are not the arbitrary
   expressions of God's will, but are simply divine announcements of the
   eternal nature of things. And we, all of us, know experimentally, that
   any effort to reverse this inexorable "cannot," always results in
   grievous backsliding.

   The kings of Judah, for the most part, seemed to want to serve the true
   God, but they were weakened by the departure of the other tribes, and
   were continually ensnared by Israel's influence or opposition. Of most
   of their kings the divine sentence was of this sort: "He did that which
   was right in the sight of the Lord; but not with a perfect heart." But
   Israel was openly reprobate, and of their kings it was continually
   said, "He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord." Its very
   first king, Jeroboam, fearing the influence of Judah and of the worship
   at Jerusalem, deliberately established idolatry as the legal and
   national worship, and has been from that time known throughout all ages
   as "Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin." "And Jeroboam
   said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David.
   If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at
   Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their
   lord, even unto Rehoboam, king of Judah. Whereupon the king took
   counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too
   much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which
   brought thee out of the land of Egypt. And he set the one in Bethel,
   and the other put he in Dan. And this thing became a sin: for the
   people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan," I Kings, xii.
   26-30. All this, we are told in verse 33, Jeroboam "had devised of his
   own heart." And it seems to me another striking illustration of what
   idolatry really means: that it is that sort of worship which is "after
   the commandments of men," and not of God, and is devised out of our own
   hearts, or out of the hearts of our fathers. In a divided Christian
   soul, such a worship is always set up sooner or later. The heart must
   worship, but it cannot endure the worship of the only true God; "it is
   too much for it," and some substitute is necessary, of the heart's own
   devising.

   I cannot here go into the remaining devils of the books we are
   considering. From the twelfth chapter of 1 Kings, through 2 Kings, and
   from 2 Chron. x. to the end, it is one long and sad story of sin and
   failure. There was constant war between the two kingdoms, alternated
   with occasional alliances. But in these alliances it was not Israel
   that came up to Judah, but Judah who went down to Israel, see 2 Chron.
   xviii. 1, 2. And the consequences of these alliances were such as
   always result from the effort to unite together the service of two
   masters; the idolatrous nation were in the ascendancy, and those who
   were seeking to serve the true God were deceived and betrayed. Great
   disasters fell upon Judah in consequence of this "joining affinity"
   with Israel, and the way was paved for the final fall.

   The lives of the kings of Judah and Israel, and their battles, with
   their alternating victories and defeats, are full of many practical
   lessons for us; but I cannot consider these at present. Neither have I
   space to go into the history of the prophets raised up to preserve a
   faithful testimony to the Lord during this time of grievous failure.
   The books written by many of these prophets, and embodied in our Bible,
   should be studied carefully in connection with this history.

   The evil in the two kingdoms waxed worse and worse, until no effort or
   pretence even, was made to serve the Lord, but of both Judah's kings
   and Israel's we read, each one "did that which was evil in the sight of
   the Lord;" and the doom pronounced against them in Deut. xxviii. 36,
   37, 63-68, was finally fulfilled, and they were "plucked from off"
   their own land, and "brought unto a nation which neither they nor their
   fathers had known." Israel's doom came first. In 2 Kings xvii. their
   wickedness seemed to culminate, and we read that "they rejected His
   statutes, and His covenant," and "left all the commandments of the Lord
   their God." "Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed
   them out of His sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.
   . . . . So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria
   unto this day."

   The doom of Judah, though somewhat later, came none the less surely. In
   2 Chron. xxxvi. we have the account of this. They "transgressed very
   much," we read, "until there was no remedy." And God brought upon them
   the "King of the Chaldees, who slew their young men in the house of
   their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
   man or him that stooped for age: He gave them all into his hand." And
   all the vessels and treasures of the house of the Lord were carried
   away to Babylon, and the house of the Lord was burned up, and the walls
   of Jerusalem broken down, and all her palaces burned with fire. And
   those who had escaped from the sword were carried away to Babylon,
   where they were "servants to the king and his sons."

   Babylon was not Egypt. Egypt, I believe, is a type of the state of
   nature out of which the Church is brought, while Babylon is the state
   of worldliness and corruption into which unfaithfulness brings her.
   Babylon seems to be always used in Scripture to set forth Satan's
   counterfeit of that which the Lord has made. If the Lord provides any
   good thing for His children, Satan provides a counterfeit of it,
   transforming himself even into an angel of light, if only thereby he
   may perchance deceive the elect. We do not hear of Babylon while Israel
   were in Egypt, nor during the early freshness of their joy in escaping
   from Egypt. It was an enemy who came to light only in the advanced
   period of their history. The Church knew nothing of the danger which
   Babylon typifies, during the early years of its existence, nor are
   Christians at once upon their conversion assailed by it. It is only
   when Churches or individual believers have been drawn away from their
   faithful allegiance to the law of the Lord, when they have substituted
   the commandments and traditions of men for the commandments of God, and
   have begun to "mock the true messengers of the Lord, and despise His
   words and misuse His prophets," that the danger, typified by Babylon
   and its kings, comes in. A false and corrupt rule takes possession of
   the heart, and carries it captive. The precious truths, which were part
   of the worship of the true God, typified by the "vessels of the house
   of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord,"
   are taken for the service of the false religion; and the strength and
   wisdom, typified by the young men and the old men, are made to be
   servants to the king who has taken them captive. I am sure that our
   knowledge of the sad lapses into corruption of portions of the Church
   of all ages, and of individual Christian experiences now, can confirm
   all this.

   A watchful walk with the Lord would have saved Judah from it all. They
   had had warnings without number, throughout the whole course of their
   declension, for we read that the "Lord God of their fathers sent to
   them by His messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because He had
   compassion on his people, and on His dwelling-place." 2 Chron. xxxvi.
   15. And I feel sure that no soul now falls into backsliding or
   captivity, without continued and oft repeated warning, both from within
   and without. The Lord sends messengers to such now, as really as He did
   to Judah then, because He has compassion on them; messengers of outward
   sorrow, and suffering, and loss, or messengers of inward condemnation
   and heaviness of heart. The blessed Holy Spirit "rises up betimes" and
   speaks to them in a voice they cannot mistake, giving them a sight of
   their condition and its dangers, and drawing them back to obedience
   tenderly and lovingly, or seeking to drive them with stern rebuke. And
   the danger for such, lies just where it did for Judah's last king, of
   what we read that he "humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet,
   speaking from the mouth of the Lord."

   I feel therefore that the lesson of this story calls loudly upon each
   one of us, and especially upon those who may have advanced in their
   experience as far as the reign of peace, to take heed to every warning
   sent in love and compassion to save us from similar backsliding, even
   though that warning may be but the slight inward check or call of the
   indwelling Spirit.

   The six books of Kings, and the history of the kingdom close with this
   captivity. But there is, notwithstanding all, a most blessed question
   asked in the very last sentence of 2 Chronicles, which opens up before
   us a possibility of return from backsliding, and of individual
   faithfulness, even in the time of the nation's captivity. It appears
   that "the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia," and
   charged him "to build Him an House in Jerusalem," and Cyrus made a
   proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it in writing, saying,
   "Who is there among you of all His people? The Lord his God be with him
   and let him go up!"

   In the books of Ezra and Nehemiah we have this question answered, and
   the remnant, whose hearts stirred them up to individual faithfulness,
   are there brought be- fore us, with the work that they did, and its
   blessed results.

CHAPTER XV.

EZRA.

  RESTORATION FROM BACKSLIDING, OR INDIVIDUAL FAITHFULNESS IN A TIME OF

  GENERAL UNFAITHFULNESS.

  Keynote: 2 Cor. vi. 16-18.

   THE books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the story of the faithful
   remnant, who went up out of Babylon, during the time of the captivity,
   to rebuild the temple and the walls of the city. They present us with a
   picture of restoration from backsliding, and of individual faithfulness
   in a time of general unfaithfulness; and seem to me to be a type of
   every true effort made now, by any Christian heart, after a closer walk
   with God.

   We live in a dispensation that seems to have failed almost as
   grievously as did that of the Israelites. The Church of Christ is full
   of worldliness, formality, and even idolatry. Many of the Lord's own
   people are carried away captive into the spiritual Babylon; and there
   is needed now, as much as there was then, a faithful remnant, "whose
   spirit God has raised" to go up to build the house of the Lord, and to
   rebuild the walls of the spiritual Jerusalem.

   These two books of Ezra and Nehemiah set before us in type, the blessed
   truth, that the general unfaithfulness or corruption of all around us,
   need be no hindrance to a faithful walk on our part, and that there is
   a path opened, by which we may individually separate from all that is
   opposed to the Lord, and may return to Him with a renewed consecration
   of ourselves, body, soul, and spirit, to be His temple, and to bear
   witness to His indwelling presence.

   No especial tokens of God's power attended this work of the remnant. It
   was a humble, and, as it were, a hidden work; and yet the promise
   concerning it was, Haggai ii. 9: "The glory of this latter house shall
   be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this
   place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts." When all Israel was
   faithful, it was an easy thing for each individual Israelite to be so.
   But in the time of Israel's captivity, it required peculiar devotedness
   of heart to "go up out of captivity," and was therefore peculiarly
   pleasing to the Lord. And just so, I believe, there is for us now, an
   especial sweetness and joy in a path which is one of hidden
   faithfulness, with but little of outward glory or honor connected with
   it. As our Lord says, "Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and when
   they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you, and
   shall cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. Rejoice ye
   in that day, and leap for joy: for behold, your reward is great in
   heaven: for in like manner did their fathers unto the prophets."

   In Ezra we have the rebuilding of the temple, and in Nehemiah the walls
   of the city are rebuilt. The inward restoration must come first. As the
   building of the temple in the first place, seems to me to have been a
   type of the soul consciously surrendering itself to be the temple of
   the Holy Ghost; so now the rebuilding of this temple, typifies, I
   think, the restoration of the soul from backsliding or wandering, and a
   fresh surrender of the heart to the Lord, to be possessed and indwelt
   by Him. It is what is happening, I believe, in very many instances in
   the present day. Believers are, as we know, being brought to a sense of
   their distance from the Lord, and are groaning under their captivity to
   their enemies. The song has gone out of their hearts, and the language
   used by the exiled Israelites to describe their own sad condition, is
   the language found to be most appropriate to theirs: "By the rivers of
   Babylon, there we sat down: yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. We
   hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, they
   that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that
   wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of
   Zion. How shall we sing the Lord's songs in a strange land?" Ps.
   cxxxvii. 1-4. And these have heard, as plainly as Israel of old, the
   call to go up to Jerusalem to build the house of the Lord and many have
   obeyed this call. To such, this book of Ezra will be full of wonderful
   teaching.

   A few points deserve especial notice. First of all, it was a voluntary
   thing on the part of those who went. It was only such as went
   willingly, who could go at all. But of all these a loving record was
   kept in God's own Book; see chap. ii. "Now these are the children of
   the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been
   carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away
   unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto
   his city; which came with Zerubbabel." The whole number being 42,360.
   ii. 24.

   And to all the ages of believers since, has this sample- page out of
   the Lord's book of record come, to teach us that not even a cup of cold
   water, given in the name of a disciple, shall lose its reward.
   Sometimes we have been inclined to wonder why there should occur, now
   and then, in the Bible, these long lists of names. But if we think of
   them thus, as sample pages out of the Divine book of records, they
   assume a deep and precious interest. Just so, doubtless, is our Father
   keeping the record of those now, who, in these days of half-heartedness
   and degeneracy, are offering themselves to Him in a glad surrender, to
   be His temple, and to be filled with His abiding presence!

   None were allowed to serve who were strangers to Israel, Ezra iv. 1-3,
   nor even those among the Israelites themselves, who "could not show
   their Father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel," see
   ii. 59-62. So only the true children of God, and those moreover also,
   who know of a certainty that they are His children, can ever enter upon
   this glorious work of consecration and restoration. It is essential to
   notice this. It is not conversion we are speaking of here, but
   restoration. The children of Israel were not now being brought out of
   Egypt, but restored from Babylon. And the first point to be settled
   always, in every such restoration, is that of assurance, the knowledge
   that our sins are forgiven, and that we are in very truth the children
   of God. We must be able to "shew our Father's house," and to "declare
   our genealogy," or we, too, shall be "put from the priesthood."

   In chapter iii. the children of Israel, who were thus a numbered and
   recognized people, "gathered themselves together as one man to
   Jerusalem;" and under the direction of Joshua and Zerubbabel, they
   "builded the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings
   thereon." This must always be the first step in the restoration of any
   backslidden heart. The burnt offering altar represented Christ as the
   atoning sacrifice, making us at one with the Lord. The whole thought of
   this offering was at-one-ment. It was "an offering by fire of a sweet
   savour unto the Lord," Lev. i. 9; and proved to the offerer, in a way
   he could not mistake, his acceptance with God. To set up the burnt
   offering altar, for us, therefore, signifies a realization of our
   perfect acceptance, or at-one-ment with the Lord. And the returning
   heart needs this assurance, before any other step can be taken.

   They next laid the foundations of the Lord's house, iii. 10-13; and so
   great was the joy of Israel at this, that we read "all the people
   shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the
   foundation of the house of the Lord was laid." But they were not
   allowed to proceed with their work unmolested. In chapter iv. we read,
   that when their "adversaries" heard that "the children of the captivity
   builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel," they came to them and
   said, "'Let us build with you.'" And when this was refused, they sought
   to "weaken their hands," and trouble them, and to "frustrate their
   purpose." Satan, who is our adversary, cannot endure to see any soul
   surrendering itself to the Lord to be His temple, and he always puts
   forth his utmost efforts to hinder all such. At first he seeks to mar
   the work by his cooperation, trying to bring wrong motives and unlawful
   means into play; and when this fails through the believer's
   faithfulness to his Lord, he then rouses opposition and persecution;
   see iv. 1-16. The result of this was that the "work ceased," and for
   many years, until the "second year of the reign of Darius," the burnt
   offering altar, and the foundations of the temple, were all that
   existed among the Israelites as a witness for the Lord their God. It is
   true, a prohibition came finally from the king; but many years had
   passed before this, and it is evident that it was want of faith in the
   Israelites, that was the real hindrance. Their enemies "weakened their
   hands," and "frustrated their purposes," and they were discouraged from
   their work.

   I think this is a true picture of that which often happens in the
   history of a returning soul. The believer restored from backsliding,
   realizes his acceptance with the Lord, and the foundations of the
   inward temple are afresh laid with joy. But discouragements arise; the
   hands are weakened by fear, and the adversary stirs up opposition on
   every side. Friends grow anxious lest there should be danger of
   fanaticism; the Church turns a cold shoulder; older Christians
   remonstrate; until finally the believer "ceases his work," and the
   temple remains unfinished: the soul stops short of the fulness of the
   blessing.

   The Lord, however, was not content with this state of things. He longed
   still, as always, to dwell among His people; and in the "second year of
   the reign of Darius," He sent Haggai to stir them up. "Then came the
   word of the Lord by Haggai the prophet saying, Is it time for you, O
   ye, to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house to lie waste?" Hag.
   i. 3, 4. Moreover he showed them what were the sad results of this
   neglect. "Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your
   ways. Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not
   enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but
   there is none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages, to put it
   into a bag with holes. Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your
   ways. Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I
   will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord. Ye
   looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it
   home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the Lord of hosts. Because of mine
   house that is waste, and ye run every man to his own house. Therefore
   the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from
   her fruit. And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
   mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil,
   and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon
   cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands." Hag. i. 7-11.

   I believe these words will find an echo in many disappointed hearts,
   whose restoration from backsliding has not brought the spiritual
   prosperity they had hoped for, and who yet have failed to suspect the
   cause. Spiritual drought and poverty must always be more or less the
   portion of every believer, who does not know fully the inward building
   of the temple of the heart, for the Lord to dwell in.

   We read, however, concerning Israel, that, at the prophesying of
   Haggai, "they obeyed the voice of the Lord their God," and "that the
   Lord stirred up the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they
   came and did work in the house of the Lord of hosts," Haggai i. 12-14.
   Their fear and discouragement had ended many years before in a decree
   being issue against them; but now their faith was so strong, that,
   without waiting for the reversal of this decree, they began to build at
   once. And the effect of this faith was such, that even their
   "adversaries," who had stopped them before, were the means of a decree
   in their favor now, and were even compelled to help them. See chaps. v.
   and vi., especially vi. 6-9, "And the elders of the Jews builded, and
   they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet, and
   Zechariah the son of Iddo: and they builded and finished it." vi. 14.

   They then "kept the dedication of this house of the Lord with joy;" and
   offered abundance of sacrifices, vi. 17, and set the priests and
   Levites in their rightful places "for the service of God," "as it is
   written in the book of Moses," vi. 18. When the heart is fully
   surrendered to the Lord to be His temple, there will always come
   abundance of sacrifice, and priestly service, according to His own
   commandments.

   Moreover they kept the Passover, the memorial of their redemption out
   of Egypt, of which all might partake who were purified, and who had
   "separated themselves from the filthiness of the heathen of the land,"
   vi, 19, 20, 21. And finally, they kept the "feast of unleavened bread
   with joy; for the Lord had made them joyful," vi. 22. The feast of
   unleavened bread was a type of holiness, and the joy of being made a
   partaker of Christ's holiness, will always come to the believer, who
   has reached this stage in his experience, and who knows that his heart
   is indeed the "temple of the Holy Ghost."

   In chapters vii. and viii. we have the account of Ezra's return to
   Jerusalem with a further remnant, who were "minded of their own
   free-will to go up to Jerusalem;" and of this remnant also a faithful
   record is kept, all of them we read, being "expressed by name," viii.
   20. This return of Ezra was for the purpose of instructing the people
   in the law; for Ezra "was a ready scribe in the law," and we are told
   that he "had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do
   it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments," vii. 6-10. A
   heart-whole dedication will open the inward ear to listen to the law of
   the Lord, and He will always send teaching therein. Even as we read in
   John xiv. 26: "But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the
   Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring
   all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."

   The coming of Ezra to teach the law of the Lord, at once made manifest
   the sins into which the remnant had fallen, ix. 1, for "the word of God
   is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing
   even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and
   marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,"
   Heb. iv. 12. The necessity for a practical outward separation, to
   correspond to the inward separation, forced itself upon the consciences
   of the people; and the princes came to Ezra and said, "The people of
   Israel and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves
   from the people of the land doing according to their abominations; . .
   . yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this
   trespass." Ezra was confounded at this discovery, and "sat down
   astonished until the evening sacrifice," ix. 3, 4. At the time of the
   evening sacrifice he fell upon his knees and poured out his heart in
   confession and prayer, ix. 5-15. The hearts of the people also were
   touched, and they "wept very sore." And they said, "We have trespassed
   against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the
   land; yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing. Now
   therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the
   wives, and such as are born of them." And at once they set themselves
   to the work of separation and obedience. All Israel was summoned to
   gather themselves "together unto Jerusalem" within three days, and "all
   the people," we read, "sat in the street of the house of God trembling,
   because of this matter, and for the great rain," x. 9. "Then Ezra arose
   and made a proclamation:" Now therefore make confession unto the Lord
   God of your fathers, and do His pleasure; and separate yourselves from
   the people of the land, and from the strange wives. And all the
   congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so
   must we do." Under the direction of Ezra this work of separation from
   their "strange wives" was at last accomplished; and here the book of
   Ezra leaves them.

   It remains true throughout all generations that "holiness becometh
   thine house, O Lord, forever." And invariably, from the place where the
   Lord dwelleth, all evil must be put away. When the soul, therefore, has
   afresh surrendered itself to the Lord to be His dwelling-place, the
   searching power of His Holy Spirit begins to reveal the evil, and calls
   for an entire separation from it.

   This matter of the "strange wives" seems to me to be a type of that
   wandering of the heart from the Lord, which is called "setting our
   affections on earthly things." The New Testament speaks of it as the
   "friendship of the world," and in Jas. iv. 4, we are told that this
   friendship is "enmity with God;" for whosever will be a "friend of the
   world, is the enemy of God." Also, in I John ii. 15, we read, "Love not
   the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love
   the world, the love of the Father is not in him." The life of
   separation to the Lord must be real. All that answers to this union
   with strange wives, must be put away, and also all that which is the
   fruit of it. The Lord must have our whole hearts, for our love is
   precious to Him, and anything which entices our hearts from our
   allegiance to Him must be given up. "He that loveth father or mother
   more than me is not worthy of me; and he that liveth son or daughter
   more than me is not worthy of me." "So likewise whosoever he be of you
   that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."

   A poor woman, living alone in a country neighbor- hood, who supported
   herself by keeping a little country shop, was greatly stirred on the
   subject of her soul's salvation, but was continually hindered in all
   her prayers and efforts, by an indulged sin. She sold ale without a
   license, and it was by far the most profitable part of her business;
   but her conscience was uneasy with it, and whenever she prayed or
   thought of being a Christian, this illicit trade would start up between
   her soul and the Lord. The struggle went on for many months, and over
   and over she resolved to give up the ale, but could never quite bring
   herself to the actual point. Finally, she attended a meeting one night,
   where the subject of the preacher was the blessedness and the joy of
   Christ's indwelling presence in the heart and in the life. She listened
   with delight. Nothing was said about giving up anything; and she said
   to herself, "Ah, that is just what will suit me, to have Christ always
   with me in my lonely cottage!" And in the utmost simplicity of faith
   she began at once to ask Him to come, and believed that He did. The
   preacher had spoken about His knocking at our hearts for admittance,
   and about our opening to let Him in, and this poor woman caught the
   idea at once, and began to say over and over, "I open to Thee, Lord
   Jesus, and now I believe Thou dost come in, and I am going to take Thee
   home with me to-night, and keep Thee there. Mind Thee, Lord Jesus, I
   have let Thee in;" and all the way home, in her lonely walk across the
   fields, she kept repeating, "Now I am taking Thee home with me, Thou
   knowest. Remember, Lord Jesus, I am taking Thee home." Gradually, as
   she thus by faith claimed His presence, she began to feel a sweet
   consciousness of it; and by the time she had reached her own door, He
   had become so precious to her, that all else seemed worthless in
   comparison. All this time she had not once thought of the ale. But as
   she opened her cottage door, the first thing she set her eyes upon was
   a large pot of ale standing on the table. At once the thought came,
   "Oh, the Lord Jesus won't stay if I keep that ale!" And so sweet had
   His presence become to her by this time, that the ale was as nothing.
   She kneeled right down beside the table and said, "Now, Lord Jesus, I
   have brought Thee home with me, and here is this ale, and I know Thou
   won't stay if the ale does. So please give me strength to heave that
   ale right out into the road." She rose and lifted the heavy pot, and it
   was soon emptied of all its contents. Then she returned into her
   cottage and kneeled down again and said, "Thank Thee, Lord Jesus, for
   giving me strength to get rid of that ale. And now, if there is
   anything else in this house, that Thou cannot stay here with, please
   show me, and that shall go too."

   It remains to be true throughout all ages, that as the presence of
   light must inevitably drive out darkness, so the realized presence of
   Christ in any heart or any life must inevitably drive out sin.
   "Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not."

   This entire separation from all evil, with a list of those who "gave
   their hands that they would put away their wives," closes the book of
   Ezra; leaving Israel thus prepared for the work, which Nehemiah
   chronicles in the next book.

   Does it leave us also prepared for a similar work, dear readers? Has
   the presence of Christ in our hearts, driven out the sin there, and
   have we "given our hands" to put away all that is contrary to His will?

CHAPTER XVI.

NEHEMIAH.

  RESTORATION FROM BACKSLIDING, OR FAITHFUL SERVICE IN A TIME OF GENERAL

  UNFAITHFULNESS.

  Keynote: 1 Cor. iii. 8-15.

   THE book off Nehemiah gives us the rebuilding of the walls of
   Jerusalem. Like Ezra, it shows us in type, a picture of restoration
   from backsliding, and of individual faithfulness in a time of general
   unfaithfulness. The city of Jerusalem had been ravaged and destroyed by
   the King of the Chaldees, and, as we read Neh. i. 3, "the wall of
   Jerusalem was broken down, and the gates thereof were burned with
   fire."

   While dwelling in the palace of King Artaxerxes, the heart of Nehemiah
   was stirred up by the account he received of the desolate condition of
   his beloved city, and he cried to the Lord to grant him His favor, and
   to incline the heart of the king to permit him to return unto Judah,
   and unto the city of his fathers' sepulchres, that he might rebuild its
   walls, i. 1-11. The king granted the request, and Nehemiah returned to
   Jerusalem, and went out by night to view the wall. He found it was
   indeed as it had been reported to him, and he went to the elders of the
   city and said unto them, "Ye see the distress that we are in, how
   Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire;
   come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a
   reproach." Then he told them how the hand of the Lord was on him for
   this work; and, stirred by his words, they said, "Let us rise up and
   build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work," ii. 12-18.

   The temple having been built, in Ezra, and God's dwelling-place having
   been thus provided for, the people now can turn their thoughts to their
   city. Inward restoration always paves the way and prepares the heart
   for outward restoration; and this rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem
   seems to me to typify the outward work and service of the Christian, in
   whose heart the Lord dwells. Jerusalem may be taken as a figure of the
   Church, and the building of her walls and gates, as symbolizing that
   building up of the Church now, of which the Apostle speaks when he
   says, "Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek
   that ye may excel to the edifying (building up) of the Church," 1 Cor.
   xiv. 12. "And He gave some apostles; and some prophets; and some
   evangelists; and some pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the
   saints, for the work of the ministry; for the edifying (building up) of
   the body of Christ," Eph. iv. 11, 12.

   In chapter iii. we have a detailed account of the work that was done,
   and the names of the men who did it. This is another sample page out of
   the Lord's book of records, similar to the one we noticed in Ezra. How
   precious to see Him thus taking note of each man, and of all the
   details of each man's work. Men may pass over lightly the work which
   their brethren do for the Lord, and may even think their own work not
   worth remembering; but the Lord never forgets the smallest thing. How
   little did Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of
   Besodeiah, as they "laid the beams of the old gate, and set up the
   doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof," amid the
   sneers and assaults of their enemies, think that the record of their
   work was to go down to untold millions; and that, wherever the Bible
   should go, there would it be told as a memorial of them, iii. 6. But
   "God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which ye
   have showed to His name," and the weakest laborer may be sure that he
   is honorably mentioned in that blessed book of records, which is kept
   in the Lord's own house on high.

   It is very striking also to notice how often it is said that they built
   "every one over against his own house," and even "over against his
   chamber. See iii, 10, 23, 28, 29, 30. This teaches us the comforting
   truth, that we never need seek far for an acceptable service, or for
   one that will be valuable to our Lord; for if each one of us will but
   build over against our own house, or, if we possess but a chamber, over
   against that, the work of one will join on to the work of another, and
   the result will be a completed wall around the whole city. As we read
   in vi. 15, "So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the
   month Elul, in fifty and two days."

   But although thus successfully finished, the work had been carried on
   through great difficulties, for a disappointed enemy beset them on
   every side. At first they came with sneers, saying, "What do these
   feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will
   they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps
   of the rubbish which are burned? . . . . Even that which they build, if
   a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall" iv. 2, 3. And
   so likewise will our enemy seek to discourage us, when he sees us
   entering into the Lord's service with earnest hearts. He will come
   whispering in our hearts his sneers, and doubts, and mocking questions,
   "What do these feeble Christians? will such as they be able to
   accomplish anything? Even that which they build, shall it not after all
   come to naught?" But we must meet all such taunts as Nehemiah did, not
   with angry replies, nor even with arguments to prove our own strength
   and capability, but by simply committing our cause to the Lord, and
   leaving it with Him to deal with our enemy; "Hear, oh our God, for we
   are despised, and turn their reproach upon their own head," iv. 3-5.
   And we must only build on all the more resolutely, having as they had a
   "mind to the work."

   Sneers and taunts having failed, their enemies assailed the faithful
   builders in another way. For it came to pass that when they "heard that
   the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be
   stopped, then they were very wroth, and conspired, all of them
   together, to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it." If
   the enemy of our souls fails to discourage us by his sneers, then he
   assaults us with outward difficulties and oppositions, and with his
   fiery darts of temptation. But, as it was with Israel, the only effect
   must be to cause us to "make our prayer unto our God," and to set a
   watch against him day and night, iv. 7-9. Their adversaries thought to
   surprise them, saying, "They shall not know, neither see, till we come
   in the midst among them and slay them, and cause the work to cease,"
   iv. 11. But Nehemiah set a watch, and armed his people with armor, so
   that "every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the
   other hand held the weapon," iv. 16-18, and he said, "Be ye not afraid
   of them; remember the Lord which is great and terrible; and fight." "In
   what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye
   thither unto us: our God shall fight for us."

   Surely the New Testament counterpart of all this is to be found in such
   words as "Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation;" "Fight the
   good fight of faith:" "Resist the devil and he will flee from you."
   "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
   might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand
   against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and
   blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers
   of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
   places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be
   able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand
   therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the
   breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod with the preparation
   of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith,
   wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
   And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is
   the word of God: praying always with all prayer and supplication in the
   Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication
   for all saints."

   I am aware that those who teach a life of perfect rest and peace, are
   sometimes supposed to mean that there are no more assaults from our
   enemy in such a life. But this is so manifestly a misunderstanding,
   that it hardly seems necessary to say anything about it. And yet it is
   so difficult to explain just what we do mean, that I do not wonder we
   are misunderstood. For it is one of those marvellous paradoxes, in
   which two apparently irreconcilable things exist at the same moment,
   and perfectly harmonize. Peace and war, rest and labor, are one here.
   We fight, but it is the fight of faith, not of effort, for "our God
   fights for us," and therefore we are at perfect peace. We work, but it
   is not we who work, but God who worketh in us and through us, and
   therefore we rest. But to understand this, it must be experienced. We
   work as the instrument works in the hand of the skilful workman. We
   fight as the baby fights, who hides its head in its mother's bosom.


   "The dove hath neither claw nor sting,

   Nor weapon for the fight;

   She owes her safety to the wing,

   Her victory to flight;

   The Bridegroom opes His arms of love,

   And in them folds the panting dove."

   As the result of these faithful labors on the part of Nehemiah and the
   people, the wall was at last finished, and the Lord according to His
   promise that He "will bring forth our righteousness as the light, and
   our judgment as the noonday," if we but commit our way unto Him, and
   trust Him fully, made even the very enemies who had begun by mocking
   them, confess that the work they had so much despised, was after all of
   God. "And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof, and
   all the heathen that were round about us saw these things, they were
   much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was
   wrought of God," vi. 16.

   In chapter viii. we find that the immediate and blessed result of the
   work of restoration, which had been accomplished, was to bring the
   people to a renewed acquaintance with the law of the Lord. It had been
   many years since Ezra had come up to Jerusalem, for the express purpose
   of instructing Israel in His statutes and judgments. But the condition
   of things in which he found them, had unfitted them for hearing or
   understanding it. They were such as Paul describes in Heb. v. 12, "For
   when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach
   you again, which be the first principles of the oracles of God: and are
   become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat." During times
   of captivity and of unfaithfulness, the law of the Lord is lost sight
   of, and indeed, cannot even be understood. But when the soul is again
   restored to communion, and the presence of the Lord is afresh realized
   in our midst, then the Divine law becomes most precious. In truth, I
   think its preciousness is felt then as never before. And to my mind
   this chapter in Nehemiah gives us in picture a truer apprehension of
   the sweetness of the will of God, and of what it means to have that
   will perfectly done in our lives, than almost any other chapter in the
   Bible.

   The eagerness with which "all the people gathered themselves together
   as one man into the street that was before the water-gate," to hear the
   reading of the book of the law, is a picture of that "hungering and
   thirsting after righteousness," which comes to every soul that has been
   drawn near to the Lord. Since we have found Him so precious Himself, we
   begin to realize that His will must be precious also, and we begin to
   long to know it.

   From morning until midday they stood and listened to the reading, "both
   men and women, and all that could hear with understanding," while Ezra
   "read the law distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to
   understand the reading." And we are told that "the ears of all the
   people were attentive unto the book of the law." During the years of
   their captivity, this law had been but a vaguely remembered tradition
   among them, and it is no wonder that it should come to them now like a
   fresh and wondrous revelation.

   Their first impulse as they listened was to grieve. "For all the people
   wept when they heard the words of the law." Doubtless their grief had
   two causes, regret at their neglect of so wonderful a law, and fright
   at the discovery of their own great distance from its perfect
   righteousness. And so also, to souls in the present day, the fresh
   discovery of the will of God may perhaps at first cause tears and
   fright, as they see how great is their want of conformity to its
   blessed requirements. But in our case, as in theirs, if we only saw it
   aright, this very Will is our cause of deepest rejoicing. For Nehemiah
   said to the people, "This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not
   nor weep. . . . Go your way, eat the fat and drink the sweet, and send
   portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy
   unto our Lord; neither be ye sorry, for the joy of the Lord is your
   strength. So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your
   peace for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. And all the people
   went their way, to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make
   great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared
   unto them," viii. 1-11.

   A strange cause for mirth, some would say; even among those who profess
   to know and love the Lord, whose will they so dread. But to my mind the
   greatest cause of rejoicing that our poor world can have, lies just in
   this, that God has chosen to give to us His holy, and blessed, and
   lovely law, and has taught us to say, "Thy will be done." Without the
   will of God, this world would indeed be a place of concentrated misery.
   But the presence and accomplishment of His will, transforms it into an
   outer court of heaven.

   And did we but know our God and His love, I am sure we, too, as they
   did, "would make great mirth," as soon as we understood the words that
   are declared unto us.

   I confess I feel more deeply than I can express, the grievous wrong
   that is done to our Heavenly Father, by the evident dread His own
   children have of His blessed will. If they, who profess to know Him and
   trust Him, feel so about it, we cannot wonder that the world looks upon
   the will of God as something to be feared and resisted more than
   anything else, and we need not question why they are driven away from
   Him. If His own children regard Him as a tyrant, what can His enemies
   be expected to think? It is indeed most grievous, that Satan should
   have so veiled the loveliness of the will of God from the eyes of many
   Christians, that, instead of clinging to it as their chiefest good,
   they should so often shrink from it in fear and sorrow. Yet it is a
   fact which cannot be ignored, and which I would gladly meet and
   overcome, were it possible.

   For the will of God is always and under all circumstances good and
   best. He is love, and His will can be nothing but love. He is full of
   wisdom, and His will must always be wise. He is omnipotent, and His
   will is baffled by nothing that can oppose. He is just, and His will
   must be truly and perfectly just. The truth is, when I think of who and
   what our God is, I am amazed that it ever entered into the head of any
   one of us to fear or combat His will. We do not know what we are doing,
   when we indulge in such feelings. The idea that our Father, who loves
   us, can want anything but our best and truest happiness is
   inconceivable. His will for us must be all that is best, and sweetest,
   and most satisfying, and surely we can trust ourselves to it without a
   single shrinking or fearing thought.

   And when once we have opened our ears to listen to this will, we shall
   find, as the children of Israel did, that "His commands are not
   grievous," as perhaps we may have feared they would be; but that peace,
   and rest, and even "very great gladness" follow quickly in the keeping
   of His law. For the very second day of their reading, "they found
   written in the law which the Lord had commanded Moses, that the
   children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh
   month," viii. 14. This feast of tabernacles was a feast of joy. It was
   the celebration of their rest and possession of the land, after their
   journey through the wilderness. And thus they, who had expected perhaps
   commands which might cause them sorrow, found instead that their first
   duty was to joy and gladness. Not since the days of Joshua, had they
   known such joy!

   It is indeed true, as some one says, that "God's will on earth is
   always joy, always tranquility;" and so every soul finds it, whose
   surrender is absolute and unconditional. "Great peace have they that
   love Thy law, and nothing shall offend them."

   The result of this reading of the law, was great searching of heart
   among the Israelites, and in chapter ix. they tell their experience,
   and make their confession unto the Lord, and agree together solemnly to
   dedicate themselves unto Him, ix. 38. Chap. x. 1-27 gives us a roll of
   the names of "those that sealed" themselves unto this covenant, another
   blessed list, in which it is an everlasting glory to have been
   enrolled. And this list is, I believe, only a sample of the long and
   ever-increasing one, where are written the names of all who since then,
   have "sealed themselves" to be wholly the Lord's.

   The terms of their consecration are given us in x. 28-39, ending with
   the significant words, "and we will not forsake the house of our God."
   All depends upon this. As long as the dwelling-place of the Lord is in
   the midst of any people, or in any heart, holiness of life will
   necessarily follow. And sin, if it comes, will nearly always result
   from the heart having first forsaken the Lord's dwelling-place.

   In chaps. xi. and xii. there is given us another list of those who
   "willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem;" and also of those
   who "praised and gave thanks" at the "dedication of the wall of
   Jerusalem." See xii. 27-42. They could not sing while in captivity in
   Babylon, as we read in Ps. cxxxvii. 1-4. "By the rivers of Babylon,
   there we sat down, yea, there we wept when we remembered Zion. We
   hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there they
   that carried us away captive required of us a song: and they that
   wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of
   Zion. How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?" But now
   that their captivity had been turned, their mouths were filled with
   singing, as it had not been since the days of David and Asaph of old.
   We even read that they "sang loud," and that they "rejoiced with great
   joy; so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off." The soul in
   captivity cannot sing, but when the "Lord turns again the captivity of
   Zion," then are our "mouths filled with laughter, and our tongue with
   singing." The praises of His people are acceptable to the Lord, and
   this record of those who here praised and gave thanks is therefore very
   significant.

   The result of this joy, was a renewed and still deeper consecration.
   Again the book of the law was brought out, and read in the audience of
   the people, and it was found written therein, "that the Ammonite and
   the Mo abite should not come into the congregation of God for- ever,"
   xiii. 1. At once Israel set themselves to obey this command, and
   separated from themselves "all the mixed multitude," 1-3. And it was
   discovered that this evil had crept even into the very inner courts of
   God's house; for the "stuff of Tobiah," the Ammonite, had filled the
   chambers of the temple, where aforetime they had kept the meat
   offerings and the frankincense. But this was now cast forth, and the
   clambers cleansed, and restored to their proper use, xiii. 4-9. So
   deep-seated was this evil of fellowship with those from whom the Lord
   had commanded entire separation, that even the priest, who had the
   oversight of the chamber in the house of the Lord, was "allied with
   Tobiah," and had been left undisturbed in his alliance, vs. 4, 7. But
   all hidden and even unsuspected sins are brought to light, when the law
   of the Lord is yielded to in simple obedience; and the soul is then
   enabled to cleanse its innermost chambers of all the "stuff" belonging
   to the enemy, and to present the heart to the Lord, for His use only.

   Besides all this, it was found that the rest of the Sabbath was being
   habitually broken, by tradesmen of different kinds, who "brought all
   manner of burdens into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day." This, Nehemiah
   remedied, commanding the gates to be kept shut, and, setting some of
   his servants at the gates to watch "that there should no burden be
   brought in on the Sabbath day," xiii. 15-22. The Sabbath is a type of
   the rest of soul, Christ promises to all the wearied and heavy laden
   who come unto Him; and to break the Sabbath, therefore, symbolizes the
   breaking of this spiritual rest, by bearing burdens, which we are
   commanded to lay on the Lord. This is a very important point; for of
   all the declarations of God's will given us in the Gospel, none is more
   distinct and positive than this, that His people are to bear no burdens
   and carry no cares. "Be careful for nothing; "Take no thought for your
   life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
   what ye shall put on." "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it
   be afraid." "Cast all your care upon Him, for He careth for you." And I
   doubt whether we even begin to know the grief that we give to our Lord,
   by our disobedience to these commands. When we, who are strong,
   tenderly love any one who is weak and helpless, how it delights our
   hearts to bear their burdens and do their work for them, and how it
   grieves us, if they will not permit us the privilege. And this should
   make us understand the longing of our Lord's heart towards us, His poor
   weak and helpless little ones, whom He knows to be so unable to care
   for anything aright for themselves.

   A weary missionary lady in Persia went into a church there one Sabbath
   afternoon, and was obliged to sit down on a mat near the middle of the
   floor, as there were no other seats. She was very tired with her
   previous labors that day, and longed for rest; but with no support to
   her back, it seemed impossible to obtain it. In a moment a broad-backed
   native woman, noticing her look of extreme weariness, moved quietly up,
   and, planting her strong shoulders squarely behind her, whispered,
   "Lean on me." The lady leaned, but not with her whole weight. The fear
   of oppressing her kind friend, made her feel delicate about abandoning
   herself to the luxury of the support. But the native woman, with a look
   of longing love, leaned around and whispered to her in intensest
   tenderness, "Do you love me? If you love me, you will lean hard!" And
   then to that poor, weary body came rest, and to the weary spirit also
   came the sweet words from the Master, saying, "If you love Me, you will
   lean hard on Me also." Soul and body were rested, and from that time
   the dear missionary lady kept unbroken the blessed "Sabbath of rest,"
   upon which she then entered.

   Child of my love, "lean hard,"

   And let Me feel the pressure of thy care;

   I know thy burden, child; I shaped it,

   Poised it in Mine own hand, made no proportion

   In its weight to thine unaided strength:

   For even as I laid it on, I said,

   "I shall be near, and, while she leans on Me,

   This burden shall be mine, not hers.

   So shall I keep my child within the circling arms

   Of Mine own love." Here lay it down, nor fear

   To impose it on a shoulder which upholds

   The government of worlds. Yet closer come--

   Thou art not near enough, I would embrace thy care

   So I might feel My child reposing on My heart.

   Thou lovest Me? I know it. Doubt not then,

   But, loving Me--lean hard.

   Finally, the Lord's rest having been restored, a complete separation
   was made from all the "strange wives," who had either been left when
   Ezra made the former separation, or who had been married since; and
   Nehemiah closes his book with the words: "Thus cleansed I them from all
   strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests, and the Levites,
   every one in his business; and for the wood offering at times
   appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good."

   And as Nehemiah dealt faith the Israelites, so, I believe, will the
   blessed Holy Spirit deal now in faithful and loving rebuke with every
   soul that returns afresh to the law of the Lord, teaching us and
   enabling us to "cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and
   spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."

   What comfort there is for thee here, beloved Christian. Thou mayest
   have wandered far from thy Lord, and have been taken captive by cruel
   enemies. His law may have been lost to thee, and thy heart may have
   formed many close alliances with strangers. But a path is here opened
   before thee, by which thou mayest return, and which will lead thee out
   of all that is contrary to His will. Do not therefore be afraid to face
   the truth as to thy present spiritual condition; and do not admit the
   thought that thou hast been carried captive too far and too long for
   restoration to be possible to thee. For in the swift transitions of our
   spiritual life, the very time that reveals a failure, may reveal the
   remedy also, and at once that remedy may be applied, and the soul
   delivered. And that which took years for the children of Israel, may be
   accomplished for thee in a Divine moment.

   "Who is there therefore among you of all his people? His God be with
   him and let him go up."

CHAPTER XVII.

ESTHER.

  GOD'S HIDDEN PROVIDENTIAL CARE OVER HIS PEOPLE IN THEIR CAPTIVITY.

  Keynote: Heb. xiii. 5, 6.

   THE book of Esther closes the series of the historical books of the Old
   Testament. It takes up the condition of the Jews, who "had been carried
   away from Jerusalem with the captivity," ii. 5, 6, and who had remained
   behind in the land of their enemy, when the faithful remnant under Ezra
   and Nehemiah had returned to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple and the
   walls of the city. These captives are shown here, to be still the
   objects of God's care, although they would seem to have forfeited all
   right to it, by their failure to return to their own land when an
   opportunity was afforded them.

   The details of this story are very simple. The Gentile wife of
   Ahasuerus, having been set aside because of her disobedience, the king
   chose for her successor a lowly Jewish maiden, belonging to the captive
   race; and her uncle and protector Mordecai "sat in the king's gate,"
   ii. 19. One of the king's servants, Haman the Agagite, was advanced to
   a place of great honor, and all the king's servants bowed and
   reverenced him, but we read that "Mordecai bowed not nor did him
   reverence." In this no doubt Mordecai as a Jew, was governed by a
   command of the Lord, which was more binding to him than even the
   command of Ahasuerus. For Haman was an Agagite, and the family of Agag
   were of the nation of Amalek, whom Israel as far back as Exodus had
   been commanded utterly to destroy. See Ex. xvii. 14-16; Deut. xxv.
   17-19. The wrath of Haman at this disrespect, led him to desire the
   destruction of the whole nation to which Mordecai belonged. For Haman
   "thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone;" wherefore he "thought
   to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of
   Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai." "And Haman said unto King
   Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed
   among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom: and their laws
   are diverse from all people: neither keep they the king's laws:
   therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them. If it please
   the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed." King Ahasuerus
   consented, and posts were immediately sent out into all his provinces
   with commandment to destroy "all Jews, both young and old, little
   children and women, in one day." iii. 11-15.

   Mordecai at once made application to Esther to inter- cede with the
   king on behalf of her nation; and Esther braved the king's displeasure,
   by going into his presence unsummoned, and requesting him to come that
   day with Haman to a banquet she would prepare for them. At this banquet
   she invited them to a second one on the following day, where she
   promised to tell out her petition. Meanwhile, on that very night, the
   king could not sleep, and he commanded them to bring the book of
   records to be read to him, vi. 1,2. There "it was found written" that
   Mordecai had saved the king's life from a conspiracy, and his gratitude
   was so stirred at the remembrance of it, that he bestowed upon Mordecai
   great honor, unconsciously making use of his worst enemy, Haman the
   Agagite, to carry out the plans. And at the second banquet the whole
   story of Haman's cruelty was brought out, and Haman was hanged, and the
   king issued a decree giving the Jews permission to "gather themselves
   together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to
   cause to perish all the power of the people and provinces that would
   assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them
   for a prey," vii. 10, 11. The result of this was a general deliverance
   to the Jews throughout all the provinces which were from India unto
   Ethiopia; and the "Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honor,"
   viii 16, 17. And "Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and
   great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren,
   seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed,"
   x. 3.

   Such is the story of the book of Esther. Some seem to have seen in it a
   typical picture of the Kingdom of God upon earth; taking Ahasuerus as a
   type of the Most High Jehovah, Vashti as a type of rejected Israel,
   Esther as a type of the chosen Church, Mordecai as a type of the Lord
   Jesus, and Haman as a type of Satan. But this seems rather fanciful to
   me; and I confess that I have no clear apprehension of any especial
   typical teaching as intended here. The story of Esther, like that of
   Ruth, is the story of a bride. In both a lowly maiden is exalted to a
   place of honor and wealth. And it seems probable, although one was a
   Gentile and the other a Jew, that they were both meant to typify in
   some way the future story of the Church of Christ, chosen from her low
   estate, and called to the glorious destiny of sharing the throne with
   her heavenly Bridegroom.

   But I incline to think that the lesson to be drawn from this little
   book, is rather moral than typical. We have given to us here, the
   secret and providential care of the Lord over His people, even when
   they were in captivity in an enemy's country, and at a time when they
   seemed to be utterly unmindful of Him. God's people may forget Him, but
   He cannot forget them, and wherever they may be, He watches over and
   cares for them.

   The book of Esther, therefore, seems to me to teach the much-needed
   lesson that even at times, when, on account of their unfaithfulness,
   the Lord may seem to have hidden Himself, or to have forsaken His
   people, His care over them is as real as ever, although it may be a
   secret care, which is altogether hidden from their eyes. The name of
   the Lord is not once mentioned in this book, because His agency in
   their deliverance could not be made manifest to a people so far off
   from Him, and yet to the anointed eye there can be traced plainly
   throughout the whole of it, His providential care, Behind all their
   neglect of Him, and His seeming forgetfulness of them, He held the
   reins of His providence, and by a series of apparently natural events,
   and by most unlikely means, using the king's sleeplessness even as one
   link in this chain, He brought to pass His will concerning them, and
   saved them in the time of their need, see vi. 1-3.

   I have said that the name of the Lord was not once mentioned in this
   book, yet that the thought of Him was there, and that His hand was
   recognized in the events that took place, is very evident from the fact
   of a fast being proclaimed by Esther and Mordecai, iv. 16, which could
   have no other meaning than that of prayer to the Being whose Name is
   left unspoken; and also from the establishment of the "feast of Purim"
   which has been celebrated by the Jews for all the centuries since, as
   the memorial of a great national deliverance, ix. 17, 26. Even as I
   write, the daily papers are calling attention to the fact that at this
   very time the feast of Purim is being kept. One paper says, "By the
   unanimous consent of the entire body of the Jewish people, the festival
   of Purim has been observed for a period of about 2500 years. Devoted to
   rejoicing and hilarity, without sinking into Bacchanalian orgies, it
   has taken deep hold on the affections of the Jews, and its annual
   return is hailed with such marked demonstrations of pleasure, as to
   show that it occupies no inferior position in their estimation. In
   pious gratitude for the joyful termination of Haman's plot, Esther and
   Mordecai enjoined all Israelites and their descendants to celebrate the
   14th and 15th day of Adar as "days of feasting and joy, of sending
   presents one to another, and gifts to the poor." In the spirit in which
   the festival was instituted, it is observed at the present day. On the
   eve of Purim, and again on the following morning, the Jews assemble in
   their synagogues to offer prayers and hymns of thanksgiving to God, and
   to listen to the reading of Megillah, or Book of Esther. The rich
   distribute alms bountifully to their poorer brethren, presents are
   interchanged, social reunions take place, and no Jew permits the day to
   pass without devoting some portion of it to domestic comfort and
   happiness."

   The teaching of this book is therefore, that the Lord, though hidden,
   still cares for His people. And it is a teaching of great practical
   importance for every one of us.

   The natural heart finds it hard to trust in an unseen Care-taker; and
   when Christians wander away from the Lord and forget Him, they can
   hardly believe that He does not forget them. They talk about being
   forsaken; and, because their own love has grown cold, they imagine that
   His has also. They judge Him to be altogether such as themselves in
   their unfaithfulness, and measure His truth by their own falseness. But
   the Scriptures reveal a far other God than this. They reveal One who
   "having loved His own, that were in the world, loved them to the end,"
   even though they forsook Him and fled. They show forth a Shepherd who
   does not leave His sheep on the cloudy and dark day, nor when the wolf
   cometh; but who draws nearer than ever in such times of need, and who
   always goes after the ones that wander. They tell us of a Saviour who
   saves the lost, not the found, and of a Physician who heals the sick,
   not the well. They declare to us the glorious fact that He never leaves
   nor forsakes us, and that always and everywhere He is watching over us
   and caring for us in tenderest love, and with infinite wisdom. Our sins
   separate us from Him, but they do not separate Him from us; and we
   never get from under His providential care. This care may be hidden,
   but it is none the less real, and all things in the daily events of our
   lives are made to work subservient to the Lord's gracious purposes
   towards us. "Can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not
   have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will
   I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee on the palms of my hands:
   thy walls are continually before me," Is. xlix. 15, 16.

   This thought would have wonderful power to restore the soul of the
   backslider, were it but fully realized continually. Coldness, and
   neglect, and indifference we can resist and resent, and be only driven
   away the further; but who can turn always from the persistent love and
   care that will not be rebuffed, and that never forgets our need? And
   even backsliding Israel will at last be won by this love that has so
   followed them throughout all their rebellions and backsliding, and
   will, when the final and crowning proof of undying love has come in
   their restoration and establishment in their own land, be brought to
   "remember their own evil ways, and their doings that were not good, and
   shall loathe themselves in their own sight for their iniquities and for
   their abominations," Ez. xxxvi. 31. "And they shall look upon Me whom
   they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him as one mourneth for his
   only son, and shall be in bitterness for Him as one that is in
   bitterness for his first-born," Zech. xii. 10.

   No doubt, in Esther we have an insight into the Lord's providential
   care of His people from that time onward. The day of their "scattering"
   still continues, but the Lord still watches over them as faithfully as
   He did then, though as secretly. And in every country or nation where a
   single one of His chosen nation are today abiding, His providential
   care is, I doubt not, ordering all outward events to work together for
   their preservation and their final deliverance. Only in this way can we
   account for their marvellous history down to the present time. They are
   still His people, beloved and blessed, in spite of their long-continued
   unfaithfulness; and His sovereign unfailing care, come what will, is
   unceasingly exercised in their behalf.

   But if all this is true of the Lord's people, when living afar off from
   Him in the land of their captivity, how much more true must it be of
   those who are seeking to follow Him closely, and to abide continually
   in the land of promise which He has given them! Surely to all such, no
   single doubt of His constant watchfulness and care ought ever to be
   permitted to come, even though no manifest token of His presence is
   discernible! And the lesson of Esther to each one of us must be, to
   teach us to rest in a serene and unwavering trust, even in the midst of
   the most mysterious dispensations, sure that He overrules and controls
   it all, and that nothing that affects us, whether seen or unseen,
   whether in the minds of others or in our own, escapes His care.

CHAPTER XVIII.

JOB.

  THE DEATH OF SELF.

  Keynote: Heb. xii. 5-11.

   THE book of Esther, as we have seen, closed the historical series of
   books in the Old Testament. In Job we now enter upon another series,
   containing, I think, the inward exercises of the hearts of God's
   people, as to sanctification. This series consists of Job, Psalms,
   Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs; and seems to give us a
   progressive development of heart experience, beginning with the deal of
   self in Job, and culminating in a realized union with the Lord in the
   Song of Songs.

   In Job we have the death of self. Man is taught to see himself as he
   really is in the Lord's presence. His utter weakness and need are here
   revealed to him, and he is brought to an end of the self-life. In
   Psalms we have the resurrection life, the "life hid with Christ in
   God." Man is there taught to know the Lord, and is shown how to draw
   from Him the supplies for his weakness and need. In Proverbs we have
   this dead and risen man surrendering himself to the teachings of Divine
   wisdom, by which he is shown the path to walk in. In Ecclesiastes the
   world is sought in vain for an object to satisfy this deeply-taught
   soul. And in the Song of Songs this Object is found, and the heart
   rests eternally in a realized union with its Beloved. Job is the first
   step in the soul's experience, and Canticles is the last; and Canticles
   can never be reached, until Job has been first passed through. These
   steps are more or less marked in the experience of every sanctified
   soul, I think, and come mostly in the same order. We must first be
   brought to an end of self, as in Job, before we can learn what it is to
   live the life hid with Christ in God, as in Psalms. But in this
   resurrection life, we realize the need of guidance in order to walk
   safely through the crooked paths of the world, and must therefore yield
   ourselves up to the teachings of Divine wisdom, as in Proverbs. The
   world will then drop from our hands as an utterly unsatisfying thing,
   as in Ecclesiastes. And finally the soul will find itself prepared to
   be united to its Lord in a blessed oneness, which forever satisfies its
   needs and its longings, as in Canticles.

   The first step in this developing series of heart exercises is, as I
   have said, that man should be brought to an end of self; and the Lord's
   first dealings with him, therefore, will be directed to this. In the
   book of Job we seem to have these dealings plainly set before us, and
   are there shown, as it were, the Lord's processes with His saints. We
   get behind the scenes here, into His secret counsels, and are made to
   understand the hidden mystery of trial, and see how it all has its
   spring in God, let the instrumentalities be what they may; and is all
   meant to make us "partakers of His holiness." It is the work of the
   Refiner that is here revealed to us. And I feel that it is unspeakably
   blessed for us, thus as it were, to get a glimpse into His work-shop,
   and see His processes of refining the gold committed to His care. The
   mystery of suffering is so unfathomable to most of us, and the
   questions it asks are so unanswerable, and often so agonizing, that we
   cannot be thankful enough for the glorious and satisfying answer given
   us in this book of Job; nor can we rest our hearts too utterly upon the
   revelation here made. "No chastening for the present seemeth to be
   joyous, but grievous. Nevertheless afterward it worketh the peaceable
   fruits of righteousness to them that are exercised thereby." This is
   the lesson of Job.

   Job was a righteous man, coming under the refining and purifying hand
   of the Lord, in order that he might be brought to an end of self, and
   might have a revelation of God to his soul. And in this he was a sample
   and a foretelling of the thousands of saints since, who have had to go
   through similar processes, for the same glorious and blessed end."
   There was a certain man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that
   man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed
   evil," i. 1.

   It was necessary that a righteous man should have been chosen for that
   which was to follow, since it is the training of God's saints that is
   here set forth; and none but a good man could have understood the
   lessons or profited by them. Moreover it is plain to the simplest
   comprehension, that a wicked man needs to be brought to the end of
   himself. But that an upright man, who "fears God and eschews evil,"
   should also need this, is not so clear. And some who can look, with a
   complacent comprehension of the divine purposes, on the trials that
   fall to the lot of the sinners around them, are yet unable to discover
   any reason for the mysterious dispensation of suffering to themselves.
   They are conscious, it may be, of the integrity of their hearts, and
   cannot see the justice or the need of their trials. "I was doing what I
   believed to be right," such a one will say, and "why should these
   things come upon me?" But the subtle forms of self-life that would ruin
   us, if left undiscovered and unchecked, are often most vigorous in
   those whose outward walk is all that could be desired; and it needs
   sometimes a very sharp discipline to uproot them. And in this fact lies
   hidden, doubtless, the secret of much that is mysterious in the
   dealings of the Lord with the souls of His servants. He loves us too
   much to permit any evil to linger undiscovered and uncured in our
   natures, and He will probe us to the very bottom by His dispensations,
   before He will suffer the hurt of His people to be slightly healed.
   This is not severity, but mercy. For the great object of all the
   discipline of life here, is character-building. We are to be the
   "friends of God" throughout all eternity, and to be His friends means
   something far grander than merely being saved by Him, and requires a
   far deeper harmony with His will. Therefore it is an unspeakable boon
   for us, that He loves us enough to take the necessary pains to make us
   meet for companionship with Himself. How well we know the strength of
   love it requires for us to discipline our children, in order to make
   them what they ought to be, and how often we fail just through a
   selfish weakness. Let us be thankful, then, that we have to do with a
   God who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with any toleration,
   and whose love is so strong that He will not withhold the hand of His
   discipline, until He has purely purged away all our dross, and taken
   away all our tin, and has presented us to Himself a "glorious Church,
   not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing."

   Job, as I have said, shows us the divine process by which all this is
   accomplished. It is "baptism unto death." By all that happened to Job,
   he was brought to a know- ledge of his own heart, and was made to abhor
   himself in dust and ashes. The instrument used was Satan, but the Hand
   that used this instrument was the Lord's. In both cases, when Job's
   possessions were taken, and also when his own body was smitten with
   sores, Satan's power extended only so far as the Lord permitted, and
   not one hair's breadth further. At first the Lord said, "Behold, all
   that he hath is in thy power, only upon himself put not forth thy
   hand," i. 12. And afterward he said, "Behold he is in thine hand; but
   save his life," ii. 6. Therefore, while Satan seemed to do it all,
   there was One behind Satan, who overruled everything, and made it all
   work together to accomplish His purposes of grace toward Job.

   First, the Sabeans fell upon Job's oxen and asses, and the servants who
   were ploughing with them, and destroyed them all. Then, "the fire of
   God" fell from Heaven and consumed his sheep and their shepherds. Next,
   the Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon his camels, and
   carried them away. Then, there came a great wind from the wilderness
   and caused the house to fall upon his children and kill them, i. 13-19.
   And finally Satan smote Job himself "with sore boils from the sole of
   his foot unto his crown," ii. 7. To all these trials were added the
   reproaches and misunderstanding of his friends; until Job's life seemed
   to be utterly ruined, and as though it must end in nothing but
   humiliation and defeat on every hand. But it was only the "seen thing"
   which was thus ruined. The "unseen thing" in the mind of the Lord, was
   the "exceeding and eternal weight of glory "which was to be the outcome
   of this ruin. The outward man, it is true, seemed to perish, but the
   inward man was renewed day by day. And by all that Satan was thus
   permitted to do, Job was brought at last to the place of emptying,
   where the Lord could reveal Himself in glorious fulness.

   The Sabeans, and the Chaldeans, the fire, the wind, and the sore
   sickness, were the agencies employed to accomplish this blessed result.
   And man, judging by "feeble sense," would have seen only these. But the
   curtain has been lifted for us, and we see behind these furls of trial,
   One who sits as a Refiner and Purifier of silver, and who controls and
   guides it all. He knew the heart of His servant Job, and that his
   successful and prosperous career, and even his very righteousness, were
   in danger of building up a subtle form of self-life, that would in the
   end, if unchecked, drag him down into the miry clay. Therefore He used
   Satan to spoil it, that in the spoiling, Job himself might be saved.

   This story of Job is, I believe, enacted over and over in our midst
   now. The righteous suffer, and we cannot tell why. "Mysterious
   providences," as we call them, darken and apparently ruin the lives of
   those who have seemed too good to need such discipline. Even to
   ourselves come afflictions that we cannot understand. And Satan seems
   so busy in the matter, that it is hard to trace the hand of the Lord in
   it at all. But His hand is in it nevertheless, and He overrules
   everything. Not a trial comes except by His permission, and for some
   wise and loving purpose, which, however perhaps, only eternity will
   disclose.

   The Sabeans and the Chaldeans may carry away our property. Fires and
   storms may deprive us of all that we love and value. Sore sickness may
   lay its hand upon us. Friends may misjudge and reproach us. But behind
   them all, our Father sits, measuring out each bitter drop with His own
   unerring wisdom and unspeakable love.

   Earthly parents deal thus continually smith their children. Their
   watchful eyes discover incipient diseases, long before the children
   perhaps feel any uncomfortable symptoms themselves, and they administer
   the needed medicines, often when it seems very mysterious and
   unreasonable to the child. And yet the parent's closet may be full of
   medicines, and all remain untouched for months, if no need is
   discovered. A parent's love is too tender to inflict unnecessary doses,
   and too strong to spare the dose that is needed.

   We may be sure, therefore, that here lies the secret of all that seems
   so mysterious in the discipline of our lives, whether it is outward or
   inward trial. Our loving and wise Physician has discovered in us some
   incipient disease, that He knows will ruin us, if it remains unchecked,
   and He is applying the remedy. Would we stay His hand, even if we
   could? Surely not. For more than anything else we, too, want for
   ourselves soul health; and any remedy that will bring it to us, is more
   than welcome. Above all do we want to have that done for us which was
   done for Job, and to be brought to the end of self as he was, and have,
   as he had, a revelation of God to our souls. We sing, and we mean it,


   "Oh! to be nothing, nothing,

   Only to lie at His feet,

   A broken and emptied vessel,

   For the Master's use made meet.

   Emptied, that He might fill me,

   As forth to His service I go;

   Broken, that so unhindered,

   His life through me might flow.

   But when the Lord takes us at our word, and begins to empty us, and to
   break us, the means He is obliged to use, puzzle us, and seem
   unreasonable, and even often unkind and unjust. No chastening for the
   present can seem joyous to us; but must necessarily be grievous, and we
   ought not to think it "mysterious" that it should be so. We must not
   question, therefore, nor admit the slightest inward rebellion against
   it, but thankfully submit to that which our Lord permits to come, let
   the instrumentality be what it may, whether Satan directly, or the
   wickedness and treachery of men. For not a sparrow falls without our
   Father's notice, and all that He permits to come upon us is meant to
   make us "partakers of His holiness," if only we are rightly exercised
   thereby. For it is the cross, and the cross alone, that brings us out
   of self. And lives that we are apt to call wasted, which have ended in
   sorrow and humiliation, are not really wasted, but are simply being
   stripped of that which separated them from the Lord, and from a perfect
   conformity to His likeness. And that man is happy who goes into the
   next world emptied of self, no matter how painful the humbling may have
   been.

   But Job's friends, as so many now, saw nothing of all this. They
   thought they entirely understood the Lord's dealings, and that what He
   did must simply be a just reward for Job's sins. Eliphaz said,
   "Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were
   the righteous cut off?" iv. 7. Bildad also said, "If thou wert pure and
   upright, surely now He would awake for thee, and make the habitation of
   thy righteousness prosperous," viii. 6. And finally Zophar said, "Know
   therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity
   deserveth," xi. 6. See also xxii. 3-11. These three friends coldly
   reasoned concerning the Lord, that His outward dealings towards men are
   an adequate representation of His relationship with them, and that an
   eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is always His way; therefore,
   because Job was in trouble, it manifested the Lord's disapproval and
   anger. We, who see behind the scenes, know how mistaken was this view,
   for it was really the Lord' s love and approval of Job, that was at the
   secret source of all that had happened. For the Lord said to Satan,
   "Hast thou considered my servant Job that there is none like him in the
   earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and escheweth
   evil?" i. 8. As the potter will cast aside the poorest vases, as not
   worth any further trouble, but will expend all his energies on
   perfecting and beautifying one that is already beautiful, so the Lord
   chose Job out of all the men living on the earth at that time, as being
   the one most worthy of His utmost skill to fashion and mould to His
   will. It is the old rule, "For whosoever hath, to him shall be given,
   and he shall have more abundance." Because Job had so much
   righteousness already, the Lord desired to make him altogether right,
   down to the very bottom; and his trials, therefore, if they had been
   rightly understood, were but a proof of that blessed sort of approval,
   that cannot be satisfied with anything but complete perfection in the
   object of its love. But Job's friends had not such a knowledge of God
   as would have enabled them to dream of this. Their view of Him was the
   shallow outward view of hearts, who have not yet gone into the depths,
   either for themselves or others. They looked upon Him as a hard and
   exacting Master, instead of a loving and tender Father, and construed
   the blessed. justice of One who knows the weakness and the infirmities
   of those He judges, into the stern and revengeful injustice of a
   tyrant, who makes no allowance for human need. They lost sight of the
   Saviour in the Judge. "Behold God will not cast away a perfect man,
   neither will He help the evil-doers," was the whole of their creed. It
   was all works, works, works: "this do, and thou shalt live." And in
   this they were a fitting type of every legalist since, who will not
   believe in any justification but the justification of works.

   Job, conscious of the integrity of his heart, and roused by the unjust
   reproaches of his friends, appealed from them to the Lord. His friends,
   he felt, did not understand him, but he knew the Lord did, and he was
   not afraid to pour out all his heart before Him. The very freedom of
   his complaints and reproaches revealed the depth of his childlike
   confidence in Him. "Oh that I might know where I might find Him! that I
   might come even to His seat! I would order my cause before Him and fill
   my mouth with arguments. I would know the words which He would answer
   me, and understand what He would say unto me. Will He plead against me
   with His great power? No; but He would put His strength in me," xxiii.
   3-6. Job was sure that if he could only see the Lord, and get at His
   reasons , all would be made plain. "Surely I would speak to the
   Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. . . . Then call thou, and I
   will answer: or let me speak and answer thou me. How many are my
   iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgressions. Wherefore
   hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? Wilt thou break a
   leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?" xiii. 3,
   22-24. And through it all he trusted. His mouth was full of complaints
   and of anguish, and even of reproaches; but they were, after all, the
   complaints and the reproaches of a soul who knew that his Redeemer
   lived, and who at the bottom trusted all the time. "Though He slay me,
   yet will I trust in Him," xiii. 15. "For I know that my Redeemer
   liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and
   though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I
   see God: whom I shall see for myself and not another; though my reins
   consume within me." xix. 25-27.

   Job proved moreover, that outward prosperity was no test of
   righteousness, by pointing out the prosperous circumstances of the
   wicked. "The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God
   are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly," xiii. 6. "Their
   seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring
   before their eyes. Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod
   of God upon them," xxi. 7-14. And he showed that if righteousness were
   indeed the test of prosperity, none could be prosperous, because none
   in the sight of the Lord are really righteous. "If I wash myself with
   snow water, and make my hands never so clean, yet shalt thou plunge me
   in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me," ix. 30, 31.

   Notwithstanding all his rebellious complaints, Job knew the Lord so
   much better than his three friends, and set forth His character and His
   ways so much more truly, that the Lord's own verdict, given to Eliphaz
   the Temanite was, "My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy
   two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my
   servant Job has," xlii. 7. The resignation of these three friends to
   Job's sorrows, and their exalting of the Lord's rigid justice in His
   dealings with men, sound to a surface reader far more pious than poor
   Job's rebellious complaints; but the fact remains that the Lord Himself
   was angry with them for not speaking the thing that was right, as He
   declared His servant Job did. And when we look below the surface, we
   get at the secret. Job believed in a Saviour, they believed in a Judge.
   And all the rest was included in this. Job knew something of God's
   love; they were ignorant of it. To Job He was a Father, to them He was
   only a Law-giver. Job trusted Him, although he did not understand Him;
   they thought they understood Him, but were afraid of Him. Theirs was a
   salvation of works; Job's was a salvation of faith. They misjudged the
   Lord, and ascribed to Him a character that He could not but hate.
   Therefore Job, with all his complaints and his questionings, was far
   more acceptable, because through it all, and in spite of it all, he
   trusted. And doubtless this is so still, and the man who trusts, even
   in the midst of utter darkness, and while acknowledging that he cannot
   understand, pleases the Lord far better than the cold reasonings of
   hearts who know Him not, and who attribute to Him therefore
   characteristics that grieve Him. More than anything else, I feel sure,
   He wants our utter confidence, and would far rather we would trust that
   His ways are right, than try to explain them. It is not comprehension
   we desire from our children, but confidence. And we can love even the
   very complaints that come from this confidence, far better than the
   constrained and stiff backwardness that is our homage from those who
   know us not. Love, love, love! is the one universal cry of every heart,
   whether Divine or human, and no homage but love can satisfy.

   But although Job had thus spoken of the Lord that which was right, in
   comparison with his three friends, yet the deep-seated evil of his
   heart came out at last in his self-justifications. Sinful self had been
   conquered in him, but righteous self was mighty. Chapters xxix., xxx.,
   xxxi. bring this to light: "When the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
   when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me; because I delivered the
   poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
   The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused
   the widow's heart to sing for joy. I put on righteousness, and it
   clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem." Job was satisfied
   with himself. He was good, and he knew it, and his heart was lifted up
   within him. This was a very subtle, but a very fatal form of self-life,
   and nothing would have reached it and destroyed it but those very
   "mysterious" dealings, against which poor Job so rebelled. "He was
   righteous in his own eyes," we are told," and "justified himself rather
   than God," xxxii. 2. And this was more disastrous than any other form
   of evil; therefore it must be rooted out at whatever cost. I believe
   that just here many fail, and need sore discipline. Their very
   righteousness and religious success builds up self in them, and nothing
   but a complete overthrow of all will root it out. Sometimes the
   contrast between chapters xxix. and xxx. is experienced now, and
   Christians who once could say with Job, "Unto me men gave ear, and
   waited, and kept silence at my counsel;" afterwards are driven to say
   as he did, "But now am I their song: yea I am their byword. They abhor
   me, they flee from me, and spare not to spit in my face." Such know not
   why this is, and their friends know not, and perhaps reproach them. But
   the Lord knows, and, behind all the wrath of the enemy, He is at work,
   sitting "as a refiner and purifier of silver," watching for the moment
   when the perfect reflection of His own image in the molten metal, shall
   assure Him that the work is accomplished, and the dross is all purged
   away.

   That moment came when Job could say from the depth of a convicted
   heart, "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine
   eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
   ashes," xlii. 5, 6. But it did not come, until the Lord had revealed
   Himself. That which all the reproaches and accusations of his friends
   had failed to do, one sight of God accomplished in a moment. Job had
   prayed that he might but see Him and hear Him speak, and the answer had
   come, bringing with it a revelation of self, which Job could hardly
   have expected, and yet which he found to be the beginning of richest
   blessings. He saw the Lord, but he also saw himself, as he was in the
   Lord's presence, and all his self-righteousness turned into filthy rags
   in an instant.

   Chapters xxxii. to xli. give us this revelation, first through the lips
   of Elihu, and then directly from the mouth of the Lord Himself. These
   chapters are unspeakably grand revelations of the Almighty. They show
   us His infinite greatness and His infinite goodness in such a glorious
   union, as to give to every heart that receives their teaching, an
   eternal rest. His ways are here declared to be ALWAYS RIGHT, let them
   look as they may to the eyes of men. And we are shown, therefore, that
   there is nothing left for us to do but to trust Him: "Although thou
   sayest I shall not see Him, yet judgment is before Him, therefore trust
   thou in Him," xxxv. 14. Yes, trust Him always, everywhere, and through
   everything. We must not question His dealing, for He is too great for
   us to comprehend, and yet too wise to make a mistake. "Behold God is
   great and we know Him not; neither can the number of His years be
   searched out," xxxvi. 26. "God thundereth marvellously with His voice;
   great things doeth He which we cannot comprehend," xxxvii. 5. "Touching
   the Almighty, we cannot find Him out: He is excellent in power, and in
   judgment, and in plenty of justice: He will not afflict." xxxvii. 23.
   "Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty
   pervert judgment." xxxiv. 12. Such was the testimony of Elihu who spoke
   to Job "in God's stead" and on His behalf. And the Lord Himself also
   spoke. "Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, . .
   "Gird up now thy loins like a man: for I will demand of thee and answer
   thou Me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
   Declare, if thou hast understanding.  . . . Wilt thou also disannul my
   judgment? Wilt thou condemn Me that thou mayst be righteous? Hast thou
   an arm like God? Or canst thou thunder with a voice like Him? Deck
   thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory
   and beauty.  . . . Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own
   right hand can save thee." Who can wonder that his rebellious
   reasonings silenced forever by such a revelation of God's greatness and
   his own unspeakable nothingness, Job should exclaim, "Behold I am vile:
   what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth." xl. 4. In
   such a Presence we may well be dumb. But not with fear, only with
   adoring love. "For this God is our God even for ever and ever; He will
   be our guide even unto death."

   Job did, however, at last "answer the Lord," but it was simply by a
   confession of the Divine omnipotence, and his own nothingness. All his
   self-justifications were over forever, and from henceforth he would
   have eyes and ears for none but the Lord and His glory. "Then Job
   answered the Lord and said, I know that Thou canst do everything, and
   that no thought can be withholden from Thee. Who is he that hideth
   counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that I understood
   not, things too wonderful for me which I knew not. Hear I beseech Thee
   and I will speak: I will demand of Thee, and declare Thou unto me. I
   have heard of Thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth
   Thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes." xlii.
   1-6.

   Upon the lap of God's greatness Job could now lie down in perfect
   content, satisfied to be nothing in himself, since he belonged to the
   omnipotent One.


   "For greatness which is infinite, makes room

   For all things in its lap to lie;

   We should be crushed by a magnificence

   Short of eternity.

               *                    *
   *                    *                    *                    *

   "But what is infinite must be a home,

   A shelter for the meanest life,

   Where it is free to reach its greatest growth,

   Far from the touch of strife.

               *                    *
   *                    *                    *                    *

   "Thus doth Thy hospitable greatness lie

   Outside us like a boundless sea;

   We cannot lose ourselves where all is home,

   Nor drift away from Thee.

               *                    *
   *                    *                    *                    *

   "Great God! our lowliness takes heart to play

   Beneath the shadow of Thy state;

   The only comfort of our littleness

   Is that Thou art so great.

   Then on Thy grandeur I will lay me down;

   Already life is heaven for me;

   No cradled child more softly lies than I, --

   Come soon Eternity!"

   One deeply important lesson to be drawn from this experience of Job's
   is this, that all true knowledge of self and abhorrence of self must
   come, not from self-examination, but from beholding the Lord. Until Job
   had his eyes opened to see the Lord, he was very well satisfied with
   himself, and all his self-examination seemed to lead only to
   self-justification. But the moment the Lord was revealed, all was
   changed, and the man, who, while looking at self had seen nothing but
   good, now abhors himself in dust and ashes.

   Self-examination is sometimes extolled among Christians as a most
   commendable and necessary duty; but in my view it is often a very great
   evil. It leads either to self- justification and self-commiseration, or
   else to discouragement and despair. It fills our lives with chapters
   full of the personal pronoun "I" and "my," as Job's was. While the soul
   that looks away from self, and examines the Lord instead, finds its
   mouth filled with His name, and His praises, and His glorious power.
   Compare Job xxix, with Psalm lxxi. In the one it is all, I, my, me. In
   the other it is all, Thou, Thy, Thee. If you will take a pencil and
   mark these respective words underneath, you will see how striking is
   the contrast.

   I feel very sure that the commands to look unto Jesus, to behold His
   glory, to have our eyes ever toward the Lord, mean something
   exceedingly literal. And it is very certain that when we are looking
   unto Jesus, we cannot see ourselves, for if our face is to the One, our
   back will necessarily be to the other. It is by "beholding as in a
   glass the glory of the Lord," that we are to be "changed into His
   image." It is by keeping our eyes "ever toward the Lord," that our feet
   are to be plucked out of the net. It is by looking unto Him, that all
   the ends of the earth are to be saved.

   And practically we know that nothing hinders us more in our christian
   life, than to keep our eyes fixed on our- selves, trying to search out
   evidences of our own goodness and fitness for the mercy of the Lord, or
   tokens of our growth in grace. If we think we find any, then at once we
   are frightened at the danger of pride; and if we do not find any, then
   we are plunged into the depths of discouragement. The true way is to
   give up self at first, as Job did at last, as hopelessly bad, and to
   have no eyes nor thoughts for anything but the Lord and His salvation.
   This, I think, is what the Scriptures mean by self-denial and
   self-crucifixion. It is to say to this "I," "I am a stranger to you,"
   and to refuse to listen for a moment to its pretensions or its claims.

   I am afraid but few will understand this, and fewer still will act upon
   it. Self is so enticing to us, and self-examination such an interesting
   and absorbing occupation, that it is very difficult for us really to
   take in the thought that we are to have no more of it. But
   experimentally I can say, that I never have any peace nor find any
   victory, except when I utterly ignore even the existence of self, and
   turn my eyes and thoughts only on the Lord.

   Job's end was a glorious triumph. The discipline had accomplished its
   work of purification, and the Lord could now bestow upon him double of
   all his blessings. "And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he
   prayed for his friends; also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had
   before," xiii. 10. The turning point was "when he prayed for his
   friends;" and it seems to me that it is because this fact was the sign
   of the inward death to self that had taken place. They had utterly
   misunderstood and misjudged him, and had heaped undeserved reproaches
   upon him. But now that he abhorred himself, he felt no resentment
   towards them, and so partook of the mind of the Lord as to pray for
   those who had thus "despitefully used him and persecuted him." In the
   New Testament, our Lord speaks of this as one of the marks of being
   "perfect even as our Father which is in Heaven is perfect." And I doubt
   not, it is one of the last surrenders of self and self-love made by any
   soul.

   Thus was Job's discipline completed, and he was brought out of self and
   into God. The process bad been painful and mysterious, but the end that
   the Lord had in view, could have been reached by no other means; and
   could Job have seen into the secret counsels of the Lord from the
   beginning, he would doubtless have rejoiced at every blow. The
   "exceeding and eternal weight of glory" worked out for him by what he
   had passed through, a thousand times more than compensated for it all.

   Let us learn the lesson, dear friends; and without a question let us
   accept the sorrows, and trials, and crosses of our lives, directly from
   the hands of our loving Father, as being His own choice for us, in
   order for our being made "partakers of His holiness," no matter what
   instrumentality may be used to bring them upon us. What if they are
   mysterious? The ways of the infinite God must be mysterious to the
   finite creature. Even the ways of earthly parents are often mysterious
   to the minds of their children, and cannot be explained in any terms
   that the children could comprehend, even if the parent should be
   willing to make the explanation. But the day comes, when the children
   have been trained into such maturity of character, as to be able to
   under- stand the needs-be for the process of their training, and to
   understand it by an intuitive perception without any explanation. And
   the day will come to us, I am sure, if we yield ourselves unresistingly
   to our Lord's training, when His ways with us will all be vindicated
   and made glorious, and when we will praise Him for every dispensation
   of His providence, and for every stroke of His rod.


   "God moves in a mysterious way,

   His wonders to perform;

   He plants His footsteps in the sea,

   And rides upon the storm.

   Deep in unfathomable mines

   Of never failing skill,

   He treasures up His bright designs

   And works His sovereign will.


   "Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take!

   The clouds ye so much dread

   Are big with mercy, and shall break

   In blessings on your head.

   Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,

   But trust Him for His grace;

   Behind a frowning providence

   He hides a smiling face.


   "His purposes will ripen fast,

   Unfolding every hour;

   The bud may have a bitter taste,

   But sweet will be the flower.


   Blind unbelief is sure to err,

   And scan His works in vain;

   God is His own Interpreter,

   And He will make it plain."

CHAPTER XIX.

PSALMS.

  THE LIFE HID WITH CHRIST IN GOD.

  Keynote: Col. iii. 1-3.

   THE book of Psalms gives us the resurrection-life of the believer. It
   is the illustration of the latter part of Rom. vi. 4. "Therefore we are
   buried with Him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised
   up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should
   walk in newness of life." In Job we have seen the christian buried
   into death, and here we see him raised up from the dead, to walk, as
   Christ walked, in "newness of life." This book is therefore the natural
   sequence of the book of Job, or the next step in the soul's progress.
   In Job man had been taught to know himself, here he is taught to know
   the Lord. This book shows us human nature in all its weakness, as it is
   seen in God's presence, but reveals at the same moment the
   all-sufficient supply there is in the Lord for its every need. It is
   the necessary and immediate outcome of Job's death to self. It is life
   in God. Its language throughout is, "I am nothing; Christ is all."

   And my feeling is that no heart is fitted to enter fully into an
   understanding of this wonderful book, until it has passed through the
   discipline, and reached the result which the book of Job reveals. None
   but a soul that has come to the end of self and of all self-dependence,
   can enter into the blessed sweetness of the twenty-third Psalm, or
   dwell in the fortress of the ninety-first; for the grace which these
   Psalms reveal, and the blessings they set forth, are all grace and
   blessings for the weak and the helpless, and none but these can
   possibly receive or enjoy them. The man who speaks here, is the man of
   faith, and the life revealed, is the life of trust. "Many there be
   which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. But Thou, Lord,
   art a shield for me; my glory and the lifter up of my head." ii. 2, 3.
   "But mine eyes are unto Thee, O God the Lord; in Thee is my trust;
   leave not my soul destitute." cxli. 8. "It is better to trust in the
   Lord than to put confidence in man: it is better to trust in the Lord
   than to put confidence in princes." cxviii. 8, 9. "O taste and see that
   the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in Him." xxxiv. Such
   are a few out of the numberless declarations of helplessness and of
   trust that are found in this book.

   The Psalms are the expression of the inward feelings produced in the
   heart of each writer by the varied circumstances and events of his
   life. They were written mostly by David, though some of them are
   ascribed to other writers, and the prayer of Moses is included among
   them. But whoever may have been the authors, of each one it is true
   that he was evidently prepared by the Lord, through personal or public
   events, for expressing the mind of the Spirit of God, who "wrote by
   him, and whose words were upon his tongue." And moreover, whoever
   speaks, it is true, as Augustine says in his exposition of this book,
   that "the voice of Christ and His Church are well nigh the only voices
   to be heard." In some instances Christ Himself is the sole speaker, in
   others His people only speak; but generally it is the Head and the
   members together, who "use the harp and utter the song."

   Many of the Psalms refer so manifestly to Christ that they are
   sometimes called Messianic Psalms. And these may be looked upon as a
   sort of diary, as it were, kept by our Lord for the purpose of letting
   His people know a little of the deep, inward emotions He experienced as
   a Man, bearing the awful burden of humanity, partaking of our nature,
   and tempted with our temptations. In other parts of the Bible we have
   the details of His outward life while on earth, and learn what He did,
   and what was done to Him. But here we have the record of what He
   thought and felt, while going through all these.

   The writer of a little book called "Short Meditations on the Psalms"
   says concerning this, "The cries, and tears, and praises of Jesus, His
   solitary hours, His troubles from man, and His consolations in God, all
   these are felt here in their depth and power. What was passing in His
   soul when He was silent as to man, led as a lamb to the slaughter: what
   they who surrounded Him did not hear, we listen to in this wondrous
   Book. His thoughts of men, His worship of God, with all the incense of
   His various and perfect affections, are understood here. The New
   Testament tells us that He prayed and sung, but this Book gives us His
   prayers and songs themselves."

   If this then be indeed true, what blessed intimacy does it declare,
   that our Lord should thus permit us to enter into the wonderful secrets
   of His deepest emotions while living on this earth, for us, and in our
   nature. And I think nothing so makes us realize His actual humanity, as
   to listen to these cries of human suffering and anguish, and to feel
   our hearts thrill over His yearning for human sympathy and
   appreciation.

   One example will illustrate what I mean. In Psalm xxii. we have the
   emotions of our Lord's heart as He hung on the cross, bearing the sins
   of the whole world. The opening verse proves this, "My God, my God, why
   hast Thou forsaken me? why art Thou so far from helping me, and from
   the words of my roaring?" The first sentence of this cry is all that we
   hear in the New Testament, Matt. xxvii. 46; but the Speaker who utters
   that, must also utter all the rest likewise. Some comparison of other
   verses in the Psalm will confirm this. Compare verse 6 with Is. liii.
   3; verses 7, 8, with Matt. xxvii. 39-44; verse 16 with John xx. 25-27;
   verse 17 with Is. lii. 14; verse 18 with Luke xxiii. 34; verse 22 with
   Heb. ii. 11, 12. See also,

   Ps. ii. 7, compared with Matt. iii. 17; xvii. 5; Acts xiii. 33.

   liii. 7.

   Ps. xl. 6-8; li. 16, compared with Heb. x. 5-9; Luke xxiv. 44; John v.
   39.

   Heb. i. 13.

   Ps. xli. 9, compared with John xiii. 18, 25, 26, 27.

   Ps. xlv. 1-17, compared with Luke iv. 22; Heb. i. 8; Is. lxi. 1.

   But besides those Psalms which thus expressly refer to the Lord Jesus,
   there are many others whose praises, desires, hopes and deliverances
   could have in Him alone their truest realization. Only by seeing this,
   I think, can we understand much here written. And only by understanding
   that the desires for vengeance upon His enemies and for the destruction
   of all His foes, is to be interpreted as referring to Christ's great
   enemy, Satan, and all his host of evil spirits, and to the dreadful
   effects of sin in the hearts and lives of men, can we be relieved from
   the painful sense of vindictive cruelty that otherwise would oppress
   many tender hearts in their perusal. The Lord, who has told us to love
   our enemies, and to do good to them that hate us, could surely not do
   otherwise Himself; and I cannot but feel that we must read of His wrath
   as being directed against the sin, and not against the sinner, and His
   vengeance as being poured out upon the cruel Enemy, who carries captive
   His helpless flock, and not upon the poor flock, thus attacked and
   enslaved.

   And, taken in this sense, we, His people and the flock of His pasture,
   can unite with our whole hearts in His cries for vengeance, and can
   rejoice with Him in the promised downfall of every foe. I do not of
   course state this view of mine as an infallibly correct one; but simply
   as the best explanation I can find of all that is so difficult to
   understand in the Psalms, and as containing experimentally much blessed
   help to my own soul. If it is Christ and His Church who speak here, it
   must be that the expressions are such as the Church can unite in,
   without disobeying the commands of her Lord as to her treatment of her
   enemies; and only by taking the view I present can this be done. But I
   feel that the Holy Spirit alone can teach us concerning this.

   The Psalms might be called the heart of the Bible. They lie in the
   midst of it, and express its secret and hidden life. The central verse
   of the whole divine volume is found here, the keystone of the arch, as
   it were; and this verse reveals the point upon which all else turns. It
   is the eighth verse of Ps. cxviii., and reads as follows: "It is better
   to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man." And throughout
   the whole book the universal teaching consists only of different
   changes rung upon this same theme. For it contains, as I have said, the
   heart exercises of the dead and risen man. "Not I, but Christ" is its
   constant language. It is the second stage in the series, beginning with
   Job and ending with the Song of Songs, and is the second stage in the
   experience of every soul, which has been brought by the cross and the
   revelation of God, to the end of self.

   No other dependence but the Lord God of Israel is thought of or
   permitted here. "Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we
   will remember the name of the Lord our God. They are brought down and
   fallen, but we are risen and stand upright," Ps. xx. 7. "Except the
   Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it, except the Lord
   keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain," Ps. cxxvii. 1. And no
   possibility of disappointment to those who do thus trust, is for a
   moment admitted. "They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion,
   which cannot be removed, but abideth forever," cxxv. l . "The Lord
   redeemeth the soul of His servants; and none of them that trust in Him
   shall be desolate," xxxiv. 22. "In God have I put my trust: I will not
   be afraid what man can do unto me," lvi. 11. From beginning to end, the
   voice that speaks here tells of only one Refuge and one Defence. All
   dependence upon self seems to have been taken from him, and, with Paul,
   his realization is throughout, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my
   strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I
   rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon
   me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in
   necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when
   I am weak then am I strong." This experience is not generally the
   first, nor the second, nor even the third step in the christian life.
   Much has to be passed through before this is reached. The deliverance
   out of Egypt, the wilderness journey, the going into the land, the
   failures there, the bondages and the restorations, need often all to be
   experienced according to our measure, before we are ready to come to
   the death of self, as in Job, and to know this life of utter dependence
   upon the Lord. I do not say that all these experiences need to be gone
   through, but that which they teach must, and it seems as though souls
   but seldom have simplicity enough, and faith enough, to learn these
   lessons directly from the Lord, without this outward discipline of
   failure and trial. But whether by the inward crucifixion only, or by
   that also which is outward, in one way or the other, all must come
   here, before the Lord can work in them perfectly the good pleasure of
   His will; and happy shall we be if we can submit ourselves so
   unresistingly and so thoroughly to the forming hand of our Lord upon
   us, as to pass rapidly, and with the ease of a passive and yielding
   soul, through the necessary stages that precede this.

   A poor woman was once scoffed at by an infidel for supposing that she,
   in her weakness and ignorance, could ever travel over the long and
   weary road from earth to heaven. "Ah, master," she replied, "it is a
   very short road, and easily travelled. There are only three steps in
   it." "Three steps," he repeated scornfully, "and what are they?" The
   answer was a memorable one, -- "Out of self, into Christ, and into
   glory." If then to some of my readers the road to present peace and
   victory may look long and hard, let me assure you that after all it
   needs but two of these steps to take you there. Out of self, and into
   Christ! That is all! And that is enough for the deepest experiences and
   the richest blessings. The process that brings this about may be hard
   to flesh and blood, as Job's experience surely was, but the end is
   worth it all. And, although hard, it need not be long, for entire
   consecration and perfect faith will hasten every stage. Job's lesson
   was learned in one year, but he suffered truly the loss of all things
   to reach it. We often are many years learning our lesson, because we
   are not able to bear such rapid and severe strokes of the Divine
   chastising Hand. "Out of self" is a step to be taken by faith, but it
   is also a step to be taken actually and experimentally as well, and the
   Lord's part is to turn our faith into a reality, by His dealings with
   us, both inward and outward. The life of trust looks beautiful to us,
   and we long to live it, but we forget that something must be done
   first. No soul can trust utterly in the Lord, it is manifest, who has
   anything of self left in which to trust, and we must therefore come out
   of the self-life entirely, before we can fully enter into this life hid
   with Christ in God. For it is utter weakness alone that can bring any
   soul to the point of utter trust. And many a "messenger of Satan" may
   have to be sent "to buffet" some of us, before we come here. But if our
   faith will but grasp it now, and if we will but let the Lord work as He
   pleases, without any shrinking or hindrance on our part, who can say by
   what rapid steps He may bring us out into this place of perfect peace,
   nor how soon He may make the language of absolute trust our language
   also.

   In the Hebrew Bible this Book is divided into five books, the first
   ending with Ps. xli.; the second, with Ps. lxxii.; the third, with Ps.
   lxxxix.; the fourth, with Ps. cvi. and the fifth with Ps. cl. Probably
   each of these books would be found to contain some especial line of
   teaching, if our eyes were spiritually enlightened enough to see it.
   But I do not feel prepared to go into this.

   The book of Psalms opens with blessing and ends with praise. The very
   first Psalm introduces us to the man who is the speaker throughout. It
   is the godly man; that is, the man who is like God, "conformed to the
   image of Christ." He not merely obeys the law of the Lord, but his
   delight is in it; it is "written on his heart." Therefore he has found
   the river of living water, and is planted beside it, and whatsoever he
   doeth cannot but prosper.

   The introduction to the Psalms in the Commentary by Canon Cook of
   Exeter, England, says concerning the ideal man of the Book of Psalms
   that "he has these characteristics: unshaken trust in God; entire
   devotion to His service; submission to His will; reliance on His love,
   met by a corresponding affection, a more than filial tenderness; a
   longing for His presence in the sanctuary, and for fruition of that
   presence in Heaven; a thorough appreciation of the righteousness of all
   His dispensations; a confident, nay certain anticipation of a full
   manifestation of His righteousness. Faith, hope, and love assume thus
   their true relative position in the development of the spiritual man."

   And to this godlike man are revealed secrets concerning the Lord and
   His ways, that have not heretofore in the progressive teaching of the
   Bible found any fitting hearer. "The secret of the Lord is with them
   that fear Him; and He will show them His covenant." Only the man who is
   like God, can understand God. And therefore in this book of Psalms, for
   the first time in the progress of the Bible development, does the
   sanctified soul find an adequate expression of its worship and its
   praise. All the previous revelations of the Lord had been but one-sided
   and limited, for there were no hearts prepared to understand any other.
   "As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
   entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for
   them that love Him. But God hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit:
   for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For
   what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is
   in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God.
   Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which
   is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of
   God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom
   teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things
   with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the
   Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know
   them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual
   judgeth all things, yet He himself is judged of no man. For who hath
   known the mind of the Lord, that He may instruct him? But we have the
   mind of Christ." To none but the spiritual man therefore do the secrets
   of this book lie open.

   One of the most blessed of these secrets thus revealed to this "godly
   man," is that concerning the claim of the weak upon the strong. The
   language of his heart is always, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am
   weak." "Turn Thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
   and afflicted." "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for l am in trouble."
   "Attend unto my cry; for I am very low; deliver me from my persecutors,
   for they are stronger than I." This speaker recognizes that the plea of
   weakness and of need is the most effectual plea that the soul can make.
   And do not our hearts also recognize it at once, as the one
   irresistible plea all the world over, as far as the knowledge of the
   true God has gone. Wherever there is weakness, there strength hastes to
   the rescue. In times of danger the weakest are the first cared for. If
   suffering must come, the strong endure it, that the weak may be spared.
   "Noblesse oblige" is the universal Christian law. And the Strong and
   Mighty One who inhabiteth eternity, who is at once the Fountain and the
   Power of this noble necessity, must therefore charge Himself with the
   care of all who are weak and needy, But none can know this, save those
   who have been made "partakers of His divine nature," for none else know
   God. Therefore it is, that, in the book of Psalms for the first time,
   He has fully revealed it; for until this stage is reached, there are no
   eyes that can see it, nor ears that can hear it. But the man who speaks
   here has learned it all. "For the oppression of the poor, for the
   sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord," xii. 5. "The
   Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of
   trouble, ix. 9. "He will regard the prayer of the destitute; He will
   not despise their prayer," cii. 17. The Lord executeth righteousness
   and judgment for all that are oppressed. ciii. 6. He raiseth up the
   poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dung-hill; that
   He may set him with princes. cxiii. 7. "The Lord preserveth the
   simple; I was brought low, and He helped me." cxvi. 6. "The Lord
   upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down."
   cxlv. 14. "The Lord executeth judgment for the oppressed; He giveth
   food to the hungry. The Lord looseth the prisoners; the Lord openeth
   the eyes of the blind; the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down; the
   Lord loveth the righteous; the Lord preserveth the strangers; He
   relieveth the fatherless and the widow." cxlvi. 7-9. "He gathereth
   together the outcasts of Israel. He healeth the broken in heart, and
   bindeth up their wounds." cxlvii. 2.

   Throughout all the varied experiences of this book, it is still always
   this man who knows the Lord, that speaks to us, whether in the voice of
   Messiah, or of His people. And through it all he is led, doubtless by a
   series of deepening and widening revelations, to the paean of
   victorious praise that closes the Book. For only he who knows the Lord,
   and has seen the King in His beauty, could thus extol Him and praise
   His holy name.

   The last six Psalms are a series of continually rising songs of
   thanksgiving, beginning with, "I will extol Thee, my God, O King; and I
   will bless Thy name for ever and ever;" and closing with that
   wonderful, and to me most precious and comforting command, "Let
   everything that hath breath praise the Lord." As Bonar has written
   concerning this, "Praise is now gathered in from every creature; every
   instrument of joy, and gladness, and triumph, and jubilee are summoned
   to sound loud praise; and every voice and heart are engaged to help the
   choir." And another also says concerning it, "Every voice now teems
   with praise; every thought is about praise; every object awakens it;
   every power uses itself to produce it. And no wonder, when we remember
   that we have been ushered into the Kingdom at last. . . . These are the
   days of heaven upon the earth! The kingdom has come; and the will of
   the Blessed One is done here as there. The mystic ladder connects the
   upper and the lower sanctuaries. Praise crowns the scene. The vision
   passes from before us with the chanting of all kinds of music. Man has
   taken the instrument of joy into his hand; but it is only to God's
   glory he strikes it. The creature is happy; God is glorified. Yes,
   praise, all praise! Untiring, satisfying fruit of the lips, uttering
   the joy of creation, and owning the glory of the Blessed One."

   All sorts of instruments are needed in this universal chorus, the
   trumpet, the psaltery, the harp, the stringed instrument, the organ,
   the loud cymbal, and the high-sounding cymbal; the cymbal which can
   give but one note only, being as necessary as the stringed instrument
   which can give many. And all voices are needed here also, the voices of
   young men and maidens, of old men and children; the voices of those who
   are able only to sound one note of praise, as well as of those who can
   sound many. The heart-felt, "Praise the Lord," of the humble
   washer-woman, is as necessary to the grand harmony, as the
   reverberating eloquence of the great preacher, or the melody of the
   gifted singer. For the word is, "Let everything that hath breath praise
   the Lord." Yes, everything, -- "Ye dragons and all deeps; fire and
   hail; snow and vapors; stormy wind fulfilling His word; mountains and
   all hills; fruitful trees and all cedars; beasts and all cattle;
   creeping things and flying fowl; kings of the earth, and all people;
   princes and all judges of the earth; both young men and maidens; old
   men and children;" all must praise Him, for He is good to all.

   And the day will come when this blessed command shall be literally
   obeyed. John saw it, and thus described it in Rev. v. 13, "And every
   creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and
   such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying,
   Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth
   upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever."

   Let us join in this anthem, beloved friends, now and here. Let us
   praise Him, whether we understand Him or not. Let us praise Him, even
   though His ways with us may seem to be too mysterious ever to be
   understood. Let us praise Him out of our weakness, and out of our
   ignorance, and out of our very vileness itself. Let us praise Him that
   we are weak, and ignorant, and covered with infirmity, because this is
   our most irresistible claim upon Him, and because so, and so only, can
   His power rest upon us. Let us praise Him that we are nothing and that
   He is all.


   "Praise ye the Lord.

   "Praise God in His sanctuary:

   "Praise Him in the firmament of His power.

   "Praise Him for His mighty acts:

   "Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.

   "Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet:

   "Praise Him with the psaltery and harp.

   "Praise Him with the timbrel and dance:

   "Praise Him with stringed instruments and organs.

   "Praise Him upon the loud cymbals;

   "Praise Him upon the high-sounding cymbals.

   "Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord.

   "Praise ye the Lord."

CHAPTER XX.

PROVERBS

  THE REDEEMED AND SANCTIFIED SOUL GUIDED BY

  DIVINE WISDOM IN THE DAILY WALKS OF LIFE

  Keynote: James i. 5, 6.

   THE book of Proverbs gives us the application of Divine wisdom to the
   practical details of our walk through the labyrinth of this evil world.
   It is the third step in the developing series concerning
   sanctification, which we are considering. The soul having experienced a
   measure of the death of self and having begun to live the "life hid
   with Christ in God," needs now, according to the prayer of the Apostle
   in Col. i. 9, 10, to be "filled with the knowledge of His will in all
   wisdom and spiritual understanding," that we may "walk worthy of the
   Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and
   increasing in the knowledge of God." For this there must be Divine
   teaching. The life in selfhood depends upon the natural wisdom of the
   human heart for guidance; but the man who is emptied of his own wisdom,
   needs to have Divine wisdom to supply its place, or he will fall into
   all manner of evil. This book, therefore, reveals the Father teaching
   His children how to walk safely and wisely through this world of sin
   and danger. "My son, hear thou the instruction of thy father, and
   forsake not the law of thy mother," i. 8. "Hear, ye children, the
   instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding," iv. 1. "My
   son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding," v.
   1. "Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words
   of my mouth," v. 7. It is not teaching as to how we are to become
   children, but teaching given to us because we are children, that we may
   know how to live and walk as children should. It is essential to
   notice, therefore, that it is not the question of redemption that is
   touched upon in this book; but simply a walk according to the wisdom
   and will of the Lord. And I cannot but believe that Christians would
   make far fewer mistakes in their daily walk, if they were only in the
   habit of more frequently consulting this guide-book provided for them.
   It is surely a great privilege in the labyrinth of this evil world, to
   have a path set before us, marked out by divine wisdom, walking in
   which, we are assured, a practical happiness would be secured to us.
   How eager we are to run for advice to those whom we call wise in human
   affairs, yet how often we neglect to consult this compendium of divine
   wisdom, which would teach us far more unerringly. I feel assured that
   the careful study of this book would enable us to understand the
   Psalmist's rejoicing, when he said: "Thou through thy commandments hast
   made me wiser than mine enemies, for they are ever with me. I have more
   understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my
   meditation. I understand more than the ancients: because I keep thy
   precepts," Ps. cxix. 98-100.

   This book was written by Solomon, of whom we read in I Kings iv. 29-34,
   "And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
   largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea-shore. And
   Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the East
   country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men:
   than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of
   Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. And he spake three
   thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five. . . . And
   there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings
   of the earth which had heard of his wisdom."

   Its object is announced to us in the opening verses: "The proverbs of
   Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel; to know wisdom and
   instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; to receive the
   instruction of wisdom, justice, judgment and equity; to give subtilty
   to the simple, to the young man, knowledge and discretion," i, 1-4. And
   in the closing verse of this chapter we are told what will be the
   blessed results of hearkening to this teaching: "Whoso hearkeneth unto
   me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil." See also
   iv. 20-22; iii. 21-24; vi. 20-23; xxii. 17-21.

   But it is not human wisdom and prudence that are to bring about these
   blessed results. These continually lead astray. It is submission to the
   mind and will of the Lord. We are expressly told to "lean not on our
   own understandings," "but in all our ways acknowledge the Lord and He
   will direct our paths," iii. 4, 5. "For it is written, I will destroy
   the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of
   the prudent. . . . . . Because the foolishness of God is wiser than
   men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men." 1 Cor. 1. 19-29.
   Therefore we must turn from the teachings of our own wisdom, and submit
   ourselves in all things to that wisdom which is from above.

   And for this reason the "fear of the Lord" is put before us here as the
   one grand constraining motive, and power. "The fear of the Lord is the
   beginning of wisdom," ix. 10. "The fear of the Lord prolongeth days,"
   x. 27. "He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord: but he
   that is perverse in his ways despiseth Him," xiv. 2. "By the fear of
   the Lord men depart from evil," xvi. 6. "By humility and the fear of
   the Lord are riches, and honor, and life," xxii. 4. "Favor is
   deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord shall
   be praised," xxxi. 30. In the very first chapter the contrast is drawn
   between the folly of self-will and this spirit of submission to the
   Lord. "For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
   the Lord: they would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof;
   therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled
   with their own devices. . . . But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall be
   quiet from fear of evil," i. 29-33. The different forms of the
   expression "fear of the Lord" or "fear the Lord," are used over one
   hundred and twenty-five times in the Scriptures, and always, in
   connection with richest blessings. It is said of those who "fear the
   Lord" -- that the secret of the Lord is with them; the eye of the Lord
   is on them; the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them; His
   salvation is nigh to them; His mercy is great towards them; He will
   fulfil all their desires; He taketh pleasure in them; and finally that
   there is "no want to them that fear Him." Moreover we are told that it
   is the beginning of wisdom, and the beginning of knowledge; that it
   causes us to hate evil; that it gives us strong confidence; that it is
   a fountain of life; that it is the instruction of wisdom; that it
   brings riches and honor; and that he that feareth the Lord shall come
   forth of every trouble.

   The fear meant in all these passages is not the fear of fright, but the
   fear of love. It is the fear we feel lest we should in any way grieve
   or wound the heart of a beloved one; and is not the fear of the
   consequences to ourselves, but of the sorrow to them. It is a fear
   which can exist only in connection with the highest and tenderest forms
   of love, for all lower forms of affection are indifferent to it, and
   cannot even comprehend it. And therefore I believe that it is only the
   Christian who has passed through the death to self in Job, and has
   learned the life of trust in Psalms, who can understand this sweet and
   constraining "fear of the Lord," which brings forth such results of
   blessedness. Others may perhaps be afraid of Him, but these only can
   fear Him. Others may dread His anger, these alone can fear His grief.
   Only these in fact know that He can be grieved, for they alone know how
   He loves. It is because His love for us is so deep and so tender that
   we are able to grieve Him, for no other affection or passion of the
   soul can be grieved but love. None can truly fear Him therefore who do
   not know something of His love, and none can, I believe, truly follow
   Him who do not know this sweet constraining fear. For His voice is so
   gentle and low, and His will comes to us so much oftener in the form of
   suggestion rather than in that of a command, that unless our love makes
   us fear the slightest neglect of His sweet requirements, or the least
   deviation from His will, we shall often overlook them and miss them
   altogether. No wonder that we are told here that the "fear of the Lord
   is the beginning of wisdom." For he alone is wise who follows the Lord
   whithersoever He leadeth, and such a following is the outcome only of
   this lovely fear.

   The soul in Proverbs is brought here, and consequently we find a great
   deal said about "wisdom" in this Book. The word is used thirty-six
   times, and it is exalted to a place of such great prominence, as to
   lead us to inquire, if it has not a much deeper meaning than at first
   appears. In 1 Cor. i. 24 we are told that Christ is the "wisdom of
   God." Then we read here "The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth,"
   and in John i. 3 we read concerning Christ, "All things were made by
   Him;" and in Heb. i. 2 "By whom also God made the worlds"; and in Heb.
   xi. 3 "the worlds were framed by the word of God." All these passages
   seem to me to point to the thought that Christ is hidden here under the
   figure of wisdom, and that it is a fulfilling of that declaration of
   the apostle, that "He is made unto us wisdom," as well as righteousness
   and sanctification, and redemption. Chapter viii. seems to make this
   even more clear and unmistakable, especially if the marginal references
   are carefully considered. It begins with, "Doth not wisdom cry?" and
   then gives us the words of this cry, "Unto you, O men, I call; and my
   voice is to the sons of men.  . . . The Lord possessed me in the
   beginning of His way, before His works of old.  . . . When He prepared
   the heavens, I was there; . . . when He appointed the foundations of
   the earth. Then I was by Him, as one brought up with Him; and I was
   daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him; rejoicing in the
   habitable parts of His earth; and my delights were with the sons of
   men." Surely to none but Christ can all this apply.

   If by wisdom then in this book is meant Christ, and if the indwelling
   of wisdom means His indwelling, what a lesson we are here taught
   concerning the practical effect of the abiding presence and teaching of
   the Divine Comforter, of whom we are told in the New Testament that He
   is to "lead us into all truth."  "My son, if thou wilt receive my
   words, and hide my commandments with thee; so that thou incline thine
   car unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou
   criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if
   thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
   then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge
   of God. For the Lord giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge
   and understanding. He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous; he is a
   buckler to them that walk uprightly. He keepeth the paths of judgment,
   and preserveth the way of his saints. Then shalt thou understand
   righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. When
   wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy
   soul; discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee; to
   deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh
   froward things; who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways
   of darkness; who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of
   the wicked; whose ways are crooked and they froward in their paths; to
   deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which
   flattereth with her words; which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and
   forgetteth the covenant of her God. For her house inclineth unto death,
   and her paths unto the dead. None that go unto her return again,
   neither take they hold of the paths of life. That thou mayst walk in
   the way of good men and keep the paths of the righteous." ii. 1-20.

   All this, and more, will most certainly be true of that life which is
   ordered by the Lord, and guided by His blessed Spirit; and the path of
   obedience to the divine requirements will always prove to be a path of
   richest blessing.

   Our Lord has declared that His sheep shall "know His voice," but we
   shall need to live very near Him, and have much close communion with
   Him before this can be. For amid the multitude of voices abroad, it is
   not easy to distinguish the Shepherd's voice, unless we have become
   familiar with its sound. At first all voices are alike to the infant,
   and some time must pass before it can learn to distinguish even its
   mother's tones; and doubtless in the learning it makes many mistakes.
   But the time comes when the child knows that dear voice from every
   other, and cannot mistake it, and when the voice of a stranger makes it
   afraid. And for us also, if we but follow on to know unwaveringly,
   "applying our hearts" as our book says, and "inclining oar ears,"
   "seeking for it also as for silver and for hid treasure," the time will
   surely come when we likewise shall be able to distinguish the
   Shepherd's voice, and shall "flee from the voice of a stranger."

   Not long ago a friend related to me the following story. A farmer,
   wishing to purchase some sheep, made a selection from the flocks of a
   neighbor, and started to drive them home. But he found it impossible to
   induce a single sheep of them all to leave its owner's sheep-fold by
   any force or persuasion. In despair he called upon the shepherd, who
   told him the trouble was that the sheep did not know his voice, and
   going outside of the fold himself, the owner of the sheep stood and
   called them, when immediately every one bounded eagerly and joyfully
   out. He walked on, the sheep following him through strange and unknown
   roads, calling out continually to let them know that he was their
   leader, until he had secured them safely in the sheep-folds of their
   new owner. No doubt in time these sheep would learn to know the voice
   of the shepherd who from this time had the care of them, but until they
   had learned it, they could not follow him willingly, nor yield a ready
   obedience to his commands.

   Subjection to a voice is one of the sweetest ways of learning to know
   it, and experimentally we shall find that each time we obey the voice
   of our Shepherd, when we do recognize it, it will become easier for us
   to distinguish it the next time. As our book tells us, "My son, keep
   thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: Bind
   them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. When
   thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee;
   and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. For the commandment is
   a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way
   of life:" vi. 20-23.

   We must therefore bow our necks to the yoke of this Divine guidance, if
   we would learn to walk in the true "way of life." But none can do this
   fully, I believe, who have not learned the previous lessons of our
   series. Self must be dead, and Christ must be known to be all in all,
   before the soul can everywhere and always take His yoke upon it, and
   learn of Him. Our own wisdom must have failed utterly, before we can
   submit in all things to Divine wisdom. And therefore but few
   comparatively reach this stage. Believers are crying out everywhere,
   "Oh! that I might know the Shepherd's voice!" But they shrink frown the
   steps that must be taken in order to learn it. Their bemoanings are
   like the bemoanings of Ephraim, "Thou hast chastised me, and I was
   chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke." For there is no
   other way. If we would walk where Christ walks, we must have on His
   yoke, and if we will not take it on lovingly and gladly, He will be
   compelled to put it upon us with chastisements and severity. A farmer's
   wife once said to me, that it had often been a great lesson to her, to
   watch the young oxen being trained to wear the yoke, and to see how
   much severe discipline was needed, which might all have been spared,
   had the animals but been docile enough to have bowed their necks to the
   yoke willingly and without resistance.

   To take the yoke of Christ upon us, means, I think that we give up
   utterly our own freedom of will to Him, and consent to be in all things
   led and guided by His voice. This voice will be made known to us, I
   believe, in three ways; through the Scriptures, through providential
   circumstances, and through a divine conviction produced in the soul by
   the Holy Spirit; and we have a right to ask that we may clearly
   distinguish it, before being required to act. But when once we know it,
   nothing but obedience will do, and to the truly obedient soul the yoke
   proves to be indeed an easy one, and the burden light.


   "Dole not thy duties out to God,

   But let thy hand be free;

   Look long at Jesus, His sweet blood,

   How was it dealt to thee?

   "The perfect way is hard to flesh,

   It is not hard to love;

   If thou wert sick for want of God,

   How swiftly wouldst thou move!

   "No outward helps perfection needs; --

   Keep thy heart calm all day,

   And catch the words the Spirit there

   From hour to hour may say.

   "Then keep thy conscience sensitive;

   No inward token miss:

   And go where grace entices thee; --

   Perfection lies in this.

   "Be docile to thy unseen Guide,

   Love Him as He loves thee;

   Time and obedience are enough,

   And thou a saint shalt be."

   The "voice of the stranger" is warned against in this book under the
   figure of the "strange woman," whose house we are told "inclineth unto
   death" and "whose guests are in the depths of hell," ii 16-19; v. 3-5;
   ix. 13-18. Some have thought this "strange woman" means the Babylon of
   Revelation, that "great whore which did corrupt the earth with her
   fornication," and which is plainly a corrupt form of religion; Rev.
   xix. 2. See also Rev. xvii. 1-6, and xviii. But whether this be so or
   not, the warnings against this "strange woman" apply to any form of
   evil that draws away the heart from the voice of heavenly wisdom,
   whether this divine voice is heard inwardly in the soul, or comes to us
   outwardly in the written word of our Lord, or in His providential
   dealings.

   The practical teaching of divine wisdom given us in this book, reaches
   into many details of private and public life, and is worthy of far more
   careful study than it generally receives, teaching us also that nothing
   is too insignificant for His notice or advice. We are shown here what
   things are an abomination to the Lord. "These six things doth the Lord
   hate; yea, seven are an abomination unto Him: a proud look, (or, as the
   margin has it, haughty eyes,) a lying tongue, and hands that shed
   innocent blood, an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that
   be swift in running to mischief, a false witness that speaketh lies,
   and he that soweth discord among brethren," vi. 16-19. Also in other
   verses we are told that "they of a froward heart," a "false balance,"
   "divers weights and divers measures," the "sacrifice of the wicked,"
   the "way of the wicked," the "thoughts of the wicked," "every one that
   is proud in heart," he that justifieth the wicked, and he that
   condemneth the just," all these are declared to be an "abomination to
   the Lord."

   We are also taught what are the things likely to bring us into outward
   trial and difficulty. and are warned against them; and are encouraged
   in paths that will lead to outward prosperity and peace. I cannot go
   into these details here. But I would repeat again, what I said at
   first, that this book is a blessed gift of wisdom to us, who feel
   ourselves so far from wise and that it is great grace in our Lord to
   have condescended to apply His wisdom, thus, to the details of our
   lives, in the midst of this world's confusion, because of sin.

   Let us come to it, then, beloved readers, with receptive and submissive
   hearts, prepared to yield a glad obedience to what we find here; and
   prepared also to listen more attentively and obediently than ever to
   the inward voice as well, relying with perfect confidence upon our
   Lord's own promise, "When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will
   guide you into all truth;" and "He shall teach you all things, and
   bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you."
   This blessed doctrine of the direct and personal teaching and guiding
   of the Holy Spirit has been too much neglected in the Church, and great
   loss has been the result. But that it is a glorious reality, and within
   the reach of even the most unlearned believer, thousands of witnesses
   can testify, who have given themselves up to a "walk in the Spirit,"
   and who have found themselves led, perhaps by ways they knew not, into
   the green pastures and beside the still waters, where the little flock
   who follow the good Shepherd whithersoever He leadeth, always feed.
   "For wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
   peace." And the heart that "wholly follows" the Lord, as Caleb did,
   shall, like him, enter into the possession of an inheritance, which
   none others can conquer. Joseph Cook says, "Whenever your conscience is
   made fully supreme, its yoke by irresistible natural law will transform
   itself into a crown. This constant experience you will have at every
   fork of the way; and rising through such continual steppings, we may,
   even in our present low estate, approach the bliss of the upper ranges
   of being, even of those who have never sinned, and of that Nature which
   was revealed on earth once as the fullness of Him that filleth all in
   all."

   If any doubt the truth of this, let them try the experiment of an utter
   yielding to God at every step of their way, and I feel sure they will
   be amazed at the rapidity with which their souls will climb toward
   these wondrous heights of divine fellowship and bliss. Let our
   obedience but keep pace with the outmost verge of our light, and our
   happiness will reach even here and now, to the joys of the "upper
   ranges of being," and a blessed foretaste of Heaven will be granted us.
   But without this utter surrender, we cannot expect to advance in the
   divine path; and the lesson of Proverbs therefore must necessarily be
   learned, before the soul can take the next step in its progress, and
   come to know the vanity of the world and all it has to give, as in
   Ecclesiastes.

   "Happy, therefore, is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that
   getteth understanding: for the merchandise of it is better than the
   merchandise of silver and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more
   precious than rubies, and all things thou canst desire are not to be
   compared unto her."

CHAPTER XXI.

ECCLESIASTES.

  THE VANITY OF ALL EARTHLY THINGS; AND THEIR

  POWERLESSNESS TO SATISFY THE REDEEMED SOUL.

  Keynote: 1 John ii. 15-17.

   THIS book shows us the utter vanity of the world and all it contains,
   apart from God. It is the illustration of those words of our Lord to
   the woman of Samaria, "He that drinketh of this water shall thirst
   again." The world is here searched for an object to satisfy the heart,
   but in vain. All is proved to be only vanity and vexation of spirit. It
   is the fourth stage of the developing series concerning sanctification,
   and shows us the soul completely delivered from the love of the world
   and the things that are in the world. It is that inward escape from the
   world's allurements, which comes from the discovery of its utter
   hollowness and vanity. It is the heart made "dead" to its power. Many
   give up the world outwardly, who yet long after it inwardly. But this
   man hates it. It has no longer any charms for him. In the marvelous
   maturing of his inward life, he has outgrown it. Its greatest gifts are
   but childish toys to him, and to go back to them would be for a man to
   return to the rattles and rings of his babyhood. This is the only true
   deliverance, for it weans the heart. It is the divine way of cutting
   the cords and breaking the bonds that chain the soul to earth, and of
   setting it free to soar into infinity. When we love the world, it is
   hard to give it up, but when it has lost its charms, it drops from our
   hands unheeded. And if our affections are thus weaned from earthly
   things, it is easy then to set them on heavenly things. Nor can a heart
   that has once tasted of divine joys, be ever again satisfied with the
   joys of earth.

   This book gives us the experience of the man who has found the wisdom
   spoken of in the preceding book of Proverbs, and who has tried the
   world by this wisdom, and has proved it all to be only vanity of
   vanities. "I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem: and I gave
   my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that
   are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of
   man to be exercised therewith. I have seen all the works that are done
   under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit." i.
   12-14. It is the wise man trying the world by his wisdom, for others
   less wise, that he "might see what was that good for the sons of men,
   which they should do under heaven all the days of their life." The
   effect of this trial was to prove that all was "vanity and vexation of
   spirit, and there was no profit under the sun." And yet this man had
   tried the world at its brightest and best under the most favorable
   possible circumstances for proving its worth. "I made me great works,"
   he says; "I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: I made me
   gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of
   fruits: I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
   bringeth forth trees: I got me servants and maidens, and had servants
   born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small
   cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: I gathered me also
   silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the
   provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of
   the sons of men as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. So I was
   great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem:
   also my wisdom remained with me. And whatsoever mine eyes desired I
   kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart
   rejoiced in all my labor: and this was my portion of all my labor." But
   at the end of it all his sentence concerning it still was: "Then I
   looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor
   that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of
   spirit, and there was no profit under the sun." ii. 1-11.

   This book gives us an insight into what the world is to a really
   sanctified heart; and it has been placed, I believe, by our loving
   Father in the Bible, as a beacon-light to warn us, before we enter upon
   them, from the seducing temptations of the world. But for this book of
   experience, we might have been tempted perhaps to think that there must
   be some satisfying portion somewhere in earthly things, although we
   ourselves have never found it. But here a man speaks who had tried
   everything, and who is so sure he had left no earthly joy untried, that
   he asks confidently, "What can the man do that cometh after the king?
   even that which hath been already done." ii. 12. No one can ever again
   be in circumstances more favorable for earthly happiness than was this
   man, and yet he says, from the stand-point of experimental knowledge,
   that "all is vanity." He has tried it for everyone who was to come
   after him, and, if we would but believe his testimony, and would
   renounce the world without trying it for ourselves, we would none of us
   need to go through the same disappointing experiment.

   It may seem to some a sad thing that the world should be so
   unsatisfactory. But when we understand the reason of it, and the
   blessed result, we will surely praise the Lord with all our hearts that
   He has so arranged it. For He has commanded us to hate the world and to
   forsake it, and how could we obey Him if it was attractive and
   satisfying? If there should be poison in our food, would we not be
   thankful if it had so bitter a taste as to make it impossible for us to
   eat it? And, since there is a fatal poison in the world to all who love
   it, shall we not be thankful that the Lord has given it such a bitter
   taste as to make it too nauseous to be enjoyed? If we understood this,
   dear friends, I think we should not grieve so bitterly over the
   spoiling of our pleasant pictures, nor think it so mysterious that
   disappointments should come. For it is a grand victory not to love the
   world; and the soul that has gained this victory finds itself set in a
   large place, and cannot but be thankful for whatever disappointment may
   have brought it there.

   And not only is the soul here set free from the seductions of outward
   earthly things, but even also from the more subtle snares of earthly
   wisdom. There are many who scorn the physical enjoyments of earth in
   the shape of riches or tangible pleasures, who yet take refuge in the
   exercise of wisdom and knowledge. But these also are here shown to be
   vanity and vexation of spirit. "I communed with mine own heart, saying,
   Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all
   they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
   experience of wisdom and knowledge. And I gave my heart to know wisdom
   and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation
   of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
   knowledge increaseth sorrow," i. 16-18. "Then said I in my heart, As it
   happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then
   more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also as vanity," ii. 15.

   Man is made for a divine destiny, and nowhere short of this can he be
   satisfied. It is not that he ought not to be, but he cannot. This is in
   the eternal nature of things. A learned man cannot be satisfied in the
   company of fools, neither can a man of culture and refinement be happy
   with coarse and brutal associations. They ought not, it is true, but
   there is something deeper than ought in the case, they cannot. And the
   soul that has tasted of divine wisdom, can never be happy with anything
   on a lower level.


   "God only is the creature's home;

   Though rough and strait the road,

   Yet nothing else can satisfy

   The soul that longs for God.

   Oh, utter but the name of God

   Down in your heart of hearts,

   And see how from the world at once

   All tempting light departs."

   Therefore upon all that man tries of earthly things there can be but
   the one same universal sentence which is here repeated over and over,
   "This also is vanity." See i. 2, 14; ii. 1, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23,
   26;   iii. 19; iv. 4, 8, 16; v. 10; vi. 2, 9; vii. 6; viii. 10, 14; xi.
   8; xii. 8.

   But viewed frown this earthly standpoint, all is not only seen to be
   vanity, but utter confusion as well. Apart from the thought of God, all
   is darkness beyond this present life, and all is mystery here. Neither
   wisdom nor reason can explain the sad perplexity of life. Everything
   seems to go wrong. Wickedness triumphs, and righteousness suffers loss,
   and there is no explanation. "When I applied mine heart to know wisdom,
   and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is
   that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes): Then I beheld
   all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is now
   done under the sun: because though a man labor to seek it out, yet he
   shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet
   shall he not be able to find it," viii. 16, 17. "I returned, and saw
   under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
   strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of
   understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance
   happeneth to them all," ix, 11. "All things come alike to all: there is
   one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the
   clean, and to the unclean: to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
   sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that
   sweareth, as he that feareth an oath," ix. 2. "So I returned, and
   considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold
   the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on
   the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no
   comforter," iv. 1.

   It is the lesson of Job repeated here, that the outward works of the
   Lord are not an adequate expression of His heart towards us, and that
   therefore nothing is left to us but the sublime silence of faith, which
   can calmly await the day of His explanations, and can meanwhile sit
   down contentedly before the greatest mysteries. To judge of things by
   what we see, there seems often to be no God. But faith can always claim
   His presence.


   "Thrice blest is he, to whom is given

   The instinct that can tell,

   That God is on the field, when He

   Is most invisible."

   *          *          *          *          *

   "God's glory is a wondrous thing,

   Most strange in all its ways,

   And, of all things on earth, least like

   What men agree to praise.

   "As He can endless glory weave

   From what men reckon shame,

   In His own world He is content

   To play a losing game.

   "Muse on His justice, downcast soul;

   Muse, and take better heart;

   Back with thine angel to the field

   And bravely do thy part.

   "God's justice is a bed, where we

   Our anxious hearts may lay,

   And, weary with ourselves, may sleep

   Our discontent away.

   "For right is right, since God is God,

   And right the day must win;

   To doubt would be disloyalty,

   To falter would be sin."

   Our book therefore, not only teaches us the vanity and confusion of all
   things "under the sun;" but it also lets us know that there is one way
   of relief, one outlet from the oppressive sense of universal emptiness
   and mystery, and that this is to be found in the fear of the Lord and
   in doing His will. There are "bags which wax not old" and treasures
   which do not fail, and these are bestowed upon the Lord's faithful
   servants. All other things are vain, but "he that feareth the Lord
   shall come forth of them all," vii. 18. Therefore the lesson of our
   book is all summed up at last in one short sentence, "Let us hear the
   conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments:
   for this is the whole duty of man," xii. 13.

   All that is really necessary is declared to us in this one sentence. We
   cannot understand the world, we cannot find any comfort in it; it is
   all hopelessly empty and mysterious. But the Lord reigns, and holds the
   clue; and to fear Him and keep His commandments is the only thing
   needed to make everything straight. Obedience is the golden key to
   every mystery. They that do His will, shall always come, sooner or
   later, to know of the doctrine; and to the obedient soul, God, with His
   infinity, fills every void. A walk with Him is a walk through a region
   of grandeur, and life is transfigured before us. Let us praise Him,
   then, that the one only thing which is declared to be our duty, is also
   the one only thing which it is possible for us to do, or the doing of
   which can bring us any abiding peace or rest. For the "world passeth
   away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth
   forever."

   A dear little girl of my acquaintance, whose life was the truest
   picture of childlike faith I ever saw, said one morning, as she kneeled
   in prayer, "Dear Lord, I thank Thee that I have nothing to do all day
   to-day, but just to mind." Nothing to do but to mind! Ah! this is the
   blessed secret! We need not plan, we need not worry; we need only to
   obey, and all will come right.

   Such is the lesson of our book. It is the judgment of heavenly wisdom
   on all that happens "under the sun," and the decision of that wisdom as
   to the only relief from it all. It shows us the world as it looks to
   the man who has died to self, as in Job, and who is living the
   resurrection life, as in Psalms, and has been taught the "wisdom which
   is from above," that belongs to that life, as in Proverbs. It is the
   fourth stage in the progressive steps of sanctification given us in the
   series of books beginning with Job and ending with the Song of Songs:
   and is the necessary prelude to the beautiful lesson of the Canticles.
   Here the world is searched to find an object to satisfy the heart, but
   in vain. There that Object is found. And until our hearts have learned
   the lesson of Ecclesiastes we shall not be prepared to receive the
   lesson of that wondrous mystic Song.

   Hast thou learned this lesson, dear reader? Is the world "vanity of
   vanities" to thee, or has it yet charms to attract thee and win thy
   heart? Thou hast heard the command, "Love not the world, neither the
   things that are in the world." Hast thou obeyed it? If not, I would
   sound in thy ears the accompanying sentence: "If any man love the
   world, the love of the Father is not in him." The love of the Father
   may be believed in and trusted by many christians, who yet have never
   known it to be shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and it is
   this inward experience and manifestation of it that is meant here. In
   the very nature of things this way of divine love cannot be known by
   the heart that loves the world; and therefore it is that the experience
   of Ecclesiastes must be realized before the Song of Songs can be
   reached.

   May the Lord Himself teach and lead us here!

CHAPTER XXII.

THE SONG OF SONGS.

  DIVINE UNION, OR THE LOVE OF CHRIST AND THE CHURCH.

  Keynote: 2 Cor. xi. 2.


   "Oh! bless thee, bless thee, treacherous world

   That thou dost play so false a part;

   And drive, like sheep into the fold,

   Our loves into our Saviour's heart."

   THE Song of Songs is in wonderful contrast to the book of Ecclesiastes.
   There the world is searched for an object to satisfy the affections of
   the sanctified heart, but it is not found. Here the Object is revealed,
   and the heart has entered into the richest enjoyment of it. This little
   book gives us the fifth and last stage in the developing series
   concerning sanctification, and is the consummation of all the soul's
   deepest longings. It can only be understood, I believe, by those who
   have passed through all the preceding stages. Self must die, as in Job,
   and the hidden resurrection life must be known, as in Psalms divine
   wisdom must be submitted to, as in Proverbs; and the world must be
   tried by this wisdom, and found to be utter vanity, as in Ecclesiastes;
   before the heart is prepared for the experience set forth in this
   mystic song. Through emptying to fulness is always the Divine way. And
   the heart must have learned for itself, the hollowness of all earthly
   things, before it is able to receive that fulness of the love of
   Christ, and to realize that conscious union with Him, which are
   typified in this wonderful little book. The world must go out, before
   Christ can come in. And in Ecclesiastes, the departure of the world has
   prepared the way for this allegorical picture of Christ's incoming. He
   that drinketh of the water the world giveth, shall thirst again, but he
   that drinketh of this water, shall never thirst.

   This Song would seem to be the Old Testament typical expression of the
   truth set forth in Eph. v. 2333 of the wondrous union of Christ and His
   Church. "For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the
   head of the church: and He is the Saviour of the body. Therefore as the
   church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own
   husbands in every thing. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also
   loved the church, and gave Himself for it: that He might sanctify and
   cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. That He might present
   it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
   such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. So ought
   men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife
   loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth
   and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: for we are members of
   His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. For this cause shall a man
   leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and
   they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak
   concerning Christ and the church."

   The same figure is also used in many other places in Scripture to
   express this glorious oneness. The Church is called "the Bride, the
   Lamb's wife;" the Lord Jesus speaks of Himself as the "Bridegroom;" and
   the moment of the final union in Heaven is called the "marriage supper
   of the Lamb." In answer to the question as to why His disciples did not
   mourn or fast, Jesus said: "Can the children of the bride-chamber mourn
   as long as the Bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the
   Bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in
   those days." Matt. ix. 15, see also Mark ii. 19, 20, and Luke v. 34,
   35. John the Baptist speaks of Christ as the Bridegroom, when asked who
   he himself was. "Ye yourselves bear me witness," was his answer, that
   I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him. He that
   hath the bride is the Bridegroom; but the friend of the Bridegroom,
   which standeth and heareth Him, rejoiceth greatly because of the
   Bridegroom's voice: this, my joy, therefore, is fulfilled. John iii.
   28, 29. Our Lord Himself speaks of His own return as the return of the
   Bridegroom, "Then" (that is in the day of His return) "shall the
   kingdom of Heaven be likened to ten virgins which took their lamps and
   went forth to meet the Bridegroom. . . . While the Bridegroom tarried,
   they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made,
   Behold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him. . . . And while
   the foolish went to buy, the Bridegroom came; and they that were ready
   went in with Him to the marriage: and the door was shut. . . . Watch,
   therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man
   cometh." Matt. xxv. 1-13. And, finally, in the Revelation of John, the
   voice of the great multitude is heard to say: "Alleluia! for the Lord
   God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad, and rejoice, and give honor to
   Him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made
   herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in
   fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of
   saints. And He saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
   unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are
   the true sayings of God." Rev. xix. 7, 8. Also John describes what he
   saw, "And I, John, saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
   God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. . . .
   And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven
   vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come
   hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife." Rev. xxi. 2, 9.

   In the Old Testament, also, this figure of the Bridegroom and the Bride
   is prophetically used. "Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither
   shall thy land any more be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called
   Hephzi-bah, and thy Land Beulah: for the Lord delighteth in thee, and
   thy land shall be married. For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so
   shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the
   bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee." Is. 62: 4, 5.  And again in
   Hosea ii. 14-20. "And it shall be at that day, saith the Lord, that
   thou shalt call me Ishi" (that is my husband); "and shalt call me no
   more Baali" (that is my Lord). "For l will take away the names of
   Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their
   name. . . . And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will
   betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in
   loving-kindness and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in
   faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord." And yet again in Isaiah
   54:5, is the assertion made with unmistakable clearness, "For thy Maker
   is thy husband; the Lord of hosts is His name; and thy Redeemer, the
   Holy One of Israel; the God of the whole earth shall He be called."

   Such, then, is the mystery of the soul's divine Bridegroom, and the
   Song of Songs tells us about it. Well may it be called the Song of
   Songs, for never before nor since has any song, containing such a
   wondrous story as this been sung by human lips. It is the revelation of
   a love that does indeed pass knowledge: the love between Christ and
   the soul of the believer. It is the fulfilling of the Lord's own
   marvellous words: "As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you."

   But it is not every Christian heart that can sing this song. Origen
   says, concerning it: "As we have been taught by Moses that there are
   not only holy places, but a Holy of holies, that there are not only
   Sabbaths, but Sabbaths of Sabbaths, so now we are taught, by the pen of
   Solomon, that there are not only songs, but a Song of songs. Blessed
   truly, is he who enters into the holy place, but more blessed he who
   enters into the Holy of holies. Blessed is he who keepeth the Sabbath,
   but more blessed he who keepeth the Sabbath of Sabbaths. So, too,
   blessed is he who understands songs, and sings them, for no one does
   sing save on high festivals; but much more blessed is he who sings this
   "Son of songs." And as he who enters into the holy place, still needs
   much ere he is able to proceed into the Holy of holies; and as he who
   keeps the Sabbath enjoined on the people by the Lord, yet wants many
   things that he may keep the Sabbath of Sabbaths, so, too, he who
   traverses all the songs of Holy Writ, finds it no easy thing to ascend
   to the Song of songs. Thou must needs go out of Egypt, and issued
   thence, cross the Red Sea, that thou mayest sing the first song,
   saying: "I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously."
   Ex. xv. And even though thou mayest have sung this first song, thou art
   still far from the Song of songs. Pass spiritually through the
   wilderness, till thou comest to the well which the princes dug, that
   allow mayest there sing the second song. Afterwards approach the
   borders of the Holy Land, and, standing on Jordan's bank, sing the song
   of Moses: "Give ear, oh ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O
   earth, the words of my mouth." Yet again, thou needest soldiers, and
   the inheritance of the holy land, and that Deborah should prophesy to
   thee and judge thee, that thou mayest utter that hymn also, which is
   contained in the book of Judges: "Praise ye the Lord for the avenging
   of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves." Ascending to
   the record of the Kings, come to the song when David escaped from the
   hands of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul, and said: "The
   Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer." Thence thou must
   reach Isaiah, that thou mayest say with him: 'I will sing to my
   Beloved, a song of my Beloved touching His vineyard.' And when thou
   hast traversed all these, go up yet higher, that thou mayest, with pure
   soul, cry unto the Bridegroom this Song of songs."

   For in truth, this song utters holy secrets, which only God's Spirit
   can teach, and which none but the deeply spiritual can understand. And
   these secrets are the secrets of an infinite and Divine love. St.
   Bernard says concerning it, "This song excels all other songs of the
   Old Testament; they being, for the most part, songs of deliverance from
   enemies, Solomon for such had no occasion. In the height of glory,
   singular in wisdom, abounding in riches, secure in peace, he here, by
   Divine Inspiration, sings the praises of Christ and His Church, the
   grace of holy love, the mysteries of the Eternal Marriage; yet all the
   while, like Moses, putting a veil before his face, because at that time
   there were few or none that could gaze upon such glories. . . .  This
   song is not heard without; it is not sounded forth in public concourse;
   she only hears its notes who sings it, and He for whom it is sung --
   the Bridegroom and the Bride."

   In the very latest Commentary on the Bible, edited by Canon Cook, of
   Exeter, Eng., we find in the Introduction to the Song of Solomon this
   passage, "And shall we then regard it as a mere fancy which for so many
   ages past has been wont to find in the pictures and melodies of the
   Song of Songs, types and echoes of the actings and emotions of the
   highest Love, of Love Divine in its relations to Humanity; which if
   dimly discerned through their aid by the Synagogue, have been amply
   revealed in the Gospel to the Church. Shall we not still claim to trace
   in the noble and gentle history thus presented, foreshadowings of the
   infinite condescensions of Incarnate Love? -- that Love which first
   stooping in human form to visit us in our low estate in order to seek
   out and win its object, Ps. cxxxvi. 23, and then raising along with
   Himself a sanctified Humanity to the heavenly places, Eph. ii. 6, is
   finally awaiting there an invitation from the mystic Bride to return to
   earth once more and seal the Union for Eternity.

   It is manifest from all these extracts, that the spiritual mind of the
   Church in all ages has received this Song as the expression of a mystic
   Divine union, and that as such it has brought richest blessings to many
   childlike souls.

   There are many forms of love between heart and heart, there is filial
   love, and brotherly love, and parental love and the love of friendship.
   But besides all these, and different from them all, there is the love
   of espousals, and it is of this sort of love our little book speaks. It
   is true that we do love our Lord as children love a parent, as brethren
   love brethren, as a friend loves a friend. But all these do not after
   all completely meet our need, nor fill our capacity. Our hearts are
   susceptible of a more absorbing affection than any of them, and Christ
   is the offered Object of it. He has loved us Himself with a love
   passing knowledge, and He wants our utmost love in return. He wants us
   to be one with Him, as He is one with the Father. He has bought us for
   Himself at infinite cost and pains, and now He seeks to win our whole
   soul's devotion. It is intended that there should be an interchange of
   affection between our hearts and His. We love Him, it is true, because
   He first loved us, but we are commanded nevertheless to love Him
   absorbingly, unutterably. supremely. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
   with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might," is
   the "first and great commandment." And when we have been enabled to
   obey this command, and have found our hearts possessed by this supreme
   affection, we need some fitting expression of it, such as we find here.
   "Let Him kiss me with blue kisses of His mouth; for Thy love is better
   than wine." "As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
   Beloved among the sons. I sat down under His shadow with great delight,
   and His fruit was sweet to my taste. He brought me to the banqueting
   house, and His banner over me was love. Stay me with flagons, comfort
   me with apples: for I am sick of love. His left hand is under my head,
   and His right hand doth embrace me. I charge you, O ye daughters of
   Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not
   up, nor awake my love till He pleases." "My Beloved is white and ruddy,
   the chiefest among ten thousand. . . .  His mouth is most sweet; yea,
   He is altogether lovely. This is my Beloved, and this is my Friend, O
   daughters of Jerusalem." i. 3-7 and v. 10-16. Such is the impassioned
   language of this mystic song.

   The soul here makes her boast in the Lord's love. She does not refuse
   to listen to the tenderest expressions of it, nor to tell out her own
   deepest emotions. "My Beloved is mine, and I am His," is the underlying
   consciousness through it all, which warrants the most blessed
   confidence and freedom.

   An English writer, whose name I do not know, has written a very
   delightful book entitled "Introduction to the Canticles," * in which he
   says: -- "The Canticles do not give us the ways of filial affection,
   nor of the affection due to a benefactor. But they give us, I believe,
   the actings of the love of espousals, in both Christ's heart and ours.
   The joy of hearing the Bridegroom's voice, I may say, is fulfilled here
   in the heart of the saint, as it was in the soul of John the Baptist, .
   . . . It is the love which warrants personal intimacy of the nearest
   and dearest kind that breathes in this lovely little book; and if these
   affections be not understood as passing between Christ and the saint,
   if we do not, without reserve, allow this satisfaction in each other,
   our souls will not enter into much of the communion which the
   Scriptures provide for. . . . Love takes different forms in the heart
   and regards its object in many different ways; but the love of which
   this Song speaks has a glory peculiarly its own. It warrants the
   deepest intimacies. There is no settling of oneself for the other's
   presence. There is full ease in going out and coming in. Expressions of
   love are not deemed intrusive here; nay, they are sanctioned as being
   due and comely. The heart knows its right to indulge itself over its
   object, and that, too, without check or shame. This is the glory of
   this affection. The love of pity, of gratitude, or of complacency must
   act decorously, and in proper form. But the love of kindred, the love
   of those who dwell in one house, and whom nature or the hand of God has
   bound together, feels its right to gratify itself, and is not fearful
   of being rebuked. This is its distinguishing boast. Nothing admits this
   but itself. This is in a full and deep sense, personal affection. . . .
   And it is the richest feast of the heart. . . .

   "It is a love which commands the whole being of the one in whom it
   seats itself. As to service, it makes it welcome. To say that service
   for the object of this affection is perfect freedom, is far too cold.
   It makes service infinitely grateful, even though it call for
   self-denial and weariness. And it can render its offering without
   caring for any eye or heart to approve it, but that of the one whom it
   has made its object. It cares not that others should be able to esteem
   its ways. It has all the desired fruit of its service, if its object
   approve it, and give but His presence at the end of it. As to society,
   this affection wants none but that of its object. If there be no
   weariness felt in service, as we have been saying, so is there no
   irksomeness known in solitude. All that is cared for is the presence of
   that One who commands the heart. There is no sense of solitude, if that
   One alone be present; there is no sense of satiety, though that One be
   alway present. As to authority in the soul, it holds its place, I need
   not say, unrivalled. It is the man of the heart. It breaks the bands,
   and cuts the cords of other desires. It makes us to undervalue all
   things but the one. . . . Other things are esteemed only according to
   their connection with this. And it will control the wrong, and
   cultivate the right tendencies of the heart. For occasions which might
   wound vanity or gratify pride are not valued nor pursued, while we
   retain it; and yet to approve ourselves there, we will nerve the heart
   and hand to great and generous ways

   "What intenseness is here, and what purity also. It refreshes the soul
   to think that we have been created susceptible of such an affection,
   and to know that Christ is the offered Object of it. He proposes
   Himself to it. He claims the supreme place in our hearts. 'He that
   loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me.' Whatever
   passion of the soul be moved, it is God's right to have the highest
   exercise of it towards Himself. . . . This may sound a solemn truth,
   but it is a happy one. Is it not blessed to know, that our Lord claims
   our hearts and their affections? Have any of us read the 'first and
   great commandment' without at least sometimes rejoicing in the grace
   that would make such a demand upon us? Is it nothing to us that God
   Himself values our love, that He says to us, 'My son, give me thy
   heart'? . . . And we want these affections to make us happy, and to set
   us free. It is the divine method of delivering us from the tyranny of
   carnal or worldly desires. It is the Spirit's way of spoiling other
   attractions of their power to seduce and fill the heart, and of lifting
   the soul above the frettings of low anxieties. "Would that this love
   were more shed abroad in our hearts, beloved! How should we learn,
   then, to entertain Christ as this affection entertains or embalms its
   object. And what a Heaven it will be, when He is ours in this way,
   feeding this fire in our souls, and giving us to know in Himself and
   His beauties, this seraph love, without chill, for ever and ever!"

   Such is the Song of songs. It is the soul's longing after, and
   satisfaction in her Beloved. "Tell Him that I am sick of love" is its
   cry. "Tell me, oh thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
   thou makest thy flock to rest at noon."

   The question of the ground of our acceptance with God, is not touched
   upon in this book. The whole expression is that of a soul that knows
   its place of union, but longs for a fuller manifestation of it; and the
   faults mourned, are all only such faults as are based upon the closest
   intimacy. No open transgression or conscious disobedience are lamented,
   or even apparently thought possible, only a little hesitation in
   responding to His call, a momentary coldness, a temporary slothfulness
   of soul; faults, the very nature of which reveal the fine spiritual
   sense of the heart that can mourn them.

   There is a manifest development of the "apprehending of that for which
   we are apprehended of Christ Jesus" in the experience of this bride. In
   the first chapter she longs after the Beloved. In the second chapter He
   is found, and her heart is made conscious of His manifested love, and
   exclaims rapturously, "My beloved is mine, and I am His." In the third
   chapter something, a little slothfulness of spirit, perhaps, has caused
   a temporary loneliness and darkness, and the soul has again to seek her
   Beloved, and again she finds Him and rests in His love. "By night on my
   bed I sought Him whom my soul loveth: I sought Him, but I found Him
   not. I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the
   broad ways I will seek Him whom my soul loveth:  I sought Him, but I
   found Him not. The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I
   said, Saw ye Him whom my soul loveth? It was but a little that I passed
   from them, but I found Him whom my soul loveth" I held Him, and would
   not let Him go, until I had brought Him into my mother's house, and
   into the chamber of her that conceived me. I charge you, O ye daughters
   of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir
   not up, nor awake my love, till He please."

   In chapter iv. He declares what she is to Him, that her heart may be
   reassured, after its temporary slothfulness. "Thou art all fair, my
   love, there is no spot in thee." "Thou hast ravished my heart, my
   sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
   with one chain of thy neck. How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse!
   how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments
   than all spices!" It is hard for the natural man to accept such love as
   this, as really existing in the heart of the Lord towards His people.
   We can comprehend how it is that we should love Him, but that He should
   love us, literally and actually love us, with the intensity and delight
   here expressed, seems an impossibility. And yet it is all, and far
   more, contained in our Lord's own words, "As the Father hath loved me,
   so have I loved you." Thou, O Father, hast loved them as Thou hast
   loved me." What an "as" and "so" are here! And how little of this road
   have our souls as yet travelled, beloved, that we find it so hard to
   comprehend this lovely mystic song!

   Chap. v. gives us another experience. Again a little hesitation to
   respond to the call of the Beloved for communion, deprives the bride of
   His presence, and in the desolation of her heart she goes out a second
   time to seek Him. "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my
   Beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove,
   my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the
   drops of the night. I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I
   have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? My Beloved put in His
   hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for Him. . . . .
   I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had withdrawn Himself and was
   gone: my soul failed when He spake; I sought Him but I could not find
   Him; I called Him but He gave me no answer. . . . I charge you, O ye
   daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my Beloved, that ye tell Him that I
   am sick of love." v. 1-8. The intensity of her desire, arouses the
   interest of those she questions, and they ask, "What is thy Beloved
   more than another be- loved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy
   Beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?" This
   calls out her ardent praises of her Beloved, and in praising Him, she
   is taught of God where to find Him, and advances a step onward in her
   apprehension of the relationship between them. "My Beloved is gone down
   into His garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens and to
   gather lilies. I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine. He feedeth
   among the lilies." vi. 2, 3. Before it was, "My Beloved is mine, and I
   am His." The chief thought then was her possession of Him. But now it
   is, "I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine." Her soul has taken
   hold of the deeper truth here, her Beloved's ownership of her. It is
   blessed to have Christ for ours, but infinitely more blessed for us to
   be His. If He is ours only, we may fail to keep Him, but if we are His,
   He can never cease to keep us. The Shepherd does in a sense belong to
   the sheep, but the secret of their safety lies in this, that they
   belong to Him. This, however, is an advanced apprehension of our
   relationship to Christ. Our first realization is always of our
   ownership of Him, and it needs some such exercises of soul as this
   Bride had gone through, to teach us the deeper truth.

   In chaps. vi. and vii., the Beloved whom she has thus regained, tells
   out her preciousness afresh in stronger words than ever. He calls her
   "My dove, my undefiled," and says, "How fair and how pleasant art thou,
   O love, for delights." vii, 6. And He expresses the intensity of His
   love in wondrous words that can be received only by that heart which
   has come indeed to the utter end of self, "Turn away thine eyes from
   me, for they have overcome me!" Can it be indeed possible that our love
   is this to our Lord? The bride here believes the words of her Beloved,
   and exclaims in answer, for the third time, but with a far deeper
   expression than before of the amazing yet blessed truth, "I am my
   Beloved's, and His desire is toward me." vii. 10. Her possession of the
   Beloved is left out altogether now; it is enough for her that she
   belongs to Him. And her soul has reached the consciousness at last that
   she is precious to Him also, "His desire is toward me." She has always
   known that she desired Him, but that He should desire her is something
   deeper and harder to learn. And yet it is most blessedly true; as other
   parts of the Scriptures abundantly testify. "Hearken, O daughter, and
   consider, incline thine ear, forget also thine own people and thy
   father's house, so shall thy king greatly desire thy beauty." Ps. xlv.
   11. "Now, therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
   covenant, then shall ye be a peculiar treasure unto me." Ez. xix. 5.
   "For the Lord taketh pleasure in His people." Ps. cxlix. 4. "Neither
   shall thy land any more be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called
   Hephzibah" (i. e., my delight is in her) "and thy land Beulah" (i. e.,
   married): "for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be
   married." Is. lxii. 4.

   This is the third time that the close union and mutual affection of the
   Bridegroom and the Bride are thus mentioned in this Song. First it was,
   "My Beloved is mine, and I am His." ii. 16. Next it was, "I am my
   Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine." vi. 3. And here it is, "I am my
   Beloved's, and His desire is toward me." vii. 10. St. Ambrose says
   concerning these three sayings, that they give us a threefold diversity
   in the manner of the Bride's expression, which denote the three stages
   of her progress in the love of God; to wit, her beginning, advance, and
   perfection. First she thinks most of possessing Christ; next she
   realizes chiefly that He possesses her; and at last she rejoices in the
   unspeakable knowledge that His desires are toward her, and that she is
   necessary to His joy. This latest apprehension is the fulfilment of
   Paul's prayer for the Ephesian christians in Eph. i. 17, 18, "That the
   God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you
   the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him: the eyes
   of your understanding being enlightened: that ye may know what is the
   hope of His calling, and what the riches of the glory of His
   inheritance in the saints." Christians may learn at an early stage in
   their experience something of the riches of their inheritance in
   Christ; but it is a far deeper lesson, and one often learned far later,
   to know the riches of His inheritance in us. The bride here had learned
   it at last, and the immediate result is, that she who in the beginning
   had been invited by the Bridegroom to come with Him, now invites Him to
   come with her. "Come my Beloved, let us go forth into the field: let us
   lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see
   if the vine flourish; whether the tender grape appear, and the
   pomegranates bud forth: there will I give Thee my loves. The mandrakes
   give a smell, and at our gated are all manner of pleasant fruits, new
   and old, which I have laid up for Thee, O my Beloved." vii.11-13. She
   has realized so fully the "riches of His inheritance in the saints,"
   that she can confidently call upon Him to come with her and enjoy the
   pleasant fruits she has hid up for Him. This is indeed to know the love
   of Christ which passeth knowledge. May our Lord Himself reveal it to
   us!

   Chap. viii. appears to be a sort of recapitulation of the whole
   wondrous story. The longing and the satisfying of that longing,
   accompanied by a glorious assertion of the might and purity of true
   love, are here again set forth, 1-7. The "little sister," type of the
   soul who has but just begun to believe on Christ, and to be fed with
   milk, is here encouraged to look for and expect an increase, 8, 9. And,
   finally, in the last verse, the Bride reiterates her invitation to her
   Beloved. "Make haste, my Beloved, and be thou like to a roe, or to a
   young hart upon the mountain of spices." Reminding us of the closing
   verses of Revelation also, "He which testifieth these things saith,
   Surely I come quickly; Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."

   With this book the developing series concerning the heart exercises of
   God's people as to sanctification, closes, for the soul has made its
   final discovery, and has learned at last the all-sufficiency of the
   love of Christ to swallow up and extinguish everything else! And fears,
   perplexities, disappointments, mysteries, questionings -- all are lost
   in the ocean of Divine love! It has entered here into that realized
   union with the Lord, which is the consummation of Christian experience,
   and which includes within itself all possible gift and blessing. Earth
   can contain no more than this union. And Heaven itself will only be the
   perfection and completion of it, when the Bride shall sit down forever
   beside her Bridegroom, upon His throne, and share His eternal glory.

   Beloved, have our hearts entered into this "banqueting house" where joy
   unspeakable and full of glory awaits us? Have we consciously realized
   this wondrous union, and are our souls rejoicing in its unspeakable
   delights? Has this blessed "mystery" of our faith been revealed to us,
   and are our hearts opened wide to receive it? Are we walking, with the
   step of a possessor, through this marvellous palace of delights, and
   claiming each fresh revelation of its unutterable secrets as our own?
   It is a palace open to all, though all do not enter it; it is a union
   intended for every one, though but few apprehend it; it is a mystery
   revealed to the babes, but hid from the wise and prudent. For our
   Divine Bridegroom Himself prayed while on earth "That they all may be
   one; as Thou Father, art in me, and I in Thee, that they also may be
   one in us: . . . . I in them, and Thou in me, that they may be made
   perfect in one; that the world may know that Thou hast sent me, and
   hast loved them as Thou hast loved me." "That they all may be one!" And
   let us praise the Lord for this little word "all"! And let us act on it
   with the simple faith of the bride about whom we have been reading, and
   yield ourselves to its sweet fulfillment. For to such as do, there will
   begin for them straightway, days of heaven upon earth. And then, in the
   blaze of this overmastering and utterly satisfying love, the wonderful
   prayer in Eph. iii. 14-19 will be fulfilled, and they will be really
   able at last to "comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and
   length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of Christ which
   passeth knowledge," and will be filled to the very brim "with all the
   fulness of God."


   "O Jesus, Jesus! dearest Lord! forgive me if I say

   For very love, Thy sacred name a thousand times a day.

   I love Thee so, I know not how my transports to control;

   Thy love is like a burning fire within my very soul.


   "Oh wonderful! that Thou shouldst let so vile a heart as mine

   Love Thee with such a love as this, and make so free with Thine,

   The craft of this wise world of ours poor wisdom seems to me;

   Ah! dearest Jesus! I have grown childish with love of Thee.


   "For thou to me art all in all, my honour and my wealth,

   My soul's desire, my body's strength, my soul's eternal health.

   Burn, burn, O Love! within my heart, burn fiercely night and day,

   Till all the dross of earthly loves is burned, and burned away.


   O Light in darkness, Joy in grief, O Heaven begun on earth!

   Jesus! my Love! my Treasure! who can tell what Thou art worth?

   O Jesus! Jesus! sweetest Lord! what art Thou not to me?

   Each hour brings joys before unknown, each day new liberty!


   "What limit is there to Thee, Love? Thy flight where wilt thou stay?

   On! on! our Lord is sweeter far to-day than yesterday.

   O love of Jesus! Blessed love! so will it ever be;

   Time cannot hold thy wondrous growth; no, nor eternity!

CHAPTER XXIII.

THE PROPHETS.

  THE LORD'S REVELATION OF HIS PLANS TO HIS CHILDREN.

  Keynote: John xv. 15.

   PROPHECY is God's revelation of His secret plans and purposes. It was
   given not for a merely temporary use, but for all ages and all people.
   Paul says concerning it, Whatsoever things were written aforetime were
   written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
   Scriptures might have hope. Rom. xv.4. Prophecy it is manifest can
   only come from the Lord, for He alone knows the end of things from the
   beginning, and He only holds the threads of destiny in His hands.
   Therefore we are told concerning the prophets, that, The prophecy came
   not in old time by the will of man:  but holy men of God spake as they
   were moved by the Holy Ghost. 2 Peter i. 21. Throughout the books of
   the prophets, consequently, we read continually, And the Lord spake,
   or, Thus saith the Lord," or, "The Lord spake, saying; "so that of
   each one it is manifestly true that "the Spirit of the Lord spake by
   him," and "His word was in his tongue."

   In giving to His people these books of prophecy, the Lord is treating
   them as friends, for He Himself when on earth said to His disciples
   "Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what
   His Lord doeth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I
   have heard of my Father I have made known unto you." Abraham was called
   the "friend of God," and when God was about to destroy Sodom, although
   it was not a matter that concerned Abraham personally, He said "Shall I
   hide from Abraham that thing which I do ?" And He stopped on His way to
   Sodom to tell His purposes to His "friend," listening with all the
   condescension of a real friendship to Abraham's plea for the doomed
   city, and even yielding everything that he asked. No sweeter picture of
   the reality of our position as "friends of God" could be given than
   this story of Abraham. And I feel that when we come to the study of
   these prophetical books, we should realize ourselves as being in this
   blessed position of personal intimacy, and should understand that our
   Father and our Friend is here disclosing to us His secrets. "Surely the
   Lord will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the
   prophets." Amos iii. 7.

   Written prophecy began about the year 800 B. C., during the reigns of
   the divided kingdom when all was outward confusion and the faith of the
   Lord's true people needed a divine revelation to pierce the gloom that
   surrounded them on every hand. With the plainest declarations of His
   judgments on the sin that so abounded in the midst of His people, the
   Lord, from the first, joined the most distinct assurances of the coming
   of a Saviour, who should usher in a kingdom of righteousness and peace,
   that would finally "cover the earth as the waters cover the sea."

   The Lord Jesus Christ therefore, and His salvation form the centre of
   all prophecy, as we read in 1 Pet. i. 10-13, "Of which salvation the
   prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the
   grace that should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time
   the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified
   beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.
   Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they
   did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that
   have preached the gospel unto you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from
   heaven; which things the angels desire to look into." Again we read in
   Acts iii. 24, "Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that
   follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
   days." Also in Acts xxvi. 22, 23, Paul declared that his preaching was
   but a "witnessing to both small and great," of the very things which
   the prophets and Moses had said should come; "that Christ should
   suffer, and that He should be the first that should rise from the dead,
   and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."

   A recent writer has said concerning these books that, "Parallel with
   the record of prophecy, runs a historical record of its fulfilment, up
   to the point when light of the gospel of Christ is shed over the world.
   There was a time when all that was known of God's gracious purposes was
   matter of prediction only; but now an important part of it has become
   matter of history; and the transference of events from the one record
   to the other is continually advancing. It is easy to see the advantage
   of having these records side by side. The fulfilment of any part of
   prophecy, besides being important in itself, gives the most confident
   assurance of the completion of the fulfilment. Thus if we have at first
   a prediction of glory as the result of suffering, the accomplishment of
   the predicted suffering is the surest pledge of the coming glory. . . .
   The great burden of prophecy is the coming of a Divine Saviour to
   suffer and conquer for man, and then to share the fruits of His
   conquest with His people. Now the first part we know is accomplished,
   and this stands to us the pledge of all the rest."

   We are encouraged therefore by the literal fulfilment of all the
   details of the prophecies concerning the first coming of our Lord in
   humiliation, to look towards an equally literal fulfilment of the
   prophecies concerning His second coming in glory, and we shall find a
   careful study of that which is here written in reference to it, of deep
   interest and great practical value.

   There are seventeen books of prophecy. Hosea, Amos, Joel, Micah, Nahum,
   Zephaniah, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Habakkuk wrote previous to the carrying
   away of the Jews into Babylon; Ezekiel, Daniel and Obadiah wrote during
   the course of the captivity; and Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, after
   the restoration of the Jew's under Ezra and Nehemiah to their own land.
   The prophecy of Isaiah is the first in the arrangement of the books in
   our Bibles, but in point of time Joel, Amos and Hosea are supposed to
   have written their books earlier. A comparison of the dates at the
   beginning of each book will make this clear to us. But the opening
   verses in Isaiah, Amos, and Hosea all point to about the same period of
   time, with only the difference of a few years. "The vision of Isaiah
   the son of Amoz which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the
   days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah," Is. i. 1.
   Compare Hosea i. 1 and Amos i. 1. The prophecy of Jonah which is dated
   862 B. C., and which had reference to Nineveh only, though containing a
   hidden type of Christ's death and resurrection, is not taken into
   account here.

   I have no doubt the order of these books as it is given to us in our
   Bibles, has some spiritual revelation in it, which we have not yet
   perhaps fathomed; and so also, I believe, have the meanings of the
   names of the different prophets. These meanings can be found in chapter
   ii.

   The prophecies deal mostly with the dispersion of the ten tribes, the
   captivity and restoration of Judah, and the utter apostasy of the
   people from the worship of the true God, together with the Lord's final
   purposes of grace and mercy. They are full of appalling descriptions of
   the doom of an apostate nation, but these are always coupled with
   exulting descriptions of the mighty Redeemer who was to come, and of
   the glory of His reign. Thus Amos says concerning Israel, "I will sift
   the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a
   sieve;" but adds a little after, "In that day will I raise up the
   tabernacle of David that is fallen; . . and I will bring again the
   captivity of Israel, . . . and I will plant them in their own land, and
   they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given
   them, saith the Lord thy God;" Amos ix. 11-15; a prediction which in
   Acts xv. 16, 17 is declared to refer to Christ. Joel also, who predicts
   the awful destruction from the Almighty to come upon the rebellious
   nation, also declares that "then will the Lord be jealous for His land,
   and pity his people. Yea, the Lord will answer and say unto His people,
   Behold I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be
   satisfied therewith, and I will no more make you a reproach among the
   heathen. . . . And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out
   My Spirit upon all flesh. . . . And it shall come to pass, that
   whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered: for in
   mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath
   said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call." All of which is
   shown us in Acts ii. 16-21 to have had an incipient fulfilment on the
   day of Pentecost; and which also plainly points onward to a future
   complete and glorious fulfilment, when Christ shall come in power to
   establish His outward millenial Kingdom. With equal plainness do all
   the prophets, whether those before the captivity, or those who shared
   it, as well as those who were restored from it, speak of this coming
   glory.

   These prophecies take no note apparently of the centuries of time which
   were to elapse between the incipient fulfilment of the promises in
   Christ's first coming, and their complete fulfilment at His second
   coming. The long period of the Church's history called in Luke 21: 24
   the "times of the Gentiles" were apparently utterly ignored, and our
   Lord's coming in humiliation to die, and His coming in glory to reign,
   are connected often in the same sentence, as though they were to be
   coincident in time. It is essential to the right understanding of
   prophecy to be aware of this. The reason given for it by students of
   Scripture has been, that, with the death of Christ, and the "cutting
   off of the Jews," Jewish history ceased; and that the "times of the
   Gentiles" which are going on now, until the return of Christ, and the
   restoration of the Jews, during which "Jerusalem is to be trodden under
   foot of the Gentiles," is not noticed by anything more than sometimes a
   slight allusion; the prophecy for the most part passing right over it,
   and taking up the thread of Jewish history at its close, as though no
   time had elapsed between. Paul speaks very fully concerning these
   "times of the Gentiles" in Rom. xi. 11-27, closing with the words, "For
   I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest
   ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is
   happened to Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. And so
   all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of
   Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: for
   this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins."

   The passage quoted by our Lord in Luke iv. 16-19 is a striking
   illustration of this close connection in the prophecies, of things,
   which in actual experience were to be many centuries apart. He read
   from the prophet Esaias in chap. 61: 1, 2, stopping short however in
   the middle of verse 2. The verse reads in Isaiah, "To proclaim the
   acceptable year of our Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to
   comfort all that mourn." But our Lord stopped at the end of the first
   sentence, "To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord," although only
   a comma separates it from that which follows, "the day of vengeance of
   our God." The reason of this was, that the acceptable year had come,
   but the day of vengeance had not come, and has not come yet. Nearly
   1900 years at least have therefore in fact separated these two things,
   which in prophecy seemed to be coincident. Following out this prophecy,
   on from the point where our Lord closed the book and sat down, to its
   end, we find the final restoration of the Jews plainly declared, their
   authority over the Gentiles re-established and Jerusalem again made a
   "praise in the earth. See Isaiah lxi. 4-11; also lxii. which is plainly
   a continuation of the same prophetic message.

   Many devout readers of the Bible have objected to the thought of a
   literal fulfilment of prophecy, and have been inclined to think that it
   refers only to the Church in a spiritual sense. But I believe most
   careful students of the present day take a different view, and agree in
   thinking that these prophecies refer primarily to Israel and Judah,
   although they have also a very blessed typical application to
   Christians. We who now by faith enter into the inward spiritual kingdom
   of our Lord, enter also into spiritual blessings, which have a
   wonderful correspondence to the temporal ones here set forth. There is
   doubtless to be a real outward millennium on this earth, when the
   "kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of
   His Christ;" but there is also now and here, for every faithful heart,
   an inward millennial experience, which answers spiritually, to the
   descriptions these prophecies give of the future earthly glory. It is
   doubtless from this cause that the mistake has arisen in the Church, of
   monopolizing to herself prophecies, which belong primarily to Israel,
   and which are plainly to have a literal as well as a spiritual
   fulfilment.

   It is curious however that, in this appropriation, Christians have
   taken only the blessings to themselves, and have handed the curses over
   to the Jews, and this fact should have long ago opened every eye to the
   mistake. For in many places the blessings and the curses are together
   in one sentence, and cannot be understood by any really intelligent
   mind other than as referring to one and the sane class of people. It is
   plainly the people who have been cursed, who are to have the blessings.
   And while, as I say, we may use these glorious prophecies as the
   typical expression of our present inward millennial joys, we must never
   lose sight of the fact that they are to be literally and actually
   fulfilled to the Jews, in their triumphant return to their own land,
   and their restoration there to acceptance with the Lord, and to true
   righteousness before Him.

   In tracing the course of prophecy I have not space to dwell long upon
   those prophecies which refer to Christ's first coming, and their
   literal fulfilment, especially as they are already familiar to every
   student, and the references in the margins of any good reference Bible
   bring them all out with great clearness. I will therefore simply insert
   at the close of this chapter, out or the Bagster Bible, a collection of
   all the prophecies referring to Christ, with their parallel passages in
   the New Testament.

   In reference to the prophecies referring to Christ's second coming in
   glory, and the restoration of the Jews, I can only give a general view.
   The field of unfulfilled prophecy is too vast to be taken up in detail
   within the limits of a book like this. Moreover, the views of careful
   and earnest students, concerning its details, differ so widely, that I
   should feel very cautious about entering into it too minutely or
   stating anything too positively.

   That the Lord Jesus Christ will surely come again to reign in a kingdom
   of universal righteousness on this world is, I think, accepted by most
   Christians in the present day. But as to the details of this event
   there are, as I have said, a variety of views. The two principal are
   called respectively the Pre-millennial and the Post-millennial Advent.
   The one states that Christ is to return before the millennium, and is
   to usher in that blessed time by His redeeming and purifying presence.
   The other states that He is to come at the close of the millennium, and
   that the world is to be prepared for His presence by the previous
   universal reign of righteousness and peace. My own view is the former,
   as it seems to me most in accordance with. Scripture teaching.

   The story as I receive it, is simply this:--

   I. The Lord will come back suddenly, like a thief in the night, to
   receive His saints to Himself. Those who are dead will be raised, and
   the having saints will be caught up with them, to "meet the Lord in the
   air," as we read,

   "For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also
   which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say unto you
   by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the
   coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the
   Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
   the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall
   rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
   shall we ever be with the Lord." 1 Thess. iv. 14-17.

   "Behold, I shew you a mystery: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all
   be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump:
   for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
   and we shall be changed." 1 Cor. xv. 51, 52. See also 2 Thess. ii. 1;
   Luke xvii. 26-37 with Isa. xxvi. 20; Luke xxi. 36; Matt. xxv. 1-13.

   The Lord will not be visible to the world at large at this time, for
   the saints must first be gathered up to meet Him thus, "in the air;"
   and the only thing the world will know about it, will be the sudden and
   unaccountable disappearance of all the Christians out of it.

   "I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed: the one
   shall be taken, and the other shall be left. Two women shall be
   grinding together; the one shall be taken and the other left. Two men
   shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
   Luke xvii. 34, 35, 36.

   II. While still "in the air," the saints will be judged in reference,
   not to their salvation but as to their rewards. See 1 Cor. iii. 12-15.
   The marriage of the Lamb will take place, and the Son will present His
   bride before the throne with exceeding joy. As we read,

   "Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to Him: for the marriage
   of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready; And to her
   was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white:
   for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints." Rev. xix. 7-9
   with Matt. xxv. 1-13. See also Jude 24; 2 Cor. iv. 14; I Cor. iv. 3-6;

   III. Certain events will meanwhile be taking place upon the earth.
   Antichrist will arise and restore many of the Jews to their own land,
   making a covenant with them for seven years, which he will break at the
   end of three and a half years, and will assemble all nations around
   Jerusalem to besiege it. This siege will at first be successful, and
   the Jewish nation, in their distress, will at last be brought to know
   the depth of their need, and to call upon their God for help. As we
   read,

   "For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall
   shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they
   shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before." Matt.
   xxiv. 24, 25.

   "And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week" [seven
   years]; "and in the midst of the week" [at the end of three and one
   half years] "he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease, and
   for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even
   until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the
   desolate." Dan. ix. 27.

   "And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and
   the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand
   two hundred and ninety days" [about three and a half years]. Dan. xii.
   11.

   "When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by
   Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place (whoso readeth let him
   understand), then let them which be in Judæa flee into the mountains."
   Matt. xxiv. 15-29 with Rev. xiii. 1-8.

   "For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the
   city shall be taken and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and
   half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the
   people shall not be cut off from the city." Zech. xiv. 1, 2, 9. See
   also Joel ii. 1-32; Dan. ix. 26, 27; Rev. xiii. 1-8; Dan. xii. 1; Dan.
   vii. 21-26; Jer. xxx. 4-11; Rev. xi. 2; Dan. viii. 11-27; Rev. xvi. 14;
   Is. xiii. 4.

   IV. And now is the time to which all prophecy points, when Christ shall
   come again to the earth, bringing all His saints with Him, and His feet
   shall stand upon the Mount of Olives, that very mount from which He
   went up into heaven. As we read,

   "And when He had spoken these things, while they beheld, He was taken
   up; and a cloud received Him out of their sight. And while they looked
   steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men stood by them
   in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
   gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into
   heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into
   heaven. Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,
   which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey." Acts i. 9-12.

   "Then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those nations, as when
   He fought in the day of battle. And His feet shall stand on the Mount
   of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east." "And the Lord shall
   be King over all the earth: in that day shall there be one Lord and His
   name One. All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon,
   south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her
   place from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the
   corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's
   wine-presses. And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more
   utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited." Zech. xiv.
   3, 4, 9-11. "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of
   these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints,
   to execute judgment upon all." Jude 14, 15. "When Christ who is our
   life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory." Col.
   iii. 4. See also on this point, Dan. vii. 21, 22; Joel ii. 1-11, with
   Rev. xix. 11-21; Is. xiii. 3-6, xxxi. 4-5; Ps. cii. 16, xcvi. 10-13;
   Mal. iii. 1-5; Ezek. xliii. 1-4; Haggai ii. 21, 22; Is. lxvi. 15; lii.
   10; 1 Thess. iii. 13; Is. xxxi. 4, 5.

   V. Every eye will now see Him and all the tribes of the earth will
   mourn at the sight, and will call on the rocks and the hills to cover
   them, and hide them from the day of His coming. He will deliver
   Jerusalem, and destroy His enemies, and will gather together His chosen
   people, the Jews, from all the lands where they have been scattered,
   and restore them to their own land, where they will recognize Him and
   mourn for their rejection of Him. As we read,

   "And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then
   shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of
   man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power, and great glory. And He
   shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet; and they shall
   gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven
   to the other." Matt. xxiv. 30, 31 with Is. xi. 10, 11.

   "And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to destroy all
   the nations that come against Jerusalem. And I will pour upon the house
   of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and
   of supplications; and they shall look upon Me whom they have pierced,
   and they shall mourn for Him as one mourneth for his only son, and
   shall be in bitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his
   first-born." Zech. xii. 8-14.

   "And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set His
   hand again the second time to recover the remnant of His people, which
   shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from
   Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the
   islands of the sea. And He shall set up an ensign for the nations, and
   shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
   dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth." Is. xi. 11, 12.

   See also Rev. vi. 15-17; Luke xxiii. 27-30; Is. ii. 19-21; Zech. viii.;
   Zech. xiv. 12-15, Ez. xxxix. 11-22 with Rev. xix. 17-21; Zeph. iii. 8;
   Mal. iv. 2; Dan. xii. 1; Jer. xxx. 4-9, xxxi. 8-15, xxxii. 42- 44,

   lxii.; 1 Thess. ii. 1-9 with Is. xi. 1-9; Haggai ii. 7.

   VI. At this time the judgment of the nations who are living on the
   earth, spoken of in Matt. xxv. 30-46, will take place; sin will be
   purged out of the world by the judgments and rebukes of the Lord, and
   universal peace and righteousness will be established. As we read,

   "When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels
   with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory: and before
   Him shall be gathered all nations: and He shall separate them one from
   another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: And He shall
   set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left." Matt. xxv.
   31-33.

   "And in mercy shall the throne be established: and He shall sit upon it
   in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment, and
   hasting righteousness." Is. xvi. 5.

   "And He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people:
   and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
   pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither
   shall they learn war any more." Is. ii. 4.

   "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and He that sat
   upon Him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He doth
   judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head
   were many crowns; and He had a name written that no man knew but He
   Himself. And was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and His name
   is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed
   Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean. And out
   of His mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the
   nations: and He shall rule them with a rod of iron: and He treadeth the
   winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He hath on
   His vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of Kings, and Lord of
   Lords." Rev. xix. 11-16. See also Joel iii. 12-16; Ps. ix. 7, 8; Ps.
   lxxvi. 9; lxxxix. 14; Is. iv. 3, 4; xlii. 4; Matt. xii.18-21; John v.
   22; Is. xi. 1-9 with 2 Thess. ii. 1-9; Is. xxvi. 21; xiii. 6-11; xviii.
   21, 22; lxvi. 14-16; Zeph. i. 14-18; Zech. xiii. 8, 9; Is. x. 20-22
   with Rom. ix. 27, Micah v. 7-8, Zech. xiv. 16; Is. xix. 22-25.

   VII. The creation will now be delivered from the bondage of corruption,
   and restored to its original glory. Jerusalem will become again a holy
   city inhabited by the people of the Lord. Satan will be chained for a
   thousand years, and the millennium will be ushered in. As we read,

   For the earnest expectation of the creature [creation] waiteth for the
   manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature [creation] was made
   subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of Him who hath
   subjected the same in hope; because the creature [creation] itself
   shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
   liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation
   groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now." Rom. viii. 19-22
   with Is. xi. 6-9. "Then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no
   stranger pass through her any more." "But Judah shall dwell for ever,
   and Jerusalem from generation to generation." Joel iii. 16-20. "And I
   saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless
   pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that
   old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand
   years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, that he
   should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be
   fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season." Rev. xx.
   1-3; See also, Is. lx. lxi., lxii., xxxv., lxv. 17-25; Zech. xiv. ;
   Micah iv. 1-5; Hab. ii. 14; Is. li. 3, 11; xxxii. 15-18; xxxiii. 20-22;
   Hosea ii. 14-23; Joel ii. 21-27; Amos ix. 11-15; Rom. xi. 26, 27.

   VIII. During the millennium the Lord Jesus Christ will reign over the
   earth, and His saints will share His throne. As we read,

   "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a
   righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
   judgment and justice in the earth. In His days Judah shall be saved,
   and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is His name whereby He shall be
   called, The Lord our Righteousness." Jer. xxiii. 5, 6.

   "And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto
   them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of
   Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast,
   neither the image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads,
   or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
   years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
   years were finished. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy
   is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second
   death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and Christ, and
   shall reign with Him a thousand years." Rev. xx. 4-6.

   "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
   government shall be upon His shoulders: and His name shall be called
   Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
   Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace there
   shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom, to
   order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
   henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform
   this." Is. ix. 6, 7.

   "I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
   with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
   brought Him near before Him. And there was given him a dominion, and
   glory,, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should
   serve Him: His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not
   pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed. . . . .
   But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the
   kingdom for ever even for ever and ever, . . . And the kingdom and
   dominion, and the greatness of the dominion under the whole heaven,
   shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose
   kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and
   obey Him." Dan. vii. 13, 14, 18, 27. See also Matt. xix. 28; 1 Cor. vi.
   2, 3; Rev. ii. 26, 27; Micah iv. 1, 2, 3; Zech. vi. 12, 13; Ps. lxxii.;
   Ps. xcvi. 10-13, with Rev. xix. 6. Ps. xcvii. 1-6; Ps. xcix. 1, 2; Is.
   xxiv. 23; xxxii. 1; Luke i. 32, 33; Rom. v. 17; xv. 12; 1 Cor. xv. 25;
   Rev. xi. 15.

   IX. At the end of the millennium, Satan will be loosed again for a
   little season, and will induce men again to rebel. A great army will be
   gathered against the Lord, and will be defeated. Satan will be cast
   into the lake of fire. The great white throne will be set up, and the
   dead will be judged. The new heavens and the new earth will be ushered
   in, and all sin and sorrow will forever flee away. As we read,

   "And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of
   his prison; and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the
   four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to
   battle: the number of whom is as the sands of the sea. And they went up
   on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints
   about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven,
   and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the
   lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are,
   and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. And I saw a
   great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth
   and the heavens fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I
   saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were
   opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the
   dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books,
   according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in
   it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and
   they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell
   were cast into the take of fire. This is the second death. And
   whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the
   lake of fire. And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first
   heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
   . . And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
   tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they
   shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them, and be their
   God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall
   be no more death neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any
   more pain: for the former things are passed away." Rev. xx. 7-15, and
   xxi. 3, 4.

   X. Finally, the Lord Jesus Christ, having accomplished the purposes of
   His mediatorial coming and reign, will deliver up the kingdom to His
   Father, and God will henceforth be "All in All."

   "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But
   every man in his own order; Christ tie first-fruits; afterward they
   that are Christ's at His coming. Then cometh the end, when He shall
   have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when He shall
   have put down all rule and all authority and power. For He must reign
   till He hath put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that shall
   be destroyed is death. For He hath put all things under His feet. But
   when He saith, All things are put under Him, it is manifest that He is
   excepted which did put all things under Him. And when all things shall
   be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto
   Him that put all things under Him, that God may be all in all." 1 Cor.
   xv. 22-28.

   Such are the outlines of the story of the latter days, as I have
   learned it. Of the times and seasons, I believe, it is not meant for us
   to know, as these God has put into His own power, Acts i. 6, 7. But
   that our Lord is coming again to this world of ours, and that His
   coming is to be at a day and an hour when we look not for Him, there
   can, I think, be no doubt. Therefore it behooves us to be ready, that
   we may not be ashamed before Him at His coming. And we would do well to
   take heed to the warning in 2 Pet. iii. 2-14:

   "Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last day scoffers,
   walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of His
   coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they
   were from the beginning of the creation. For this they willingly are
   ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the
   earth standing out of the water and in the water: whereby the world
   that then was, being overflowed with water perished: But the heavens
   and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store,
   reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
   men. But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is
   with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The
   Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness,
   but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish,
   but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will
   come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away
   with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the
   earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up. Seeing
   then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons
   ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness; looking for and
   hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens, being
   on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent
   heat? Nevertheless, we, according to His promise, look for new heavens
   and a new , wherein dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing
   that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him
   in peace, without spot, and blameless.

   I am well aware that this is a subject which does not interest all
   Christians, and which is considered fanciful and unprofitable by many.
   But if it is indeed a truth, as the angel declared to the disciples on
   the Mount of Olives, while they looked toward the heavens where a cloud
   had just received their Lord out of their sight, that "this same Jesus
   which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner as
   ye have seen Him go into Heaven," then it must certainly be important
   for us to know it, and to enter into the mind of God about it. And I
   believe myself that there is hardly any truth which has so great an
   effect in making Christians unworldly as this.

   For, if we expect one who is absent from us to return at any moment, we
   shall surely make ourselves ready for his coming, and will take care to
   arrange our matters so that when he comes he shall not find us engaged
   in anything of which we think he will not approve. And it has been very
   striking to me to notice that the Lord's exhortations to holiness of
   life are always based, not on the fear of death, but on the hope of His
   return, and its unexpectedness. As we read:

   "Watch, therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come."
   "Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not, the
   Son of Man cometh," Matt. xxiv. 42, 44. "Let your loins be girded
   about, and your lights burning: and ye yourselves like unto men that
   wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding: that when he
   cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately." "Be ye
   therefore ready also: for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when ye
   think not," Luke xii. 35, 36, 40. "Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye
   know not when the time is. For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far
   journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to
   every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch. Watch ye,
   therefore; for ye know not when the Master of the house cometh, at
   even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning; lest
   coming suddenly He find you sleeping, and what I say unto you, I say
   unto all, Watch." Mark xiii. 33-37.

   I am convinced that these passages teach us that the thought of the
   unexpectedness of our Lord's return is a far more powerful incentive to
   holiness than the thought of death; and I believe the Church has
   suffered great loss from having overlooked this. It all depends upon
   how much we love Him, whether we are longing to see Him back. And our
   present walk and life will surely be greatly modified by a firm belief
   on our part, that at any moment we may see Him and hear the voice of
   the trumpet that calls us to His side. Let us ask ourselves a few
   solemn questions here. Are we, like the early Christians, waiting for
   Him to come? Are we ready for His coming? We cannot wait until we are
   ready. What should we think of a housekeeper, who was expecting a visit
   from a very distinguished guest, and whose house should be all turned
   inside out with repairs and painting, and cleaning, with not a quiet
   room in it, but who should yet say to us, "Oh, yes, I am waiting
   longingly for my friend to arrive, and am expecting him at any moment?"
   I am sure we should stand amazed at such waiting as that, and would
   say, "But how can you wait for him until you are ready? Would not his
   coming now be, to say the least, very inconvenient and ill-timed; and
   would you not prefer that he should delay his coming, until you have
   prepared a comfortable place in which to receive him?"

   We may well pause and think, therefore, whether we are ready for our
   Lord's coming. Are our houses, and our lives, and our churches prepared
   to receive Him? Would His coming just at this present moment be
   inconvenient or ill-timed to us? If we knew of a certainty that He were
   coming next week should we go on with our lives as they are, and carry
   out our present plans and purposes for the few intervening days? I
   remember being very much impressed with hearing of John Wesley, that,
   upon being asked by a friend one morning how he would spend the day if
   he knew he should certainly die that night, he replied, after a solemn
   pause, "I should do just the things I have already planned to do. I
   should attend to the business I have laid out. I should see the friends
   I have expected to see. I should go to the places I have arranged for.
   I should read the books I have prepared. I should eat my meals, and
   take my usual rest, and should quietly await the hour of my death
   without one anxious thought." It seemed to me, when I heard it, grand
   to be ready like that! And such, I am sure, was our Lord's thought
   concerning us, when He said, "Therefore, be ye also ready, for in such
   an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."

   We may not perhaps understand all the details. But enough is plain to
   teach us that our Lord is surely coming again, and to stir our hearts
   with a triumphant hope of our own personal share in His glory. For if
   He should come to-morrow, what human tongue could put into words the
   unimagined and unspeakable joy and gladness that would become the
   portion of all His people! To see Him face to face, the Desire of all
   nations, and our own Beloved! To be made like Him! To be done with sin
   forever! To have our vile bodies fashioned like unto His glorious body!
   To be presented faultless before His Father's throne with exceeding
   joy! To sit down with Him in His kingdom! To be abundantly satisfied
   with the fatness of His house, and to drink forevermore of the river of
   His pleasures! Ah, who can tell or dream of what this would be?


   "He is coming! and the tidings

   Sweep through the willing air,

   With hope that ends forever

   Time's ages of despair.

   Old Earth from dreams and slumber

   Wakes up and says, Amen:

   Land and ocean bid Him welcome,

   Flood and forest join the strain.

   He is coming! and the mountains

   Of Judea ring again;

   Jerusalem awakens

   And shouts her glad Amen.

   He is coming! and the tidings

   Are rolling wide and far;

   As light flows out in gladness

   From yon fair morning star."

   The books of prophecy close with Malachi in the year 397 B. C. No
   prophet was to arise after him, and the Jewish nation were left from
   henceforth to wait, for nearly four hundred years, until "the
   consolation of Israel" should come. The closing words are a solemn and
   yet blessed warning and promise:

   "For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the
   proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day
   that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall
   leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear My name
   shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings; and ye
   shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread
   down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet
   in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts. Remember ye
   the law of Moses, My servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for
   all Israel, with the statues and judgments. Behold, I will send you
   Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of
   the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
   and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite
   the earth with a curse."

   Had Israel heeded this warning, and received Christ at His first coming
   as their King, who can say whether the world's salvation would not then
   have been accomplished? But they rejected Him, and the day of triumph
   has been deferred until the "times of the Gentiles" shall be fulfilled.

   But the Lord is not slack concerning His promise as some men count
   slackness, and the glorious" times of restitution of all things which
   God hath spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world
   began" shall surely come at last. And the day will dawn finally,
   according to the promise, when in "the dispensation of the fulness of
   times," God will "gather together in one all things in Christ, both
   which are in heaven, and which are on earth;: and when "at the name of
   Jesus every knee will bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth,
   and things under the earth; and every tongue will confess that Jesus
   Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

   "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly; Amen.
   Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
