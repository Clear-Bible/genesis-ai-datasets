PREFACE

   In January 1860 was issued at Buffalo, N. Y., the first number of The
   Earnest Christian by my beloved father. In the introductory article he
   states: "The doctrine of Christian Holiness as taught by Wesley and
   Fletcher, being as we conceive plainly enforced in the Word of God and
   constituting the real strength and power for good of the Church of
   Christ, will occupy a prominent place in our columns." Readers of The
   Earnest Christian will testify that this promise was amply redeemed.
   For more than a quarter of a century his pen was busy with topics vital
   to godliness. The subject of Holiness was a constantly recurring theme.

   This book is a compilation of the editorials written in the interval of
   the years 1860-1893. It necessarily must follow that there be some
   repetition of illustration and phraseology in articles written during
   such an extended period of time, without the logical connection that
   attaches to a formal treatise.

   Immediately following the death of my father, Feb., 27, 1893, there
   came a demand for the publication of a collection of his editorial
   writings. The work has been undertaken amidst the exacting demands of
   school work, it has been a labor of love, and of personal spiritual
   good. The reception accorded this venture, will decide as to the
   publication of other volumes on other topics.

   That this book may go forth to bless the world, with a fuller light and
   knowledge of God's good will to man, is my hope, my prayer. Amen.

CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

  A SUMMARY

   We propose to examine this all important subject in the light of the
   Bible.
   One plain text of the Scriptures proves more than a thousand human
   assertions.

   The words sanctification and holiness, as used in the Bible, mean the
   same thing. The same Greek word, hagiasmos, is translated in our Bible,
   sometimes by the word, holiness, and sometimes by the word,
   sanctification. The same is true of the word translated sometimes holy,
   and sometimes saint. The original is one and the same word.

   1. Holiness implies, in common with a state of justification, or
   pardon, victory over outward sin. A person that is holy does not commit
   sin. This is also true of one who lives justified before God. "For sin
   shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law, but
   under grace." That is, grace has the mastery over you. In the struggle
   between grace and sin, grace triumphs.


   "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin."--1 John 3:9

   But, "Sin is the transgression of the law." So that he who imagines
   that he enjoys the blessing of holiness, and yet does what God in his
   word forbids, or neglects to do what he commands, is deceived. His
   so-called faith is fatal presumption.

   2. Holiness is a state. It does not consist of a repetition of good
   acts, but is the gracious condition of the soul which prompts to the
   performance of all good actions. It is the pure fountain from which
   pure water continually flows.


   Proof: "Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy."--I Peter
   1:16.

   This does not say, Do holy things, but BE HOLY.


   "To the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness."--I
   Thess. 3:13

   It is the heart that is to be established; then the habits will be
   right, of course. These texts show that holiness is a state, and not
   merely good habits, much less simply a relation.

   3. Holiness implies deliverance from all wrong dispositions, tempers
   and desires; and from all inclination to indulge those that are right,
   in an unlawful manner, or to an inordinate degree. There are
   dispositions of the soul that are wrong in themselves, such as anger,
   pride, and covetousness. From all wrong tempers a holy person is so far
   delivered that be not only does not yield to them, but he does not feel
   them. Other desires become sinful only when indulged in an unlawful
   manner, or to an inordinate degree. Our Saviour hungered. In this he
   did not sin, but he would have sinned, if he had yielded to the
   temptations of Satan to satisfy His hunger in an unlawful manner. Enoch
   walked with God, and begat sons and daughters. In a holy person all his
   powers of body and mind are brought into harmony with the will of God.


   "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
   whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming
   of our Lord Jesus Christ."--I Thess. 5:23.

   This prayer teaches:

   1. That the body is so far sanctified as to be blameless. For it must
   be so, before it can be preserved in that state. Hence, when the victim
   of the use of tobacco, or of strong drink, is sanctified, his body
   undergoes such a change, through the power of the Spirit of God, that
   he no longer feels the terrible cravings for indulgences, which were
   fast hastening him on to destruction.

   2. The affections, passions, desires, and propensities are so subdued
   that they are the occasion of good, and not of harm.

   3. The intellect, the judgment, the will and the imagination, are made
   pure and holy in all their exercises.


   "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God."--II Cor. 7:1.

   Here we see that holiness is opposed to all filthiness, either of body
   or mind. It removes from soul and body everything that defiles.


   "Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after
   the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye
   through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall
   live."--Rom. 8:12, 13.

   He that does not live after the flesh, does not bring forth the works
   of the flesh.


   These are: "Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
   idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife,
   seditious, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and
   such like: . . . they which do such things shall not inherit the
   kingdom of God."--Gal. 5:19-21.

   They who are holy are led by the Spirit, and bring forth the fruit of
   the Spirit, which is:


   "Love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
   meekness, temperance."--Gal. 5:22, 23.

   4. Holiness is distinct from justification, and subsequent to it. When
   one is converted, he is so far made holy that he has victory over sin.
   But sin remains, though it does not reign.


   "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as
   unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."--I Cor. 3:1.

   These persons were "brethren," "babes in Christ." Therefore they were
   justified, they were not sinners, or backsliders, yet they were
   carnal--not yet made holy. A celebrated minister of the Gospel,
   suddenly attacked by disease, was recommended to drink brandy. He took
   a small quantity, and being unused to it, its effects were painfully
   visible. He was drunk, yet not a drunkard. So these believers were
   carnal--there were divisions among them, as is too often the case, over
   the respective merits of their favorite preachers--yet they were not
   carnally minded. In the main, their lives were in accordance with the
   precept of the Gospel.


   "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly."--I Thess. 5:23.

   This language implies that they were sanctified in part. Paul says that
   he remembered, without ceasing, their "work of faith and labor of love,
   and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ." He says they were
   worthy of imitation by believers in the regions around,


   "So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and
   Achaia."--I Thess. 1:7.

   Therefore they were not deluded, self-deceived, unconverted men and
   women who had crept into the church for the sake of popularity. Nor
   were they backslidden from God. Yet they needed to have God do a
   farther work for them--to sanctify them wholly.


   "Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go
   on unto perfection."--Heb. 6:1.

   These persons were living in the principles of the doctrine of Christ.
   They were justified believers. Paul exhorts them to go on to a
   perfection of holiness.

   Do not these plain passages abundantly sustain all we have said as to
   the nature of holiness?
     __________________________________________________________________

  II.--ITS NECESSITY

   1. It is indispensably necessary to qualify us for heaven.
   We cannot get there without it. None ever did, and none ever will.


   "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall
   see the Lord."--Heb. 12:14.

   "To see God," is to be in His presence, to enjoy the bliss He alone can
   impart. So that, unless he "Follows peace with all men and holiness,"
   no one, no matter what his church or his creed, can stand before the
   throne of God.


   "These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed
   their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."--Rev. 7:14.

   But "white robes" are the emblem of purity (Rev. 19:8).


   "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his
   holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
   lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully."--Ps. 24:3, 4.

   God's holy place is heaven. But only those who are pure in heart, and
   clean in life shall dwell there.

   2. Holiness is indispensable to present happiness. The unholy person
   cannot be happy. He may enjoy pleasure; but pleasure is not happiness.
   People seek after pleasure because the are unhappy. The pleasures of
   the world are short-lived and unsatisfactory. But he who is holy has a
   never-failing spring of enjoyment within.


   "In whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
   unspeakable, and full of glory."--I Peter 1:8.


   "The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
   righteous."--Ps. 118:15.

   3. Holiness is essential to usefulness. Unholy men may spread
   Christianity, but they pervert it as they spread. it. Their "riches are
   corrupted," and they corrupt Christianity when employed for its
   support. Perhaps no man ever devoted so much wealth for the spread of
   the Gospel as Constantine; and no one ever did so much to corrupt it.
   An impure channel will foul the purest water. Colored glass imparts its
   own hue to the light that passes through it. A holy soul alone is
   qualified to lead others into holiness.


   "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
   Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from
   me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy
   free Spirit. Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners
   shall be converted unto thee."--Ps. 51:10-13.

   One may, without a clean heart, or the joy of salvation, convert people
   to the church, but it is to be feared that few of them will be found to
   be converted to the Lord.


   "And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with
   other tongues. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized:
   and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand
   souls."--Acts 2:4, 41.

   Holiness is power. He that possesses it can do good.


   "For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."--I Cor. 4:20.
     __________________________________________________________________

  III.--ITS ATTAINABLENESS

   1. God commands it.


   "Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the Lord your
   God."--Lev. 20:7.


   "But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner
   of conversation."--I Pet. 1:15.

   God never commands that which is impossible. To affirm that he does is
   blasphemous. It would make him out a tyrant.

   2. To sanctify the soul or make it holy, is God's work. If this can be
   proved, then it follows that holiness is possible. With Him things are
   easy that are impossible for men.


   "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean: from
   all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will cleanse you. A new
   heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and
   I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh. And I will give you
   a heart of flesh, and I will put my Spirit within you, an cause you to
   walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments and do them." Ezek.
   36:25-27.

   Here God says He will do the work, and do it thoroughly.

   1. He will cleanse--not from some,--but from ALL idols, and from ALL
   filthiness.

   2. He will give a new heart and a new spirit.

   3. He will cause us to walk in His statutes and judgments. He will
   impart the spirit of obedience, and with it the power to obey.


   "Sanctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth."--John 17:17.


   "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly."--I Thess. 5:23.

   These passages plainly imply that it is God's work to make believers
   holy.

   3. Some have attained to holiness.


   "Enoch walked with God three hundred and sixty-five years."--Gen. 5:21,
   22. "Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah
   walked with God."--Gen. 6:9. "Job was perfect and upright, and one that
   feared God, and eschewed evil."--Job 1:1.

   In the New Testament, the disciples of Jesus are called Christians but
   three times, never Methodists, Baptists, or Presbyterians. Over sixty
   times they are called Saints, or the holy ones.
     __________________________________________________________________

  IV.--HOW IT MAY BE ATTAINED

   If it is by the power of God that we are sanctified, then why are not
   all, and especially all professing Christians, holy? Because they do
   not meet the conditions. These are:

   1. Giving one's self fully to God. All of time, talent, property,
   reputation influence, yea life itself, must be handed over to God to be
   His for ever.


   "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
   present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
   which is your reasonable service."--Rom. 12:1.

   The body includes all. A living sacrifice is a constant, perpetual one.


   "For I am the Lord your God; ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves,
   and ye shall be holy: for I am holy."--Lev. 11:44.

   That is, set yourselves apart for God's service, and he will make you
   holy.


   "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever will
   lose his life for my sake shall save it."--Matt. 16:25.

   2. Confession of all sin actual or inbred.


   "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."--I John 1:9.

   If we confess our actual sins he is faithful and just to forgive us. If
   we confess our inbred sins he is faithful and just to cleanse us from
   all unrighteousness.

   3. Faith in Christ as our sanctifier.


   "God put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by
   faith."--Acts 15:9.

   "That they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them
   which are sanctified by faith that is in me."--Acts 26:18.

   But beware that your so-called faith is not presumption. Otherwise you
   may become a self-conceited Pharisee, instead of a humble, meek, holy
   follower of Jesus.


   "How can ye believe which receive honor one of another, and seek not
   the honor that cometh from God only."--John 5:44.

   In both these passages faith is spoken of as the medium through which
   sanctification is received.

   Reader, what do you think of these passages of Scripture that we have
   brought before you? Do they not show you the necessity and the
   attainability of holiness? Do you live in this state of grace? If so,
   thank God, and press forward. If not, make no delay to obtain it. You
   have too much at stake to live without it a single day. Resolve that
   you will be holy. Ask God to search you. If, in the light of the
   Spirit, you see, as is often the case, that you are not justified, have
   the courage and honesty to confess your condition. If in a backslidden
   state you seek for holiness, you will, in all probability, take up with
   something short of reality.

   Be thorough! Confess as fully as the word and the Spirit of God direct.
   Give yourself up without the least reserve to obey the Lord in
   everything. Look to Jesus as your present Saviour from all sin. Plead
   His promises. Rely upon His grace to save you to the uttermost. Thus
   you shall soon feel the sanctifying power the Spirit of God all through
   soul and body. You will then, in your daily life, have your fruit unto
   holiness; and the witness of the Spirit will be given, to assure you of
   your present gracious state, and to give you a pledge of untold glories
   to be enjoyed in the world to come.


   "Now we have received, not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit
   which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to
   us of God."--I Cor. 2:12.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 2

  HOLINESS NOT UNDERSTOOD

   The Bible has much to say about holiness. It is an attribute of God.
   (Ps. 60:6; Rev. 4:8, et al). We are commanded to follow it. (Heb.
   12:14). To worship God in the beauty of holiness. (Ps. 29:2). Without
   it no man shall see the Lord. (Heb. 12:14). It is the one thing
   needful. There are many things which are convenient and useful; but
   this alone is indispensable to our welfare both in this world and in
   the world to come.

   It is important, then, that we have correct ideas of its nature. If we
   would hit a mark we must know where to aim. If we would attain an
   excellence we must know what it is. He who would search for diamonds,
   must know diamonds when he finds them.

   Upon first view, it may seem that men are pretty well agreed as to what
   constitutes holiness. But, on reflection this will be seen to be a
   mistake. Upon this point there is a wide diversity of opinion. Such is
   the imperfection of language and such the constitution of particular
   minds that the same words often fail to express the same idea to
   different persons, even when they are equally candid. But take holiness
   in its most tangible form--take it as exemplified in the lives of holy
   persons, and it is not generally acknowledged to be holiness. It is
   usually called by almost any other name than holiness. In God's sight,
   Job was a holy person. He says,


   "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in
   the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and
   escheweth evil?"--Job 1:8.

   But even his friends labored to convince him that he was a wicked man.
   Eliphaz says to him,


   "They that plough iniquity and sow wickedness, reap the same."--Job
   4:8.

   Bildad takes up the accusation and reminds him that


   "The hypocrite's hope shall perish."--Job 8:13.

   Zophar asks him,


   "Should thy lies make men hold their peace?"--Job 11:3.

   And even Elihu exclaims,


   "What man is like Job, who drinks up scorning like water? Which goeth
   in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked
   men."--Job 34:7-8.

   This was the opinion which his friends had of him, as expressed to his
   face. Of course the judgment of his enemies was much more unfavorable.

   Our Saviour exemplified holiness in its most perfect form. In His life,
   His conversation His spirit, and in all His actions He was holiness
   personified. He gave the most unmistakable proofs of disinterested love
   to all mankind. Yet the popular verdict concerning Him was,


   "Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and
   sinners."--Matt. 11:19.

   Christ told his disciples that they must not expect to be appreciated
   any better than He was.


   "If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more
   shall they call them of his household?"--Matt. 10:25.

   From that day down to the present, holiness in the disciples of Christ
   has been recognized by but few, even of those who call themselves
   Christians. John Wesley stated clearly, defended ably, and exemplified
   in his life the doctrine of holiness. Whitefield for burning zeal, and
   simple devotion to the cause of Christ, has not had a superior since
   the days of St. Paul; yet the Rev. Sidney Smith, a clergyman of the
   same church as that to which Wesley and Whitefield belonged, and a
   writer of great celebrity, but expressed the estimate in which they
   were held by their fellow clergymen, when he said: "They were men of
   considerable talent; they observed the common decorums of life; they
   did not run naked into the streets or pretend to the prophetical
   character; and therefore they were not committed to Newgate. They
   preached with great energy to weak people, who first stared, then
   listened--then believed--then felt the inward feeling of grace, and
   became as foolish as their teachers could possibly wish them to be;--in
   short, folly ran its ancient course;--and human nature evinced itself
   to be what it always has been, under similar circumstances. The great
   and permanent cause, therefore, of Methodism, is the cause which has
   given birth to fanaticism in all ages--the facility of mingling human
   errors with the fundamental truths of religion."

   In our day we see that which we deem essential to holiness purposely
   omitted in instructions upon this subject. Popular sins are, to say the
   least, silently tolerated. During the war of the rebellion, [Civil War]
   in a popular meeting for the promotion of holiness, in the city of New
   York, Rev. D. F. Newton thanked the Lord for President Lincoln's
   Emancipation Proclamation. He was at once called to order for
   introducing a topic calculated to disturb the harmony of the meeting.
   There are many works on the subject of holiness, written in the days of
   slave-holding to circulate among slave-holders, and not a word to be
   found in them condemning the practice. The same spirit which led to
   silence respecting the sin of slave-holding in the days when all the
   popular churches welcomed slave-holders to their communion, today
   utterly ignores the existence of sins which God's word plainly
   condemns; but which the leading churches openly tolerate. That which
   encourages what God forbids is not holiness. The name of a thing does
   not give it its nature.

   There is a powerful secret society, spreading itself throughout the
   country, composed largely of unbelievers, to which, however, many
   ministers and church-members belong. This society is thoroughly
   anti-Christian in its character. To pray in the lodge in the name of
   Christ is declared by the highest Masonic authority, to be a violation
   of the fundamental principles of Masonry. The members bind themselves
   by the most horrid oaths to submit to be murdered, and to conceal, and
   even commit murder under certain circumstances. Of these facts any
   intelligent person can easily satisfy himself beyond the shadow of a
   doubt. Yet in many meetings held for the promotion of holiness, to
   point out these hindrances to the work of holiness would be considered
   impertinent and fanatical.

   Again the persecution to which the saints of God have always been
   subjected shows that holiness is not recognized when seen. The word
   declares,


   "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
   persecution."--II Tim. 3:12.

   This persecution varies in its form with the prevailing spirit of the
   age. But whatever shape it assumes, persecution never assigns as its
   reason, the godliness of its victims. Their obstinacy, or contumacy, or
   disloyalty, or heresy is assigned as the cause of their sufferings.
   Christ was put to death as an impostor. Luther was excommunicated as a
   heretic, and Wesley and Whitefield were hunted as fanatics. Their
   persecutors were the professed children of God, and they believed it to
   be a zeal for holiness which instigated their opposition to those who
   furnished bright examples of holiness in their lives.

   On the other hand, there are those who make holiness comprise
   attributes which are entirely beyond the reach of a human being in our
   present condition. They give a meaning to the term which the Scriptures
   do not warrant. According to their standard, a holy person cannot make
   a mistake in judgment, either through ignorance or misapprehension. He
   must not only do right as he understands it, but do right as they
   understand it, under all circumstances. They measure others by their
   own infallibility. They make no allowance for lack of judgment or for
   imperfect training. He who professes holiness, must be according to
   their views, beyond the reach of unfriendly criticism. In addition to
   all this, he must never fall. Should he ever afterward manifest any
   disposition contrary to his profession, it is then assumed that all
   along he was either deceived or hypocritical. If he lost holiness, the
   conclusion is not only that he never had holiness, but that no one ever
   did or ever will! In short holiness is pronounced unattainable because
   some who appeared once to have attained it did not persevere to the
   end.

   Thus a false standard of holiness is raised, and then holiness is
   declared to be an impossibility, because no one is found to come up to
   this imaginary standard. We are told to aim our arrow at the sun, and
   then are ridiculed because we fall short of the mark. The moral
   perfections of God are presented as our standard, and then we are
   gravely told that we cannot attain it
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 3

  NATURE OF HOLINESS

   God is a Being of infinite power. He is dependent upon none. All power
   is derived from Him.

   He is also a Being of infinite holiness. This includes all moral
   perfections. Says Tillotson, "In him there can be no malice, or envy,
   or hatred, or revenge, or pride, or cruelty, or tyranny, or injustice,
   or falsehood, or unfaithfulness; and if there be any thing besides
   which implies sin, and vice, and moral imperfection, holiness signifies
   that the divine nature is at an infinite distance from it."

   "The holiness of God," says Edwards, "is the same with the moral
   excellence of the divine nature, or his purity and beauty as a moral
   agent, comprehending all his moral perfections, his righteousness,
   faithfulness, and goodness." His superiority to all false gods, or
   imaginary deities is found in His moral perfections.


   "Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?"--Ex. 15:11.
   "There is none Holy as the Lord."--I Sam. 2:2. "The Lord is righteous
   in all his ways, and holy in all his works."--Ps. 145:17. "Holy, holy,
   holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory."--Isa.
   6:3.

   This is the nature of the God we worship.

   Holiness in man is derived. It is not original, nor innate. It is the
   image of God's holiness. It resembles His holiness, though it falls
   infinitely short of it. A tumbler of water taken from the ocean,
   possesses the same chemical properties as that which remains, though it
   has not the sublimity, or grandeur, or power of the ocean; so a holy
   man possesses in a limited degree, the hatred of sin, the sincerity,
   the veracity, the justice, the love, the goodness, and all the other
   virtues which constitute in all their fullness the holiness of God.


   "Put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and
   true holiness."--Eph. 4:24.

   "What then," says John Wesley, "is that holiness, which is the only
   qualification for glory? In Christ Jesus;" (that is according to the
   Christian Institution, whatever be the case of the heathen world,)
   "neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision." It
   first, through the energy of God, worketh love to God and all mankind;
   and by this love, every holy and heavenly temper--in particular
   lowliness, meekness, gentleness, temperance, and long-suffering. It is
   neither circumcision--the attending on all the Christian ordinances,
   nor uncircumcision--the fulfilling of all heathen morality,--but the
   keeping the commandments of God; particularly this: "Thou shalt love
   the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself;" in a
   word, holiness is having the mind that was in Christ, and walking as
   Christ walked."

   No matter how much refinement or self-government a man may acquire by
   discipline, self-control is not true holiness. Some of the old heathen
   philosophers lived according to the most rigid rules of morality.

   Here is found one fault of much that is taught for holiness in these
   days. It strives to make men do better, without telling them how to be
   better. It lays great stress upon their doing holy things, without
   insisting upon their being holy. The practical part of Christianity is
   required of men, without their being taught that they must have its
   inward experience. The order that Christ established is reversed. The
   effort is perseveringly put forth to make an evil tree bring forth good
   fruit. The person whom Wesley describes as an "almost Christian" would,
   according to the modern theology, be readily accepted as in the
   enjoyment of holiness. Wesley himself, before he was, according to his
   own statement, converted to God, might sit as the model for the modern
   saint. He gave largely; he was strict in his devotional exercises, and
   denied himself very rigidly, that he might have to give to the poor.
   Said a popular Methodist preacher from the pulpit in our hearing: "I
   thank God the time has come when men's piety is estimated, not by what
   they profess, but by what they give." In the middle ages warriors,
   whose hands were red with blood, who had plundered cities by the score,
   and laid whole countries waste, endeavored to atone for their crimes,
   by building magnificent cathedrals; and these were accepted by the
   priesthood as acts and evidences of piety. We are going back to the
   theology of the tenth century. In the largest denomination of the land,
   their chief Theological Seminary for the instruction of the future
   preachers of the church, was built and endowed by one who is notorious
   as a stock gambler, and whose business transactions are condemned by
   even the lax, Wall Street morality. In the next largest denomination,
   the most popular female college was, in like manner, built and endowed
   by one of the heaviest brewers of the country. The influence of these
   illustrious examples, is felt in almost every country church. Property
   controls the pew, and property controls the pulpit. Mammon is the chief
   minister in Christ's kingdom. The affairs of the church are conducted
   upon the same business principles as those which control other
   successful corporations. Experimental piety is branded as fanaticism,
   which in the poor is not to be endured, and in the rich is only
   tolerated as a necessary evil.

   All this comes from the efforts to build a Christian character with
   self as the foundation. The seeming success is but a splendid failure.
   The glittering structure will not stand the first flash of the fires of
   eternity.

   A holy nature comes from God.--Wesley expresses the true sentiment when
   he sings:

   "I want thy life, thy purity, Thy righteousness brought in."

   It must be "brought in" to the heart by power divine; it is not there
   by nature. "The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven hid in the meal."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 4

  PROPERTIES OF HOLINESS

   Gold has the same properties in all countries, by whatever name it may
   be called. The nature of love and of hatred never changes with the
   lapse of time. Holiness may present different manifestations in
   different circumstances, but its qualities are as unchanging as its
   Author. The views of men may vary, but it never varies. Examine it in
   detail or view it as a whole, its qualities never change.

   The indistinct notions which many entertain of holiness, are owing to
   the fact, that they have never seriously considered what it is which
   constitutes holiness. They are like one who knows nothing of gold but
   its color, and is therefore ready to call every thing gold which looks
   like it. He who has any skill in the metals, is not so imposed upon. If
   he finds one of the required qualities, he searches for another, and
   not until he finds that a metal possesses all the properties that it
   should, does he pronounce it gold. So if you have holiness, you have
   all those moral qualities, which taken together, form that grand total
   of Christian graces, which the word of God denominates holiness. Let us
   look at some of these qualities.

   We will first notice some of the things from which holiness implies
   deliverance. This is the more necessary, because the self-indulgent
   spirit which wealth and luxury always beget, Jays stress upon a few of
   the positive properties of holiness; without insisting upon laying
   aside every thing which is inconsistent with it. But the Bible has
   quite as much to say about the negative, as about the positive side of
   holiness. The first commandment reads,


   "Thou shalt have no other gods before me."--Ex. 20:3.

   It was not enough to worship the true God--this, Solomon did, even in
   his backslidden state; but no false god must be worshipped. Of the ten
   commandments, nine contain negative provisions. They tell us what we
   shall not do. Nine prohibitions in the Ten Commandments, and but two
   positive precepts! From this we might infer that God sees that there is
   much greater difficulty in keeping us from doing wrong, than there is
   in leading us, in other respects, to do right. "Herod heard John gladly
   and did many things," but he would not put away the woman with whom be
   was unlawfully living.

   "Cease to do evil; learn to do well" (Isa. 1:16), is God's order. To
   require this, makes trouble. The Romans never scrupled to add another
   go to their Pantheon. They would readily have admitted Christ to that
   honor. But when the uncompromising Apostles demanded that their false
   gods should first be dethroned, Christ was rejected, and his disciples
   thrown to the wild beasts and to the flames. It was not the purity. so
   much as the intolerance of Christianity, that stirred up the fierce
   opposition which it encountered. The martyrs would have avoided their
   fate, if in addition to worshipping Christ they would have consented to
   worship Jupiter and Minerva. But they not only maintained that
   Christianity was true, but that it was exclusively true. They not only
   preached that, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;" but
   that "he that believeth not shall be damned." They were bold to
   declare, "Neither is there salvation in any other." No terrors could
   induce them to join in the cry, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians," or
   swear by the image of Csar. It was this opposition to all that was
   false, that brought them into trouble wherever they went.

   In general, then, holiness implies deliverance from sin. It is the
   opposite of sin, as light is of darkness.

   The Bible teaches us the possibility of having every wrong propensity
   of the soul destroyed. We are aware that some passages look, at the
   first view, as though the continuance of sin in the soul was
   unavoidable. Let us give the more prominent of these a careful and
   candid examination. The first to which we call attention is found in I
   Kings 8:46.--" If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that
   sinneth not.)" In the original Hebrew, the word that is translated
   "sinneth," is in the future tense. "This tense," says Stuart, in his
   Hebrew Grammar, page 207, designates all those shades of meaning which
   we express in English by the auxiliaries may, can, must, might, could,
   should, would," etc. Thus "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
   garden."--Gen. 3:2. The term "may eat," is, in the original, in the
   future tense. So, also,


   "That they may fear thee."--I Kings 8:40.

   The phrase, "may fear," is in the future tense in the Hebrew. The same
   is true of the phrase, "may know," in the forty-third verse, "That all
   the people of the earth may know thy name." Hence, a literal
   translation of the forty-sixth verse would read: "If they sin against
   thee, (for there is no man that may not sin.)" This teaches, not that
   every man does actually and necessarily sin, but that every one is
   liable to sin. It is possible that he may, but not necessary that he
   should sin. So, also, the supposition, "if they sin," implies that they
   might sin, or they might not. It expresses a contingency that could not
   exist if sin were unavoidable. That they might not sin, is clearly
   implied in the declaration that if they did, God would be angry with
   them, and deliver them into the hands of their enemies, so that they
   should be carried into captivity. But as this was not necessary, it
   follows that it was not necessary that they should sin.

   Most of the above remarks will apply to the passage found in Eccl.
   7:20,--"For there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and
   sinneth not." The word, "sinneth," is, in the original, in the future
   tense, and should also be rendered, "may sin." This passage teaches the
   doctrine that runs all through the Bible, that we are never secure from
   the danger of falling. In our best estate, when grace has done the most
   for us, we have great need to "watch that we enter not into
   temptation," to "keep our bodies under, and bring them into
   subjection," lest we should "become castaways."


   "Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
   sin."--Prov. 20:9.

   This passage is intended to reprove the boasting of a self-righteous,
   conceited Pharisee, who not only claims a goodness he does not possess,
   but ascribes his fancied purity to himself. If we offer up, in fervent
   desire, and a faith that will not be denied, the prayer of David:
   "Create in me a clean heart, O God," who shall say this prayer will not
   be answered? God alone is able to unify the soul. It is only by coming
   to Him in importunate supplication that we can obey the Apostle's
   direction,


   "Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purify your hearts, ye
   double-minded."--James 4:8.

   In this way alone can God's command be met.--


   "O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be
   saved."--Jer. 4:14.


   "If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me; if I say I am
   perfect, it shall also prove me perverse."--Job 9:20.

   In this chapter Job treats of the majesty and holiness of God. In the
   15th verse he says: "Whom though I were righteous, yet would I not
   answer, but I would make supplication to my Judge." Before the purity
   of God he counted his righteousness as nothing, however he might lift
   up his head in the presence of his fellow man. Thus, in the verse
   above, we understand Job to say: "If I justify myself (before God) ;
   mine own mouth," in the prayers that I make for the mercy of the Lord,
   "shall condemn me." He did justify himself most triumphantly before
   man, and repelled the accusations which his friends, unable to
   reconcile his afflictions with the supposition of his innocence, had
   brought against him. If I say, "I am perfect" in God's sight, of
   myself, "it shall also prove me perverse." His perfect humility, here
   manifested, justifies the testimony that the Lord, who cannot be
   deceived, gives in his favor.


   "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in
   the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and
   escheweth evil."--Job 1:8 "Who can bring a clean thing out of an
   unclean? Not one."--Job 14:4

   This text refers to the natural depravity that belongs to every one
   that is born into the world-to what is commonly termed original sin. It
   teaches that all are by nature depraved, not that this depravity
   -cannot be removed by grace.

   The Septuagint--the Greek version of the Old Testament, from which our
   Saviour and the Apostles generally quoted, thus renders it: "For who is
   pure from corruption? Not one, although his life upon earth be one
   day."


   "Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips."--Isa.
   6:5.

   This is true of all while in their natural, unsanctified condition, yet
   let us read on and we shall see that the SPIRIT OF GOD, represented by
   "a live coal" "from off the altar" touched his lips, "so that his
   iniquity was taken away," and his "sin was purged."


   "All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags." Isa. 64:6.

   The Jews were exceedingly corrupted in the days of Isaiah. The prophet
   being humbled and alarmed at the general wickedness of his people,
   confesses it in the first person, as ministers generally do on such
   occasions. It is the hypocritical professions of the Jews--a strict
   observance of the forms and ceremonies of religion while living in
   sin--that the prophet compares to filthy rags.


   "I am carnal, sold under sin."--Rom. 7: 14.

   In this connection, the Apostle speaks of his inward experience:

   1. As an unawakened Jew: "I was alive without the law once."

   2. As a converted sinner: "But when the commandment came" to my
   comprehension, "sin revive, and I died;" my hopes perished.

   3. As a believer in Christ: "For the law of the Spirit of life in
   Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death." Now,
   "being made free from sin," and become truly the "servant of God," he
   had his "fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life."

   That the Apostle, in the above passage, refers to himself prior to his
   conversion, is the opinion of President Edwards, a Congregationalist
   divine, who for learning and piety, and philosophical acumen, never had
   a superior in this country; who says: "The Apostle Paul, speaking of
   what he was naturally, says, I am carnal, sold under sin." '


   "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
   not in us." I John 1:8.

   That this refers to man in his natural condition, is evident. The
   apostle is speaking about the power of Jesus' blood that cleanses us
   from all sin. It is those who, falsely and dangerously trusting to
   their own morality and their naturally amiable dispositions, say that
   they do not need to be "cleansed from sin," to whom the Apostle applies
   the above verse. But, being convinced that we are sinners, both by
   nature and by practice, he assures us that,


   "if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins, and to CLEANSE US FROM ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS."--I John 1:9.

   These we believe are the strongest passages ever brought forward to
   prove the necessary continuance of sin. Look at them candidly, and you
   will be satisfied that we have given their true meaning. Let us ask,
   beloved reader, are you at the present time saved from sin? You may
   have been once. That cannot help you now. It only makes your condition
   still more deplorable, if you are still under the dominion of sin. Seek
   deliverance at once. Give no quarters. Let every sin die. That is a
   false holiness which does not deliver from all sin. Salvation from sin
   can alone secure salvation in Heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 5

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--DELIVERANCE FROM PRIDE

   The heart is the seat of sin. Actions derive their moral character from
   the disposition with which they are performed To give a sum of money
   may be an act of benevolence, or it may be bribery,--it may spring from
   love to Christ, or from love of the praise of men.


   "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
   adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness,
   deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. All
   these evil things come from within, and defile the man."--Mark 7:
   21-24.

   A justified soul does not yield to sin.


   "Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin." I John 3:9

   A soul sanctified to God wholly does not have sin.


   "But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship
   one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us
   from all sin."--I John 1:7

   True holiness will save one from sins that are popular, just as readily
   as from those that are disgraceful. It is the work of the Spirit. With
   God, the standard of right does not vary. Selfish considerations lead
   men to tolerate, sometimes one sin, and sometimes another. A few years
   ago, many of the advocates of holiness had nothing to say against the
   sin of slave-holding. The Church gained by it in numbers and resources.
   How, many take no decided stand against pride and worldly conformity.
   They have not a word to utter in condemnation of conspiracies of the
   strong against the weak. But those who really aim at being right with
   God, turn from every thing which He has forbidden, even though it is
   encouraged by the Church.

   Holiness implies deliverance from pride. A holy person cannot feel
   proud. A holy Church cannot indulge in pride. Pride cannot dwell in a
   holy soul.


   "Him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer."--Ps.
   101:5


   "Be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace
   to the humble."--I Peter 5:5

   In this particular, the Roman Catholics are a reproof to the
   Protestants. To all who are loyal to the Church, the Catholics give the
   largest latitude of word and action--of business and pleasure. To keep
   within the bonds of decency and morality is all that is required of the
   ordinary members of her communion. You will find among them, ladies as
   gaily dressed as any that the times can furnish. But they do not
   profess holiness. Their priests may err in many things, but they do not
   encourage their people to think that they can become saints, while
   indulging in pride to the fullest extent that their means will allow.
   They are taught that if they would become holy, pride must be
   renounced, and all appearance of pride must be laid aside. But in
   Protestant churches, you will find persons advocating holiness, whose
   appearance unmistakably declares that pride reigns within. Their costly
   apparel, their ornaments of gold, their affected tones, their whole
   bearing, proclaim that there has been no real renunciation of the vain
   pomp and glory of the world. This is all wrong, and altogether wrong.

   It may be urged that such a course recommends holiness; that it leads
   the rich and the refined to embrace it. But this is a mistake. It may
   lead them to embrace a delusion,--to believe that they are sanctified,
   when they are not even scripturally awakened. That, which is thus
   recommended, is not holiness. It may have some of its properties, but
   the essentials are wanting. To make people believe that they can so put
   on Christ's righteousness as to set off their own purple and fine linen
   to better advantage, is to make them believe a ruinous lie. Contraries
   cannot dwell together. Pride and humility can not reign at once in the
   same heart. Then do not deceive, even for so good an object as the
   promotion of holiness. The Saviour has commanded us to count the cost.
   Until men can see that holiness is more to be desired than all which
   they are required to give up, they will never obtain it.

   "But," many urge, "we should have pride enough to be decent." There is
   no pride in Heaven. But there is purity. So we may have inward and
   outward purity, without pride. Pride is a result of the fall. It had no
   place in Eden. It should have none in all our hearts. Seek then for
   that holiness which roots it out entirely.

   You may make a consecration to the Lord ever so full in other respects,
   but if it does not include the giving up of your pride in all its
   forms, you will not get an experience which will enable you to do the
   will of God. And just in proportion as you give up pride and long for
   deliverance from it, just in that proportion will God take it from your
   heart. It is a dangerous foe--give it no quarter. It is a subtle foe,
   lying in ambush for your overthrow--give it no place for concealment.

   Holiness implies deliverance from pride, as manifested in the provision
   which we make for our children. Pride is one of the sad effects of the
   fall. It will manifest itself in some form or other in our children,
   until they are brought completely under the influence of divine grace.
   But parents, who are wholly sanctified to God, will not give it any
   encouragement. It needs no fostering. Do what you can to prevent it;
   from the atmosphere around, it will drink in enough nourishment to grow
   with alarming rapidity. Cut it back all you may, and with each coming
   season it will put forth new vigor, and manifest the utmost tenacity of
   life. As long as you find in yourself a disposition to encourage
   display in your children,--to fit them up to shine with worldly
   splendor, you may rest assured that the work of holiness in yourself is
   not yet complete. You are not fully delivered from pride.

   Holiness implies deliverance from denominational pride. There are many
   who dress plain, and who furnish their houses plain, who will
   nevertheless give their thousands towards the construction of a church,
   when every accommodation could be secured for one-third the amount paid
   for its construction. Two-thirds of all that is paid for our fine
   houses of worship, is expended for display, and answers no purpose
   except to gratify pride. One denomination builds a fine church. The
   next one that builds puts forth every possible exertion to surpass it
   in magnificence. To raise money, festivals and lotteries are resorted
   to, and in some cases, downright dishonesty is practiced. The fine
   church must be filled with finely dressed people, and so pride and
   extravagance are encouraged and the poor virtually excluded from the
   house of worship. If the true Gospel course were taken by all who call
   themselves by the Christian name,--if the money expended to gratify
   pride were judiciously employed in spreading the truth as it is in
   Jesus, the time would soon come when it could be said in all parts of
   the world,


   "The poor have the Gospel preached to them."--Matt. 11:5.

CHAPTER 6

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--UNSELFISHNESS

   When the angel announced the coming of the Saviour, he said,


   "Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from
   their sins."--Matt. 1:21

   This, then, is the grand peculiarity of the disciples of Christ, they
   are a saved people. By nature they are no better than others. Grace
   makes them to differ. And the grand distinction is found in what they
   are saved from. There are dispositions and appetites which in
   themselves are sinful. They answer no good purpose. They were not a
   part of man's nature at the beginning. They result from the fall. No
   one is sanctified wholly till he is saved from these depraved
   dispositions and appetites.

   Holiness implies deliverance from selfishness. A selfish person cannot,
   at the same time, be a holy person. Selfishness is that disposition
   which prompts us to seek our own interests or our own gratification
   without due regard to the rights or happiness of others. The second
   great commandment is,


   "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."--Matt. 19:19

   This certainly supposes that we are, within proper limits, to love
   ourselves. The Scriptures not only allow, but command us, to have a due
   regard for our own happiness. Every promise of the Bible is based upon
   the principle that it is right for us, within proper limitations, to
   pursue our own welfare. Abraham, in going out from his father's house,


   "Looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is
   God."--Heb. 11:10

   Moses, in giving up the treasures and honors of Egypt, "had respect to
   the recompense of reward."--Heb. 11:26

   But this principle so proper in itself must be carefully regulated and
   kept within the bounds which God has prescribed or it becomes sinful
   and pernicious. Self-love takes into account the whole of our existence
   for time and for eternity. Selfishness looks at present interest and
   present gratification. Self-love has due respect for the happiness of
   others; selfishness inclines us to seek our own gratification without
   regard to the duties which we owe, either to God or to our neighbor.
   Self-love is a principle which God gave man for his own preservation:
   selfishness is the sinful substitute which man at the fall adopted. The
   one is the alcohol which maddens: the other is the corn that gives
   strength and the delicious grape that gives health to man.

   There is scarcely a crime which man commits, or a sin of which he is
   guilty, which does not originate in selfishness. It is the bitter
   fountain in which every corrupt stream has its source. It is the evil
   tree which bears every manner of pernicious fruit. It is a vice that is
   never satisfied; it grows by what it feeds upon. The more it is
   gratified, the more inordinate are its cravings. It becomes most
   intense when there is least apology for its existence. It has the
   utmost tenacity of life, and never dies a natural death. It can be
   slain, only by the Sword of the Spirit--it can be destroyed only by the
   fire of the Holy Ghost. It can wear out the strongest constitution, but
   it is never worn out itself. It exists under a thousand different
   forms, and in every state of society. The most refined, and the most
   highly educated, are as much under its influence as the most ignorant
   and uncultivated.

   Popular churches sanction and foster this selfish spirit, in selling,
   or renting the seats in their houses of worship. The rich man, if saved
   from selfishness, would not want, on account of his riches, better
   accommodations in the house of God, than his poorer brother. The rich
   and the poor would meet together as brethren, feeling that the Lord is
   the Maker of us all.

   Every effort to raise money for religious or benevolent purposes by
   means of fairs, festivals, or similar contrivances, is an appeal to
   selfishness. Thus the sanction of the Church is given to a corrupt
   principle which underlies all wickedness and saps the very foundation
   of the Christian character. It fosters that for the extirpation of
   which it should put forth its mightiest energies.

   Years ago, when we were first brought into the experience of the
   blessing of holiness, and began to realize something of its importance,
   we saw clearly that the enjoyment of this grace could never become
   general in a church, so long as pews were rented, and fairs held for
   the benefit of the finances of the church. We took our stand firmly
   against all these appeals to selfishness, as standing in the way of the
   great work of the Church of Christ--the spreading of Scriptural
   holiness throughout the land.

   Holiness and Selfishness cannot dwell together. When the Spirit was
   poured out, upon the opening of the Christian dispensation, the selfish
   spirit was utterly rooted out,


   "And all that believed had all things common; and sold their
   possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had
   need." Acts 2:44, 45.

   Whether this is, or is not, to be regarded as a model for Christians,
   in all ages, to follow, it is certainly a specimen of the spirit which
   Christian holiness is to produce. It is an extirpation of the selfish
   principle.

   To this end are such precepts and declarations as these:


   "Let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not every man on
   his own things, but every man also on the things of others."--Phil.
   2:3, 4. "For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to
   himself."--Rom. 14:7. "But to do good and to communicate, forget not;
   for with such sacrifices God is well pleased."--Heb. 13:1 "Bear ye one
   another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."--Gal. 6:2. "Set
   your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."--Col. 3:2.

CHAPTER 7

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--CONTROL OF APPETITES

   True holiness has its influence on every part of our nature. It affects
   for good every member of the body, and every faculty of the mind. It
   produces symmetry of character.

   Holiness gives to its possessor control over all his bodily appetites.
   He has appetites. The Saviour, who was holiness itself in bodily form,
   had them. He was hungry and thirsty. The natural appetites were given
   us for a good purpose. They are not in themselves sinful. But they are
   to be kept within proper bounds. They were not intended to be our
   masters. They must be regulated and controlled. They are to be brought
   into subjection to reason, to conscience and the word of God. No holy
   person can be under the dominion of appetite. He is delivered from this
   bondage.

   One who is holy never indulges his appetites in an unlawful manner. He
   will starve before he will steal.


   "I know," says the Apostle, "both how to be abased, and I know how to
   abound, every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full
   and to be hungry; both to abound and to suffer need."--Phil. 4:12.

   The Saviour, when he was hungry after having fasted forty days, would
   not obtain bread in the manner suggested by the devil. We should follow
   this example. No matter how strong may be the cravings of appetite, or
   to what straits we may be reduced, we should remember that there is
   something more to be considered than simply whether what is presented
   will assuage hunger, or satisfy thirst. Have I the right to it? Can I
   obtain the right on conditions with which I may lawfully comply? Esau
   did not steal, but he sold his birthright to obtain means to gratify
   his hunger. Many do the same today. The bodily appetites clamor for
   indulgence. Satan offers to gratify them on condition of some service
   rendered to him,--as breaking the Sabbath, catering to the vices of
   others, preaching the Gospel in such a manner as to throw out of sight
   the cross and the self-denial. A holy person will suffer the pangs of
   hunger before he will obtain his bread by any of these methods. If he
   will not resort to these means to keep from starving, of course he will
   not for any other purpose.

   True holiness will give one such control over his appetites that he
   will not indulge them in an inordinate degree. He eats to live, but
   does not live to eat. His tastes are simple and natural. His wants are
   easily satisfied. He who spends large sums of money to gratify his own
   pampered tastes, while so many are perishing of want, may be orthodox
   and polite, but he is not holy. No matter though he can afford to be
   "clothed in purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day," yet
   he sees representatives of Christ in the destitute around him, and he
   denies himself of luxuries that he may minister to their necessities.
   Church festivals, to raise money, are open to this, among other
   objections. They educate the people to make self-gratification a
   stronger motive to action than duty to God, and to our fellow men. They
   assume that Christians will do more for their stomachs' sake than they
   will for conscience' sake. They take it for granted that they care more
   for their own sensual enjoyment, than they do for the claims of God, or
   the sufferings of their fellow men.

   True holiness saves those who enjoy it from all unnatural, depraved
   appetites which have been formed by a course of sinful indulgence. Such
   is man's depravity that he forms appetites at which his physical nature
   at first revolts. After a time the indulgence of these appetites is
   attended with momentary enjoyment. Such is the use of opium, tobacco
   and ardent spirits. No one likes them at first. They frequently make
   beginners sick. But they stimulate the nervous system, and create an
   excitement which affords a certain degree of pleasure. When this
   excitement passes off, it is followed by a corresponding degree of
   languor and depression. This soon becomes so insupportable that the
   stimulant must be had at any cost. An appetite is formed that the
   victims will gratify at the expense of every thing which men hold dear.
   Property, friends, reputation, standing, health, and even life itself
   are sacrificed to gratify an appetite which brutalizes and enslaves.
   The only safe course is to avoid the beginning. But for those who
   sincerely repent of their wickedness in forming and feeding such an
   appetite, God provides a remedy. The promise,


   "If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins
   and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness,"--I John 1:9

   covers this ground. The appetite for either of the stimulants named,
   cannot be godly--this no one contends. It cannot be indifferent,--it is
   of too positive a character. It is an unrighteousness,--both its nature
   and its effects proclaim this. That it is true of the appetite for
   opium and the appetite for ardent spirits is generally conceded. No one
   will maintain that a drunkard is holy.


   "This ye know, that no drunkard shall inherit the kingdom of God."--I
   Cor. 10:6

   But an habitual tobacco user is as clearly condemned by the Scriptures,
   as is the one who habitually uses ardent spirits as a beverage. His
   habit involves, of necessity, personal filthiness. But we are commanded
   to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh, and of the
   Spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord. We readily admit
   that the works of holiness may be begun in the heart of a person who
   uses tobacco. But it cannot go on and this habit continue. One or the
   other will cease. He will cease to advance in holiness, or he will
   abandon his unholy habits. No person can perfect holiness without
   cleansing himself from all filthiness of the flesh, as well as of the
   Spirit.

   Again, we are commanded to eat and drink to the glory of God (I Cor.
   10:31). We do this when we eat temperately, and such things as do not
   injure us or others. But it is a fact, as clearly established as any
   fact can be, that the habitual use of tobacco breaks down the nervous
   system, and brings on many diseases. No man,. immoderately addicted to
   the use of tobacco, can retain his mental vigor, and his bodily
   soundness, as he could without it. No one, seeing a professed Christian
   smoking or chewing, will think any more highly of the Christian
   religion on that account. It is an act, to say the least, in which God
   is not glorified.

   No man has the right to spend the Lord's money in this way. It is God
   who gives the power to get wealth. It should be used to advance His
   cause,--to make men better,--to relieve their wants and instruct them
   in the way of life. A Christian man cannot spend his money as he wills,
   but must use it as the Lord wills.

   But there is little use in multiplying words on this subject. Those who
   are really in earnest to gain Heaven, and who are willing to meet the
   conditions of salvation, cannot fail to see the necessity of denying
   themselves of the gratification of an appetite formed in sin, the
   indulgence of which can do no good, but must eventually result in much
   harm. Those who make religion a mere matter of convenience, or fashion,
   would not be convinced any way, and it would do no good if they were.
   It is useless to talk against idols, to men who are joined to their
   idols. But to those who have formed this appetite, and wish to be
   delivered from it, we say holiness will do it. Seek earnestly to be
   delivered from bondage to your animal nature, and you shall be
   delivered. You will become spiritual by becoming holy.


   "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
   God."--Rom. 8:14.

   But if you are a slave to your appetites, do not profess holiness. If
   you do, you have no reason to expect that your profession will be
   received. Holiness is a radical work. It changes us in our appetites.
   The things that we once loved we now hate. Old things are passed away
   and behold all things are become new.

   Give yourself no rest until this thorough work is wrought in you. Seek
   to have the blood of cleansing applied to every part of your nature.
   Look to be sanctified wholly, and believe that


   "Faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it."--I Thess. 5:24.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 8

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--LOVE

   Holiness implies deliverance from all hatred of any human being.
   Personal enmities--either open or avowed, or subtle and secret have a
   place, to a greater or less extent, in the hearts of men generally.
   Professing Christians scarcely form an exception. One interferes with
   our plans and purposes, and defeats our projects. As long as any
   selfishness remains in the soul, dislike is sure to follow. His actions
   are commented upon with severity, an unfavorable construction is put
   upon whatever he does and says, until he comes to be regarded with
   feelings of positive aversion. A truly sanctified soul has no sympathy
   with sin,--he abhors it; but he looks upon the sinner with sincere
   compassion.

   In this respect, the supernatural character of Christianity is
   manifested. It is natural to return hatred for hatred. But holiness
   causes one to return good for evil, blessing for cursing, love for
   hatred. The teachings of Christ on this point are plain and
   unequivocal.--


   "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor,
   and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them
   that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that
   despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of
   your Father which is in heaven; for he maketh his sun to rise on the
   evil and on the good, and sendeth his rain on the just and on the
   unjust. For if you love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
   not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only,
   what do ye more than others Do not even the publican so? Be ye
   therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is
   perfect."--Matt. 5:43-48

   This implies deliverance from all active hostility. It is deserving of
   notice that when the Apostle prays for the sanctification of believers,
   his prayer is addressed to the God of peace.


   "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly."--I Thess. 5:23

   The God of peace never gives the spirit of war. Whoever He sanctifies
   is made partaker of His peace. All animosities are buried.--Old
   enmities are forgotten. If you are thus made holy, you will forgive
   those who have wronged you. And what is still harder, you forgive those
   whom you have wronged. Instead of attempting to justify yourself by
   making them appear, both to yourself and others, as bad as possible,
   you take the blame to yourself, and confess it, and make everything
   right as far as it is in your power to do so. While you are by no means
   cowardly, you are no longer full of fight. You do not avail yourself of
   every opportunity to assail others when it can apparently be done to
   advantage. You do not strive for the mastery over others. If they
   assail you the assault is not returned. You do not return railing for
   railing, but contrariwise, blessing.

   A holy person is saved from that modification of hatred usually
   denominated prejudice. It matters not whether it be individual,
   sectarian, or national, holiness removes it from the heart. At a
   camp-meeting which we attended, a young lady at the opening of the
   meeting, made a clear profession of holiness. She was active, but not
   forward. The light shone clearly, and she welcomed the light. In a
   short time she was among the most earnest seekers of a clean heart. She
   felt right in every particular but one. She had a prejudice against her
   stepmother, whom she had said she never would like.--But when the
   blessing came, it removed this feeling entirely. There was none of it
   left. She was willing to reciprocate the love which had been proffered
   her from one whom she ought to love.

   A young man who had warmly espoused the Southern cause, and served in
   the Southern army, became convicted for the blessing of holiness from
   reading some numbers of THE EARNEST CHRISTIAN, which providentially
   fell into his hands. He sought and found full salvation through the
   blood of the Lamb. At a large, outdoor meeting, where hundreds were
   assembled, he felt called to confess what God had done for him. Among
   other things he said that holiness took away all prejudice against the
   Yankees. This was said, not only a the risk of his personal popularity,
   but at the risk of his life. But he had to make and stand by the
   declaration.

   At one of our large meetings in Western New York, a stranger arose and
   said he was a preacher from the central part of the State. He said he
   had heard a great many things against this people, but was determined
   to know about them for himself. Such was the prejudice that he did not
   dare to let his nearest friends--not even his wife--know where he was
   going. "But," said he, "I am satisfied that God is with you. If any
   Christian comes among you, he is sure to love you. If he would keep up
   his prejudices, he must stay away and hate you."

   Another modification of hatred is envy. This is a malignant feeling
   toward others because of their prosperity. It manifests itself in
   little things--such as detracting from the merits of others; making
   efforts to impair their reputation; attributing their success to
   anything that looks plausible, rather than to their own good conduct.
   This spirit is often manifested among professed Christians, ministers
   not excepted. They cannot bear to hear their rival well spoken of. But
   holiness takes this feeling away. We can rejoice with those that do
   rejoice.

   Many are not saved from their enmities, because they do not want to be.
   They hold on to their prejudices as they would to life itself. Yet they
   profess holiness. Such persons are evidently deceived. There can be no
   mistake in the matter. They need to have the Lord circumcise their
   hearts. They are holding on to that which will work their ruin. "A
   little leaven leaveneth the whole lump." If grace does not root out
   malice, malice will kill out grace. The two cannot live together.


   "But now ye also put off all these, anger, wrath, malice, filthy
   communication out of your mouth."--Col. 3:8
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 9

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--HATRED OF SIN

   Holiness is not indifference. One who is truly holy does not feel that
   he has done his duty by simply abstaining from sin. True Holiness is
   not that easy, good-natured disposition that smiles at sin, and gives
   it ample toleration, especially if it is fashionable or popular, or
   capable of being turned to account in "building up the church," that
   is, adding to its numbers or influence. There was a great deal of this
   spurious kind of holiness in this country in the palmy days of slavery.
   You may search volume after volume of its literature deigned for
   circulation in the South, without finding one bold, and outspoken
   denunciation of the sin of slave-holding. You might have attended the
   "holiness meeting," week after week, without hearing one prayer offered
   for the liberation of the slaves, or one testimony borne against the
   "sum of all villainies." No farther south than the city of New York, at
   no later a date than soon after President Lincoln's emancipation
   proclamation, you might have heard a brother called to order in the
   leading "holiness meeting" for thanking God for this proclamation which
   struck the fetters from three millions of bondmen.

   The same kind of holiness is popular today. It valorously kicks the
   dead lion, but is very careful not to excite the anger of the living
   jackal. It hardly gives a passing notice to some of the greatest
   obstacles to the work of holiness in this country. If it mentions them,
   it is done so faintly as scarcely to attract attention. If it objects
   to them, it is in such weak tones as not to displease their most ardent
   votaries. We have attended a holiness camp-meeting without hearing one
   word said in condemnation of the practice now so common among professed
   Christians, of adorning themselves "in gold and pearls and costly
   array." Everything was said in commendation of the beauty of holiness
   and of its exalting influence upon human character, but nothing to show
   the incongruity with it, of that pride which the Bible so strongly
   condemns. It is no uncommon thing to see even advocates of holiness
   adorned in a style that would, fifty years ago, have excluded them from
   the Church whose interests they are now laboring so zealously to
   promote.

   True holiness is not blind. It has eyes to see, and ears to hear. While
   not obtrusive, it is observing. If it does not act the part of a
   detective: it does not assume the ignorance of an accessory. While not
   skeptical, it is not credulous. It does not call every thing gold that
   glitters. It tries those who say they are apostles, and readily
   consents to be tried in turn. It does not accept professions merely
   because the manners are pleasing, and the words are faultless.

   Scriptural holiness implies hatred of sin. This is one of the points in
   which it differs from mere natural amiability. It is not that easy,
   good nature that smiles at vices it would not itself commit. It offers
   a stern resistance to sin in all its guises. It stands like a rock
   against the popular waves of iniquity. It does not give place to the
   devil. Satan cannot have his way undisputed in the presence of
   holiness. It maintains its ground against all odds and under all
   circumstances.


   "The fear of the Lord is to hate evil."--Prov. 8:13 "Ye that love the
   Lord hate evil."--Ps. 97:10

   One who is truly holy hates the first appearance of sin in himself. His
   conscience is as quick as the apple of the eye. A sinful thought, even
   when suggested by Satan and instantly repelled by the mind, gives him
   more uneasiness than a sinful action did before his conscience was
   purged from dead works. The one evil which he dreads above all others
   is sin. He shuns it as he would the open pit to which it leads. He
   cries out with the Psalmist:


   "I hate every false way."--Ps. 119:104.

   And again,


   "I hate vain thoughts, but thy law do I love.--Ps. 119:113

   So Bunyan truly says, "Where the grace of God is in the heart it shows
   itself by inclining the soul to abhor sin."

   He hates sin in others. No matter with what talents, or
   accomplishments, or position it may be joined, he abhors it utterly.
   The popularity of the sinner does not mitigate the repugnance which he
   feels on account of his sins. There is no malice in his hatred, but the
   holy soul feels an instinctive aversion to sin, no matter how polished
   may be its appearance.


   "Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with
   those that rise up against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred: I
   count them mine enemies."--Ps. 1.39:21, 22

   This does not imply angry, malevolent feelings, but a settled aversion
   of soul toward the haters of God. As to his chosen companions, the
   Psalmist says,


   "I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy
   precepts."--Ps. 119:63

   Hatred of sin is essential to the aggressiveness that belongs to the
   Christian character. No disciple of Christ can settle down, and enjoy
   himself, without making any effort to do good to others. He that has
   found Christ will proclaim Christ.


   "Let him that heareth say, Come."--Rev. 22:17


   "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with
   me scattereth abroad."--Matt. 12:30

   But unless one feels a hatred to sin he will not make war upon sin. A
   man who goes to the bar and drinks water, while his friend drinks
   whiskey may be personally temperate; but he certainly cannot be a very
   warm advocate of temperance. It was when Paul saw that the city was
   wholly given, to idolatry that his spirit was stirred within him, and
   he preached to them the true and living God. Luther would never have
   been a reformer, had not his indignation been aroused against the
   sinful practices of the Church. He made war upon the sale of
   indulgences because he hated the sins that were thus encouraged. One
   who sees little or no harm in pride will not insist upon humility. He
   who thinks that a conspiracy of the strong against the weak, the union
   of believers with unbelievers, cemented by the most awful oaths and
   penalties, is a matter of so little importance as not to be worthy to
   be looked into, will not oppose secret societies with any earnestness.

   So of sin in all its manifestations; until it is seen to be "exceeding
   sinful," and hateful, no vigorous effort will be made for its
   overthrow. Revivals will dwindle down into periodical efforts to
   promote the interests of each particular sect, and the converts,
   instead of being made happy in God, will become at best only the
   zealous proselytes of the favorite opinion.

   Hatred of sin will necessarily expose a person to persecution. It
   cannot be otherwise. Satan will never surrender without a struggle. If
   he is attacked he will attack in turn. He will return blow for blow. He
   has no scruples and feels no pity. No lie, if only it is clothed with
   probability, will be too great or glaring for him to employ. No
   character can be too well established for him to assail. When he cannot
   use violence he will make the most of defamation; of all the arts of
   which he is a most consummate master. He is ever the relentless enemy
   of all good. Hence the Apostle declares,


   "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
   persecution." II Tim. 3:12

   This is a general declaration. It applies to all time and all places.
   It must hold good as long as holiness is opposed to sin. No degree of
   wisdom or prudence can enable one to escape this consequence of a godly
   life. If you have met with no persecution it is an alarming symptom. It
   shows that there is an essential element wanting in your religious
   experience. You do not hate sin.

   Hatred to sin secures the comfort of the Holy Ghost. There is no joy
   like that which He imparts.

   "A peace to sensual minds unknown, A joy unspeakable."

   With this in the heart one can go through any thing that in the
   Providence of God he is called upon to suffer or endure. "The joy of
   the Lord is your strength." Yet many professed Christians know nothing
   about this joy. They have never felt it themselves and when they
   witness it in others it looks to them like fanaticism or wild-fire. The
   reason they have never felt it is, they have never been sufficiently
   given up to God to obey Him in every thing, to secure the comfort of
   the Holy Ghost.


   "Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy
   God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy
   fellows."--Ps. 45:7

   Heb. 1:9. To be "anointed with the oil of gladness" it is not enough to
   love righteousness. If you stop there you will not receive it. You must
   go a step farther and become a partaker of so much of the divine
   holiness as will make you hate wickedness. Then, when you take your
   stand against it; when you meet, unmovable as a rock, the billows of
   wickedness, God will pour up on you the oil of gladness to that degree
   that you will not heed the sufferings you will endure for your fidelity
   to Christ. You will have the martyr spirit.

   Hatred to sin will enable you to stand true to God under all
   circumstances. You will not backslide. As long as sin looks odious you
   will not embrace it. While you fight sin in real earnest, because it is
   sin against God, you will not become its friend. It is the half-hearted
   renunciation of sin which causes so many to fall away. Lot, in Sodom,
   maintained his integrity because


   "in seeing and hearing, he vexed his righteous soul from day to day
   with their unlawful deeds."--II Pet. 2:8

CHAPTER 10

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--HONESTY IN BUSINESS

   Honesty is that disposition which prompts us to give to every one his
   due. It makes us thoughtful of the rights of others. Its influence is
   felt in all the relations of life. It makes us more anxious to give to
   others their rights, than we are to insist upon our own. We would
   infinitely prefer to be the victims of injustice, than to be unjust. A
   holy person would a thousand times rather suffer wrong, than do wrong.
   He watches carefully lest others be the losers through his fault. He
   never takes advantage of the ignorance of another. In buying he does
   not decry an article in order to obtain it for less than it is worth in
   selling, he does not conceal defects in order to obtain more for a
   thing than its real value. He freely gives all the information
   necessary to form a correct judgment in the matter. Even the heathen
   standard of honesty did not allow one man to take advantage of the
   ignorance of another. Cicero proposes a case as follows. He says,
   "Antisthenes brings a ship-load of grain to Rhode at a time of great
   scarcity. The Rhodians flock about him to buy. He knows that five other
   ships, laden with grain, will be there tomorrow. Ought he to tell the
   Rhodians this, before he sells his own grain? Undoubtedly he ought,
   otherwise he makes a gain of their ignorance, and so is no better than
   a thief or a robber." You may say, "Business is business, and religion
   is religion," but that does not relieve the matter. The Bible demands
   honesty in business. A holy man regulates and controls his business
   according to the principles of justice. Yet many who profess the holy
   religion of Jesus purposely take advantage of the ignorance of others,
   and so "are no better than thieves and robbers."

   One takes advantage of the necessities of others. Some labor must be
   done or service performed. The want is urgent. Yet he who takes
   advantage of this necessity and extorts an unreasonable price for the
   service rendered, acts precisely upon the principle of the highwayman
   who takes advantage of the traveler's helpless condition and demands
   his money or his life. When we undertake to assist another, though
   there be no stipulation as to the compensation to be received, our
   obligations to God will not allow us to be unreasonable in our
   requirements. We must do as we would be done by.

   Holiness implies honesty between employers and the employed. If I sell
   my time and skill to another; to fail in rendering him the service for
   which I am paid, is, as really an act of dishonesty as to rob his till,
   or steal his goods. So the apostle commands those who are working for
   others to do it


   "in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; not with eye-service, as
   menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from
   the heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to
   men: knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall
   he receive of the Lord."--Eph. 6:6

   The employers are to give servants their due, of taking advantage of
   their wants and getting their service for less than its value; nor
   paying them in that which they do not want. An eminent minister hired a
   young man to work for him through the season. When they settled the
   minister gave him his note. This was satisfactory at the time. But
   circumstances soon after rendered it necessary for the young man to
   return to his friends quite a distance away. The minister, as the
   expression is, "shaved his own note." As far as honesty is concerned he
   might as well have stolen from him that amount.

   In the family relations, in the every day occurrences of life, there is
   need for the constant exercise of this principle. We must "follow
   holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord," not only in the
   Church, but in the family, in the treatment of companion, and children,
   and dependents, in the workshop and on the farm, behind the counter and
   in the office, in meeting obligations and in making bargains, on the
   streets and in the cars, and in all our intercourse with our fellowmen.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 11

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--IMPARTIALITY

   God is no respecter of persons. This does not mean that He regards the
   righteous and the wicked with the same degree of favor. But it does
   mean that He loves a poor man who is truly pious, just as much as He
   does a millionaire or a king who serves Him no better. In the ranks of
   an army, in time of war, are men from every position in life; but there
   are for all the same duties and the same dangers. The road to
   preferment is open to all alike. What is true, in theory at least, in
   the army, is true in fact in the Church of Jesus Christ. The same
   spirit of obedience and self-renunciation is required of all.


   "So whosoever of you he be, that forsaketh not all that he hath, he
   cannot be my disciple"--Luke 14:3

   was not spoken to those only who have not much to forsake. It applies
   with equal force to the prince as to the pauper.

   In proportion as we become holy we become partakers of the mind that
   was in Christ. A holy person will not claim, and accept any privilege
   in the house of God which is conceded to him on account of his wealth,
   but is denied to his poor but equally deserving brother, To him there
   is a depth of meaning in the words of our Saviour;


   "How can ye believe which receive honor one of another, and seek not
   the honor that cometh from God only?"--John 5:44

   He is "a companion"--an equal--"of all them that fear God," (Ps. 119:
   6), and he does not accept any honor bestowed upon him on account of
   the superior worldly advantages he may enjoy.

   Consequently a holy person should not buy or rent a seat in a house of
   worship. To do this would be to give his sanction to a practice which
   shuts the poor out of the house of God, and which introduces into the
   Church an aristocracy based on money.

   Christ says,


   "The poor have the Gospel preached to them."--Matt. 11:5

   This is the standing miracle of the Gospel. False religions seek their
   votaries among the rich and powerful. The Gospel was made for the poor.
   It is adapted to their capacities and their wants. If the rich receive
   it they must come down to a level with the poor. They must lay aside
   their "gold and pearls and costly array" and be clothed upon with
   humility. In all ages the greatest triumphs of the Gospel have been won
   among the poor. Paul, writing to the saints at Corinth, one of the
   proudest cities of his times, said,


   "Ye see your calling; brethren, how that not many wise men after the
   flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called; but God hath chosen
   the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath
   chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are
   mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised
   hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought
   things that are."--I Cor. 1:26-28.

   John Wesley commenced his wonderful career among the poor, and his
   followers were mainly of this class. Were the churches holy, their
   houses of worship would be open for the poor just as freely as for the
   rich, and there would be one communion for all; as there is one God and
   Father of us. An individual who is holy cannot consistently belong to a
   Church that despises the poor. But if grading a congregation according
   to its wealth--giving to the one, who is able and willing to pay the
   most, the best seat, irrespective of his Christian, or even moral
   character, and giving the poor seats by themselves, is not manifesting
   contempt for the poor, we know not how it can be manifested in the
   house of God. True holiness would correct all this. It honors those
   whom God honors. It would make trouble, for those professing
   holiness:--to refuse to give their sanction to the selling of the right
   to hear the Gospel. But this is the nature of holiness--to make trouble
   wherever it comes in contact with sin. Light has no communion with
   darkness, and where one prevails it is to the exclusion of the other.

   God has nowhere promised that holy men should enjoy exemption from
   troubles. But they are promised a final and glorious deliverance.

   If you steadfastly refuse to show respect of persons in judgment, you
   may bring upon yourself persecution; but in no other way can you keep
   clear in your soul. There is a sterling integrity about holiness, which
   refuses to be swerved from righteous judgment by any apprehension of
   danger or expectation of reward. It chooses to


   "suffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the
   pleasures of sin for a season."--Heb. 11:25

   Job says, "The cause which I knew not I searched out." He did not
   accept the popular voice as his verdict. He examined carefully, weighed
   impartially the evidence, and gave a just decision.


   "Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of
   the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor."--Lev.
   19:15
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 12

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--LOVE TO GOD

   There can be no such thing as Christian holiness without supreme love
   to God. This is its very substance. It may be summed up in this. A
   being possessed of the proper intelligence, and actuated at all times
   by supreme love to God, would never be wanting in an duty. Every
   obligation would be fulfilled The GREAT COMMANDMENT is,


   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy
   soul, and with all thy mind."--Matt. 22:37

   A failure here involves failure everywhere. Who is pleased with
   professions of love when convinced that the affection is wanting? So
   Christ assures us that acts of devotion are unutterably loathsome
   unless they spring from love.


   "So then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will
   spew thee out of my mouth."--Rev. 3:16

   Love to God does not differ in its nature from love to our fellows. The
   more pure are our conceptions of the object of our affections, the more
   exalted is the sentiment. God is infinite in all the wonderful
   attributes of His nature; and hence, love to Him is the most exalted
   and ennobling affection of which the human mind is capable. It includes
   delight in Him, desire to enjoy His presence and His approbation, and a
   determination to do His will.


   "For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments."--I John
   5:3

   It is manifested by a desire to please Him. Anything we feel satisfied
   will be pleasing to God, we are anxious to do, although it may involve
   painstaking and self-denial. David's men loved him; and when he
   expressed a longing for water from a well which was within the lines of
   the enemy, and carefully guarded, they sallied forth, and sword in
   hand, obtained it at the risk of their lives. So one who truly loves
   God, will rejoice at any intimation of his ability to perform any
   service acceptable to Him. Many of the martyrs went rejoicing to the
   stake, because an opportunity was given them to demonstrate to the
   world that the love of God is stronger than the love of life. He who
   chooses a religious life because it will add to his reputation among
   men, instead of its being attended with any serious interference with
   his love of ease, and of worldly pleasures, and of worldly popularity,
   is utterly wanting in the very first element of a holy character.
   Unless our first aim is to please God, we need inquire no farther.
   There is a fundamental lack. She who puts on apparel to please men
   rather than God should make no pretensions to sanctity. There can be
   none. To profess it is absurd.

   He who truly loves God will honestly and carefully endeavor to
   ascertain His will.


   "O how I love thy Law! it is my meditation all the day."--Ps. 119:97

   And again,


   "Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
   I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all
   riches. I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
   ways."--Ps. 119:11, 14, 15.

   This is the language of one who loves God. He studies the Bible--not as
   a literary critic, but with a sincere desire to know the will of God
   concerning him. There was never a saint who did not love the word of
   God. The knowledge that a holy person desires above all other, is a
   knowledge of God's will. So he studies the sacred writings--not to
   establish a doctrine or to prove a disputed point; but to really find
   out what God requires of him. He would not pervert it, nor make it bend
   to his convenience or his prejudices. But let one lose the love of God
   out of his heart, and the relish for the Bible is g one. It is
   generally neglected. If read, as it may be when the light becomes
   darkness, it is that its meaning may be perverted so as to form an
   excuse for an unholy life. There are many now, as in the Apostle's day,
   "who handle the word of God deceitfully."

   A holy person has his ear open to the voice of God in the soul. There
   is a still, small voice, that one who loves God does not fail to hear.
   He who formed the ear can speak to the ear. In many things respecting
   which the word of God is silent, or speaks only in general terms, we
   need specific directions by the Holy Spirit.


   "As many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of
   God."--Rom. 8:14

   If we love God, we delight to hear Him speak to us. Even if reproof is
   given, we rejoice to hear it. We are glad to listen even to the
   warnings that our Heavenly Father gives. But his voice of approbation
   compensates a thousand times for any hardships we may have undergone,
   or any sacrifices we may have made. In whatever way God speaks, or
   whatever may be the import of His message, He always finds in those who
   love Him attentive listeners. They are so thankful for the
   condescension showed that they listen with the utmost reverence and
   attention. In their hearts they say, "Speak, Lord, for thy servant
   heareth."

   The truly devout also take delight in ascertaining the will of God as
   shown in the physical laws by which our bodies and other material
   substances are governed. A lover of God is likely to be a lover of
   nature.

   If we love God we have a high relish for that preaching and that
   reading which most plainly discloses, and most strongly enforces the
   will of God. We try those who say they are apostles. It was to embodied
   spirits,--to preachers and teachers of the Gospel--that the Apostle
   refers when he says, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the
   spirits whether they are of God:" for he assigns as a reason,


   "because many false prophets are gone out into the world."--I John 4:1

   We shall hear and support preachers--not because they are talented or
   eloquent--but because they speak the word of God faithfully. This will
   be to us of prime importance. No amount of polished oratory will be
   accepted as a substitute for fidelity to God. A holy person cannot give
   encouragement to compromisers and trimmers. He cannot bid them
   God-speed who bring another Gospel. He does not help false prophets--no
   matter though they may belong to his own denomination--by giving them
   his presence and his money. This, again, will make trouble. But
   holiness, in a sinful world, has always been a troublesome thing. It is
   so because it is holiness.

   Again, if we love God we shall manifest it by unquestioning obedience
   to all His commands. There can be no real love to God without the
   spirit of obedience. Our Saviour makes obedience the test of love.


   "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
   me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love
   him and will manifest myself to him."--John 14:21

   This is clear and conclusive. Professions of love to God, when attended
   by manifest disobedience to His commands, show how easy it is to be
   deceived. Christ cannot be mistaken; but the most intelligent among us
   may be very much out of the way, especially in the opinion which we
   entertain of our own state of grace. We are safe only as we measure
   ourselves by the standard which God gives. And He repeatedly gives
   obedience as the test of love.

   We must have respect to all of His commands. It will not do for us to
   make choice of those which it is fashionable to obey, and disregard
   those that are commonly disregarded. Such a course would prove that we
   are the slaves of fashion, instead of being the servants of God. This
   was what brought upon the Pharisees the severest denunciations the
   Saviour ever uttered.

   Finally, he who loves God has a spirit of devotion. He loves the
   worship of God, secret, social and, public. The saints have always been
   a praying people. They talk a great deal to God. If they cannot use the
   enticing words of man's wisdom, they can plead before the throne with
   "groanings that cannot be uttered," and their prayers avail. They know
   that they have the things they ask for. They love the mercy-seat. Those
   who have been mighty on earth for God, were mighty in prayer. David was
   a valiant warrior; but his fiercest battles were fought out in his
   closet. Elijah, was too strong for his king, had power over the
   elements, and openly conquered death, because he prevailed in prayer.

   Prayer answered turns to praise.--Hence one who loves God delights in
   His praises. With the Psalmist he says,


   "I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in
   my mouth."--Ps. 34:1

   See how full the Psalms are of the praises of God. In the New Testament
   we are commanded to "rejoice in the Lord always." Now if we love God,
   we shall delight to do this. We would as soon think of hiring others to
   eat our necessary food for us, as to hire them to praise God for us
   while our own tongues are silent. A holy people will never employ
   others to worship God for them Never!--Acts of worship performed by the
   ungodly or indifferent, even though they be done decently and in order,
   and paid for by the church, are but open mockery and not worship. Mere
   sound, though it be pleasant to the ear, is not worship.


   "God is a Spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit
   and in truth."--John 4:24
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 13

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--TRUST IN GOD

   True holiness brings man into the most intimate relations with His
   Creator. He is a child of God. Of this he is assured by the direct
   witness of the Spirit. Those terms which express the greatest
   solicitude which one human being can feel in another, are employed to
   represent the care which our Heavenly Father has over those who walk
   before Him in the beauty of holiness. Can any thing exceed the care
   which a father has for a son whom he tenderly loves? How he endeavors
   to give him the education which will best fit him for the duties of
   life! What self-denial does he often practice that this may be
   accomplished! How he watches over his disposition, and labors to
   correct his faults! He watches against such associations as may work to
   his injury! But God says,


   "I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters,
   saith the Lord Almighty."--II Cor. 6:18

   Yet the love of a mother, if not stronger, is more enduring than a
   father's love. It follows her child with ceaseless anxiety to the ends
   of the earth, and to the close of life. It survives the loss of
   character, and the wreck of hope. It goes, with tearful eye and ardent
   sympathy, and trembling step, with the criminal to his cell, and the
   murderer to the gallows. But a mother may forget her child, but God
   will never forget those who separate themselves to His service. They
   are said to be graven upon the palms of His hands to be continually
   before Him.

   A holy person, then, trusts in God. All his interests, for time and
   eternity, are committed to the keeping of Him who never wearies. He has
   confidence in God. A loving child is not always exacting promises--he
   trusts his parents for all his needs. So a holy person trusts in God
   himself. He has confidence in the ability and in the willingness of His
   Heavenly Father to do for him the very best that his circumstances call
   for. He may not always see how it is coming out. He does not ask to. He
   feels the utmost assurance that all things work together for good to
   them that love God. With that he is satisfied.

   He trusts God in particular:

   For all the grace that he needs. He knows that God can carry him
   through. The channel supplied from a mighty river, may be small but it
   is always full. The source of the supply is inexhaustible. So is it
   with the fountain of all goodness. There is grace for us for any
   emergency. We never need be overcome. No matter how sudden may be the
   attack, our Protector is ever at hand. The darts thrown at us may be
   fiery, and hurled with tremendous force, but they can never penetrate
   our shield. The enemies that assail us may be legion, but more are they
   that are for us. Thus a holy person, while not presumptuous, is
   confident in God. He knows in whom he trusts, and that He is able to
   keep, in perfect security, that which He has committed to His care.
   Whatever may be his duties, whatever God may call upon him to do, He
   will give him grace to perform. Increasing loads of care, and labor,
   and responsibility may be laid upon him, but his strength is so
   multiplied that he is able always to testify that Christ's yoke is
   easy, and His burden light. Temptations most furious, most subtle, and
   nicely adapted to accomplish their end may assail him, but he always
   finds that with the temptation, God provides a way of escape, that he
   may be able to bear it. So his confidence in God that He will give him
   increased strength, as his wants require, never fails. He is not
   discouraged, ever ready to give up the battle; but he boldly renews it
   from time to time, and goes in for new conquests, and an extension of
   Christ's kingdom. He knows that the battle is the Lord's, and he never
   expects defeat.

   He trusts God for temporal blessings. If God is the giver of every good
   and perfect gift, we should naturally expect that He would provide for
   His children. So His word declares that He will "withhold no good thing
   from them that walk uprightly." He knows best what is good for us. We
   take the remedies which a doctor in whom we have confidence prescribes,
   without knowing before hand what their effects may be; and shall we not
   as cheerfully accept from our Father's hand whatever temporal
   dispensations He may order? Disappointment may be bitter, but it may be
   just the remedy we need to sharpen the appetite for spiritual food.
   Toils and privations may be grievous to the flesh, but they may be
   necessary to purify our spirits of their grossness and fit them for
   their upward flight. But whatever is best God will give us if we walk
   before Him in the light of holiness. Every holy person has the most
   unbounded confidence in the declaration,


   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these
   things shall be added unto you."--Matt. 6:33

   This does not make him indolent or improvident. Quite the contrary. He
   labors unweariedly because he labors in hope. He is


   "not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord." Rom.
   12:11

   He does the best he can, dismisses all anxiety, and commits all to the
   hands of God, for soul and body, for time and eternity. He who can
   trust God for his happiness in another world, certainly can have no
   hesitation in trusting Him to have his necessary wants supplied for the
   few fleeting years of his probationary existence. If God cares for the
   oxen, and cares for the grass of the field, He will care for His
   children. Their wants will be provided for if they do their duty. He
   can send manna in the desert, and bring water from the flinty rock. So
   a holy person rests in the promise, "Your bread shall be given you, and
   your water shall be sure." His Protector is always at hand: his
   Provider is always near. The Lord is his refuge: the Most High is his
   habitation.


   "They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be
   removed, but abideth forever."--Ps. 125:1
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 14

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--LOVE TO MAN

   We have seen that there can be no true holiness without the love of
   God. Neither can there be without love for our fellow men. The two are
   joined together. The second great commandment is,


   "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."--Matt. 22:39

   Our Saviour, in the account which he gives of the good Samaritan, (Luke
   10:30), teaches us that our neighbor is any one, even though belonging
   to an unfriendly nation, who stands in need of our sympathy and
   assistance. A holy person feels a lively interest in the well-being of
   his fellow men. His heart is large--it takes in mankind. His arms are
   long--they carry assistance to the perishing in the ends of the earth.
   He enters into the spirit of the great commission,


   "Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every
   creature."--Mark 16:15

   His law knows no boundary lines. His efforts to do good are not
   confined to any territorial limits. His righteousness goeth forth


   "as a lamp that burneth."--Isa. 62:1

   In addition to active good-will towards all mankind, holiness implies a
   special love for our brethren, the children of God. The New Testament
   is very explicit on this point.


   "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a, liar: for
   he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God
   whom he hath not seen?"--I John 4:20

   Comment can make these words no plainer.


   "We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the
   brethren."--I John 3:14

   This love is not bare sentiment. It is an ardent affection. It makes us
   care for each other's interest and welfare. We take pleasure in each
   other's company,


   "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together; . . . but
   exhorting one another daily."--Heb. 10:25

   If one member suffer, all the members suffer with it. If one soul is in
   destitution, those who have, are ready to supply his necessities.


   "Whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and
   shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of
   God in him?"--I John 3:17

   If one is in peril, others share his danger. This is the spirit of true
   holiness. It was exemplified fully in the primitive Christians. Paul
   says:


   "After ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
   partly while ye were made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and
   afflictions; and partly while ye became companions of them that were so
   used. For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
   spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a
   better and an enduring substance."--Heb. 10:32-34.

   Lucian, a Roman writer, says of the early Christians: "It is incredible
   what expedition they use when any of their friends are known to be in
   trouble. In a word, they spare nothing on such an occasion,--for those
   miserable men have no doubt they shall be immortal and live forever;
   therefore they contemn death and many surrender themselves to
   sufferings. Moreover, their first lawgiver has taught them they are all
   brethren, when once they have turned, and renounced the gods of the
   Greeks, and worship this Master of theirs who was crucified, and engage
   to live according to His laws. They have also a sovereign contempt for
   all the things of this world, and look upon them as common." This is
   the testimony borne by an enemy.

   A holy person does not love indiscriminately and blindly those who
   profess to be Christians, simply because they belong to the same church
   that he does. This displays a partisan spirit. He tries those who say
   they are apostles. His love is not the result of any reasonings; nor is
   it based on natural qualities nor acquired gifts. It springs from the
   love of Christ. We love Him so greatly that we instinctively love His
   true friends. Those who walk in the light have fellowship for each
   other. They find each other out, and their hearts naturally run
   together. Rays of light, coming from the same source, easily mingle.
   Living streams, however widely separated, unite at last in the ocean.
   Holy persons feel that union of spirit, which is properly called, the
   communion of saints.

   Holiness implies love for our enemies. It is impossible to have true
   holiness without having enemies. Christ had them. He told His disciples
   they should have them.


   "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye
   are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore
   the world hateth you."--John 15:19

   If you belong to Christ, His enemies will be your enemies. They will
   hate you. Their hostility will sometimes assume an active form. They
   will go just as far as the law will allow them to go in manifesting
   this hostility. They will traduce you, misrepresent your actions, and
   impugn your motives. But what must you do? Stand still and see the
   salvation of God. You must feel the compassion for them that you would
   for an insane person. Neglect no opportunity to do them good. Never get
   tried with them, nor attempt to repay them evil for evil. Our Saviour's
   command is very plain:


   "Love your enemies. Bless them that curse you; do good to them that
   hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute
   you."--Matt. 5:44

   This is Bible holiness. No other religion but that of Jesus will enable
   a person to do this. There may be the semblance. Anger may be
   suppressed by force of resolution. But God alone is able to make us
   really love our enemies, and honestly strive to promote their welfare.
   The Holy Spirit will enable us to hate sin, and love the sinner. It
   will make us kind to them, but not indulgent to their faults. Holiness
   is not blind. It has eyes as well as heart. It never mistakes darkness
   for light. To one who has true holiness it is not hard to obey the
   command,


   "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in
   so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."--Rom. 12:20

CHAPTER 15

  ATTRIBUTES OF HOLINESS--JOY

   Joy forms an essential element of true holiness. As caloric pervades
   matter, so joy is interfused through every sanctified soul. It may be
   developed more on some occasions than on others but it is always there.
   Not that a saint of God is exempt from sorrows, but in the midst of
   sufferings he can say with the Apostle,


   "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing."--II Cor. 6:10.

   Vessels floating on a river are driven up stream by the wind, but
   underneath, the current flows steadily on to the ocean. So the sad
   occurrences of life occasion grief to the saint, while down deep in the
   heart joy reigns undisturbed. This joy is not of earthly origin. It
   does not stand connected with temporal prosperity. Prosperity does not
   create it; adversity does not destroy it. The good opinion of our
   fellow-men does not set it in motion, nor their persecutions stop its
   steady flow. It does not spring from the consciousness of the
   possession of any gifts, natural or gracious. It is supernatural in its
   origin; pure and holy in its nature. It comes from God as directly as
   pardon comes from God. It is imparted to the soul by the direct power
   of the Spirit. Hence it is called the joy of the Holy Ghost. That is,
   the joy which the Holy Ghost imparts. It is a God-given
   happiness--happiness intensified. It is not levity. It is a solid joy.

   There is a strong tendency to undervalue this joy. It is spoken of
   frequently by professed Christians in a contemptuous manner, as
   emotional, affecting only weak-minded persons, and short-lived in its
   continuance. That it is emotional, we admit. So is the compassion which
   leads us to relieve the suffering, without which, we are as


   "sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal."--I Cor. 13:1.

   And whoever reads his Bible will find that some very strong-minded
   persons have been affected with joy to an overpowering degree. David
   was a mighty man. But so great was his gladness when the ark of the
   Lord was brought up into his city, that "he danced before the Lord with
   all his might." When his proud wife "saw King David leaping and dancing
   before the Lord, she despised him in her heart." (II Sam. 6:14, 16.)
   But God cursed her and blessed the king. As to its duration, holy joy
   is to last forever.


   "And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs
   and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and
   gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away."--Isa. 35:10.

   That this joy is an essential element of true holiness, we prove from
   the Scriptures.


   "Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full
   of joy with thy countenance."--Acts 2:28

   The way of life is a saving knowledge of God. A look of approbation
   from Him fills the soul with joy.


   "I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no
   man taketh from you."--John 16:22.

   The disciples were sad at the prospect that Jesus was about to leave
   them. He consoled them with the promise that He would manifest Himself
   to them spiritually--would be with them always, and this would afford
   them a joy that no man could deprive them of. This joy is just as free
   for the disciples of Jesus now as it was then. More than this, it is
   positively promised.


   "He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
   me; and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love
   him, and will manifest myself to him."--John 14:21

   Every holy soul obeys Christ, and so Christ gives him a joy that man
   cannot take from him.


   "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and
   peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."--Rom. 14:17

   Here holiness is said to consist of three elements. We have just as
   much right to conclude that we have it when we are destitute of the
   righteousness as we have, when destitute of the joy. God has joined the
   three together. Let no man put them asunder.


   "And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost."--Acts
   13:52

   This, too, was in the midst of a violent persecution.


   "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
   gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.--Gal. 5:22.

   No one can have true holiness without having the Spirit of God. But
   wherever the Spirit of God is, it will bring forth its appropriate
   fruits,--not one, but all,--not in some favorite localities,
   merely,--but in all places--not occasionally, but constantly. Joy is
   just as really one of the fruits of the Spirit as love or peace.
   Whoever has the Spirit of God has joy.


   "In whom though now ye see him not, yet believing ye rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory."--I Peter 1:8

   Whoever enjoys true holiness is a believer in Jesus. But all believers
   have joy unspeakable and full of glory.

   How explicit are the Scriptures on this point. They show plainly that
   wherever holiness is, there is joy. We might go on at an indefinite
   length, for the Scriptures are as full, as they are plain; but if these
   passages which we have quoted do not carry conviction, no amount of
   proof will avail. The difficulty is beyond the reach of argument--it
   lies in the heart and not in the intellect.

   But we are not alone in our opinion of the teaching of the Bible in
   this matter. John Wesley says, "True religion, or a heart right towards
   God and man, implies happiness as well as holiness. It is not only
   righteousness, but also peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. Joy wrought in
   the heart by the Holy Ghost, by the ever blessed Spirit of God. This
   peace, joy, love--this change from glory to glory is what the wisdom of
   the world has voted to be madness, mere enthusiasm, utter distraction.
   But thou, O man of God, regard them not; be thou moved by none of those
   things. See that no man take thy crown.

   "Joy in the Holy Ghost will far more effectually purify the soul, than
   the want of that joy; and the peace of God is the best means of
   refining the soul from the dross of earthly affections. Without doubt
   our joy in the Lord will increase as our love increases."

   President Edwards was a rigid Calvinist--a man of gigantic intellect,
   great learning and solid piety. He says, "The Scriptures speak of holy
   joy, as a great part of true religion. So it is represented.

   "And as an important part of religion, exhorted to and pressed with
   great earnestness.


   Delight thyself in the Lord, and he shall give thee the desires of
   thine heart.'--Ps. 37:4 Rejoice in the Lord ye righteous.'--Ps. 97:12.
   So, Rejoice in the Lord, O, ye righteous.'--Ps. 33:1 Rejoice and be
   exceeding glad.'--Matt. 5:12. Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the
   Lord.'--Phil. 3:1 Rejoice in the Lord alway; and again I say,
   Rejoice.'--Phil. 4:4. Rejoice evermore.'--I Thess. 5:16 Let Israel
   rejoice in him that made him; let the children of Zion be joyful in the
   King.'--Ps. 149:2

   This is mentioned among the principal fruits of the Spirit of grace.
   (Gal. 5:22.) The Psalmist mentions his holy joy as an evidence of his
   sincerity.


   I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as much as in all
   riches.'--Ps. 119:14.

   "He who has no religious affection, is in a state of spiritual death,
   and is wholly destitute of the powerful, quickening, saving influences
   of the Spirit of God upon his heart."

   The hymns that are sung by all denominations present precisely the view
   of joy as forming an essential element of true holiness which we have
   here set forth. In many a church they sing with Watts,


   "The men of grace have found, Glory begun below."

   If glory is not begun in your heart, there is a serious lack in your
   experience. In like manner, we sing with Charles Wesley,


   "How happy every child of grace, Who knows his sins forgiven."

   But similar sentiments are found in every orthodox hymn book. If they
   are not true, why sing them? Is it right to sing lies? If they are
   true, why settle down in your religious experience without this joy, as
   though an essential element of holiness were of no consequence? Many
   not only do this, but even oppose and persecute those who are enabled,
   through grace, to


   "rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory."--I Peter 1:8

   Others who do not go so far, treat these rejoicing ones in a
   patronizing kind of way, as though they were to be tolerated and
   pitied. True holiness of itself will make its possessor happy and
   triumphant. His springs are in God, and they never run dry. He does not
   go to the world for pleasures, but is


   "abundantly satisfied with the fatness" of God's house, and drinks "of
   the rivers of his pleasure."--Ps. 36:8
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 16

  EXAMPLES OF HOLINESS

   It is easier to follow than to lead. Ordinary navigators can cross the
   ocean after Columbus has led the way. A few lessons from Morse enables
   one with common aptness to send a message a thousand miles in an
   instant of time. We do not wait, before we embark in any business
   enterprise which we think will be greatly to our advantage, until
   everybody else has gone into it; but if it commends itself to our
   judgment, and a single individual, with no advantages superior to our
   own, has achieved a marked success, we press boldly forward.

   Why should we not do so in religious experience? Why run a greater
   hazard for the gold that perisheth than for the gold tried in the fire?
   Why press on with the multitude in the broad way, strewed with wrecks
   of early hopes, and which ends in darkness and destruction? Why neglect
   the narrow way, which a few have demonstrated is not only feasible, but
   increasingly delightful, until it takes us where there are pleasures
   for evermore?

   In all ages, there have been those who have experienced the blessing of
   holiness in their hearts and exemplified it in their lives. They have
   not been the honored of earth. Generally they were persecuted and
   despised while living. Their true characters were understood and
   appreciated by but few. But they have left an example which will shine
   with increasing luster to the latest generations.

   ABEL leads the van of the blood-washed army. We know but little about
   him. But this we are told, that he did not rely upon his natural
   goodness, but came to God through faith in the atoning blood. He
   brought of the firstlings of his flock. His offering spoke of his sense
   of sinfulness, of his penitence, and of his acceptance of the great
   truth that "without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins."
   He found favor and acceptance with God, and died the death of a martyr.


   "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
   by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of
   his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh."--Heb, 11:4.

   ENOCH. He was the seventh from Adam. In what respect those times were
   more favorable for living a godly life than the present, we are at a
   loss to imagine. If the world had not had as long an experience in
   wickedness, neither had it in goodness. There was no written revelation
   of God's will.--The countless examples which we have of the ruinous
   effects of sin, and of the advantages of holiness, were then wanting.
   Wicked men must have had even a greater skill in leading the good
   astray than they have now, for they lived much longer. That wickedness
   abounded is beyond dispute, for Enoch died only about eighty years
   before Noah was born. We read that in the days of Noah,


   "All flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth."--Gen. 6:12.

   But general corruption comes on gradually. There must have been, then,
   great wickedness in the days of Enoch. But in the midst of it,


   "Enoch walked with God."--Gen. 5:22.

   In this simple statement is a world of meaning. It is testimony that
   cannot be questioned, to his complete deliverance from every sin, and
   to his enjoyment of every grace which is necessary to constitute a holy
   character. And his daily course of life was steady and uniform. He was
   not at one time governed by high religious principle, and at another
   led by Folly in her train. He exemplified holiness in all the relations
   of life. He was acquainted with all the cares and trials that press
   upon the head of a family, but his patience, his faith, his courage
   never gave out. As years passed over him he did not compromise as so
   many do, but he held out true to God to the end. He did not hold his
   peace in the presence of sin; but bore an outspoken testimony against
   the increasing ungodliness around. Enoch prophesied, saying,


   "Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints, to execute
   judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of
   all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all
   their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against
   him."--Jude 14, 15.

   This remarkable passage shows both the wickedness of the times, and the
   fidelity of Enoch in giving a faithful warning. It also shows that the
   immortality of the soul was a doctrine well understood in those days.
   The language plainly implies that the saints spoken of were with God,
   for they were to come with Him--He was not to go to them first and
   raise them from the grave.

   During three hundred years--a period three times that of our national
   existence--this holy man "walked with God." So complete was his
   deliverance from sin, that even his body formed an exception and did
   not return to the dust. In Genesis it is said,


   "He was not; for God took him."--Gen. 5:24.

   St. Paul explains this as follows: "By faith Enoch was translated that
   he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated
   him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased
   God."

   NOAH. God does not leave Himself without a witness. When all flesh had
   corrupted his way upon the earth, and the earth was filled with
   violence, Noah remained true to God. He stood alone. Wickedness was
   general. It was also most intense. Men lived long, and became
   proficient in crime.


   "And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
   that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually."--Gen. 6:5

   It is impossible to describe sin as more intense or more deeply seated.
   In the midst of this moral corruption Noah lived a holy life for six
   hundred years. He had all the elements of true holiness.

   There was a strong power of resistance. There is never an Eden on earth
   into which the tempter does not enter. You cannot build walls so high
   that they will keep out the emissaries of evil. Every apostle of truth
   will find it to his apparent advantage to sell out his Master. He who
   is willing to follow in the evil paths will never be at a loss for some
   to lead the way. In the most favored localities bad examples can be
   found. He who takes the broad road that leadeth to destruction, will
   never lack for companions.

   Noah's friends and neighbors, relatives and acquaintances, all forsook
   the service of God. In most places, here and there one can be found who
   has the fear of God before him. But it was not so in that age of the
   world. Go as far as he might, in whatever direction he might, he could
   find no assembly of the saints--for there were no saints to assemble.
   Every gathering was a wicked gathering. Every man was a wicked man. To
   stem this current of corruption required moral energy. He had it. We
   may have it. The force of gravity is just as great now as it was when
   the world was first swung out upon its orbit. So grace does not
   degenerate. It can do for us all it did for the patriarchs of the
   infant world.

   Noah was a just man. He met all his obligations, both to God and his
   fellow man. Some men who call themselves honest will, when opportunity
   offers, take advantage of those who have taken advantage of them. They
   try to be even with the dishonest. If the government steals from them
   they do not hesitate to defraud the government. If they suspect others
   of misrepresenting, their own representations must be taken with
   allowance. But Noah was just. Honesty is essential to holiness. It is
   but a small part of holiness, but it is a necessary part. No excess in
   other directions can compensate for a lack here.

   He was a devout man. While walking uprightly among his fellow men he
   maintained a spirit of true devotion to God. In every thing he was led
   by the Spirit. His life was one of communion with God. His prayers and
   praises were not formal. He walked with God.

   Without a spirit of devotion the most rigid morality makes one but a
   Stoic. He is not a Christian. An essential ingredient is wanting.
   Without the love of God there can be no true service of God. But if we
   love God we shall walk with him. We shall have a consciousness of his
   presence. He will talk with us and we shall talk with Him.

   He was consistent. His piety was all of a pattern. There was no
   redundancy and no lack. Some who are very devout abroad, are
   ill-tempered at home. Some will give liberally, but they make their
   money by questionable practices. Others are full of integrity, kind,
   polite, firm, but they encourage pride, both by silence and by example.
   Many hold out well for a time, and then gradually cool down to the
   temperature around them. But Noah was perfect in his generations. (Gen.
   6:9.) He began well and he held out as he began.

   In true holiness there is symmetry of character. Every one has his
   natural defects, but grace is intended to supply these defects.
   Whatever is too prominent it depresses; whatever is wrong it removes,
   and it furnishes whatever is lacking. Any one may become a saint.
   Whatever is needful for the purpose God can, by the mighty operation of
   His Spirit, impart. The Bible not only affirms that Noah was perfect,
   but the Saviour commands us to be perfect. "Be ye therefore perfect,
   even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect."--Matt. 5:48. This
   has respect, not to any one good quality in particular, but to all good
   qualities. It is the practical application, made by the Saviour, of His
   own blessed teachings. It requires right feelings towards our
   fellow-men, and a course of conduct corresponding in every particular
   to that feeling. It enjoins love to our enemies, the kind treatment of
   all, and the full discharge of all the obligations which we owe to our
   Heavenly Father.

   The end aimed at in all the teachings of the Bible, is this
   completeness of Christian character.


   "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
   unto all good works."--II Tim. 3:16, 17.

   St. Paul also tells us that it was to secure this perfection of
   Christian graces that the ministry was given.


   "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists;
   and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for
   the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till
   we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son
   of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the
   fulness of Christ."--Eph. 4:11-13.

   With all these helps, it is expected that the weakest Christian excel
   the mightiest saint who lived and died without these aids.


   "Verily I say unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath
   not risen a greater than John the Baptist; notwithstanding, he that is
   least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he." Matt. 11:11

   Does not the prophet refer to this when he says,


   "He that is feeble among them at that day shall be is David."--Zech.
   12:8

   JOB. The place which the book of Job occupies in the Bible is
   calculated [liable] to leave a wrong impression as to the time when he
   lived. We naturally suppose that the Books which are placed first were
   written first. But this is not always the case. Dr. George Smith in his
   "Patriarchal Age," shows conclusively that Job was born about two
   hundred and eighty years after the death of Noah. He lived in Arabia
   when Babylon and Assyria were in their infancy. The book of Job,
   probably written by Job himself is without doubt the oldest book in
   existence. As a literary production it challenges our highest
   admiration. Its poetry is in the most exalted strain, and its allusions
   to natural science have stood the test of the criticism of ages.

   As to the character of Job God himself bears the clearest testimony. He
   calls him his servant and says,


   "There is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
   that feareth God, and escheweth evil."--Job 1:8

   He manifested his piety under a great variety of circumstances, and
   with the most satisfactory results.

   He is mentioned in the Bible as one of the three holy men who had the
   greatest power with God.


   "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should
   deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord
   God."--Ezek. 14:14.

   Let us look, first, at some of the elements of the character of this
   man who stood thus high in the favor of God.

   He was a perfect man. The word "perfect"as used in the Bible in this,
   and in similar connections, is a qualifying term, not so much of
   degree, as of kind. It signifies "whole," "complete," with nothing
   lacking. It implies not an excess of one moral quality, and a
   corresponding lack in others, but the harmonious blending of all moral
   virtues in their proper proportions. There are, and always have been,
   but few such saints in the world. With the most, there is a want of
   symmetry. Their lives present the appearance of a mountainous
   country--sometimes up, sometimes down. Their graces are out of
   proportion. But Job's character was duly balanced. This is not only
   implied in the term "perfect," but it also appears from the other
   qualities ascribed to him.

   He was an upright man. This is the character that man possessed before
   the fall. God made man upright. Job had regained this original
   character. He was governed in all the relations of life by the
   principles of sterling integrity. No opportunity to promote his
   personal interests could cause him to swerve from the right, in the
   slightest degree. The holiness that does not make men honest, is
   hypocrisy and not holiness.

   Uprightness is that disposition which leads one to give to all that
   which is their due. A man who binds himself by oaths and obligations to
   screen from justice those with whom he is associated, cannot possibly
   be an upright man. The heavy oaths that are upon him make him lean from
   the right. As long as he acknowledges the binding force of these
   obligations, it is impossible for him to be an upright man. They are
   intended to make him lean. Unless this object is secured they are an
   utter failure. But Job was free to deal justly with all men. He gave no
   preferences to one above another on account of any associations or
   connections.

   He feared God. He was not a cold, heathen moralist. He had a deep,
   abiding reverence for His Creator. The fear of incurring the
   displeasure of God was a controlling element in his nature.


   "My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
   Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have
   esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. But he is
   in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even
   that he doeth. For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me;
   and many such things are with him. Therefore am I troubled at his
   presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him."--Job 23:11-15

   There can be no true holiness without the fear of God. The piety that
   leaves this out, is weak and enervated, and always gives way under
   pressure of temptation. It is earthly in its origin, earthly in its
   motives, policy and tendency.

   He avoided sin. This follows as a natural consequence of fearing God.
   "The fear of the Lord is to depart from evil." That is--it leads men to
   depart from all moral evil; or sin. Where wickedness openly and
   generally prevails, it will be found that the fear of God has been
   thrown off. In revivals, where the converts remain proud and dressy as
   before, and hold on to all their worldly associations, it will be found
   that the preaching is of that nature that is not calculated to produce
   much of the fear of God. Knowing the terrors of the Lord we persuade
   men. The old revivalists, such as Wesley, Edwards, Knapp and Redfield,
   whose converts generally held out in the narrow way, were men who
   proclaimed the law of God in thunder tones, and laid the foundation for
   a genuine Christian experience and a consistent Christian life, by
   begetting in the minds of their hearers a salutary fear of God.

   Job exemplified the principles of holiness in all the relations of
   life, and under the most trying circumstances.

   As a father, how careful he was of the spiritual welfare of his
   children!


   "And it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about, that
   Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and
   offered burnt-offering according to the number of them all: for Job
   said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their
   hearts. Thus did Job continually."--Job 1:5.

   As a ruler--for Job as a patriarch was a ruler among his people,--he
   was just and merciful. Such was his uprightness as a judge that he was
   treated with the greatest respect by all. "When I went out to the gate
   through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!"--where to
   this day in oriental cities judges hold their courts,--


   "The young men saw me and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood
   up. The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
   The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of
   their mouth. When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the
   eye saw me, it gave witness to me: because I delivered the poor that
   cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. The
   blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the
   widow's heart to sing for joy. I put on righteousness, and it clothed
   me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. I was eyes to the blind,
   and feet was I to the lame. I was a father to the poor: and the cause
   which I knew not I searched out. And I brake the jaws of the wicked,
   and plucked the spoil out of his teeth."--Job. 29:7-17.

   Would that all our magistrates were men of this character. Thus did Job
   exemplify holiness in prosperity.

   But reverses came upon him. His children were cut down suddenly by the
   whirlwind's stroke. His property was swept away; a foul disease preyed
   upon his body; his friends decided against him--as friends are very apt
   to do when we need them most; and even the wife of his bosom turned
   against him, and reproachingly said,


   "Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die."--Job 2:9.

   Yet under this accumulation of trials, Job's faith in God never for an
   instant gave way. He maintained his fidelity to God to the last.

   True holiness is adapted to us equally in all the relations and in all
   the circumstances of life. It is a crown of beauty to the young, an
   unfailing source of strength to the middle-aged, an unwavering support
   to the aged, and to all a safe covering from the scorching rays of
   prosperity and the blasting storms of adversity. Follow holiness
   without which no man shall see the Lord.

CHAPTER 17

  LIMITS OF SANCTIFICATION

   Holiness is popular. There is great danger of its being carried too
   far. Already the effort is being made to sanctify things that cannot be
   sanctified.

   There is a limit to the subjects of sanctification. There are some
   things which, from their nature, are not capable of being made holy.
   The best mathematician cannot teach an ox the multiplication table, or
   teach a horse algebra. A church raised up in the providence of God to
   spread Scriptural holiness through the land, cannot make gambling holy,
   or sanctify pride. The things which God forbids, should be put away and
   not reformed. All attempts at reforming things forbidden by the word of
   God, should be abandoned. God lays the axe at the root of the tree. Let
   us ply our blows there, and though the tree may seem as flourishing as
   ever, yet work on and it will fall when the roots are severed. You may
   trim at the branches and show results in the handful of severed twigs
   you bear off in triumph, but the tree will only be the more vigorous
   from the pruning.

   Money-worship cannot be sanctified. In the eyes of the world men are
   estimated less by their worth than by their wealth. The ability to gain
   and hold wealth is treated as a cardinal virtue. Bad, incompetent men
   are elected and appointed to high official positions, for no other
   reason than because they are rich. This mammon worship is wrong. It is
   idolatry. It is degrading to manhood and insulting to God. It is wholly
   bad--bad in itself. It cannot be sanctified by taking it into the house
   of God and making it contribute to the support of the Gospel. It is as
   wrong to give a man a seat in the house of God because he is rich, as
   it is to give him a seat in Congress, or in the Cabinet, for the same
   reason. It is as wicked to trade in pews as it is to trade in votes. It
   is just as corrupt to buy one's way to a front seat in a church, as it
   is to buy a seat in the Legislature. The principle that lies at the
   bottom is, a servile acknowledgment of the Almighty Dollar. It is
   giving money preference over the man. It is placing a lower estimate
   upon Christian virtues than upon money. It paying the homage to gold
   that is due only to merit. This principle cannot be sanctified. It
   should be put away from the house of God entirely. Men should stand
   there, as men. There should no preference be given to one over another
   on account of wealth. The rich and he poor should meet together,
   feeling that the Lord is the Maker of us all.

   Pride cannot be sanctified. It may be introduced into holy places, but
   such an introduction does not make it holy. A jewel may be inserted in
   the flesh--heathens hang them in the nose--Christians in the ears--but
   it does not become flesh. It may produce inflammation, but it cannot
   add to the strength. Pride may enter largely into the construction and
   furnishing of edifices consecrated to sacred uses, but this does not
   render the pride sacred. God speaks of those who anciently introduced
   unauthorized refinements into His worship, as


   "A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that
   sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of
   brick."--Isa. 65:3.

   To display pride and fashion-badges of the love of the world in the
   church, is as if the wife should present herself to her husband adorned
   with the rings and jewels of his wicked rival and enemy.


   "Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the
   world is enmity with God? Whosoever, therefore, will be a friend of the
   world is the enemy of God."--Jas. 4:4.

   The attempt to sanctify the drama, by making Sabbath school children
   actors; the church the theater, and preachers and leaders the managers,
   can only result in dragging the actors down, instead of elevating the
   stage. Priests and monks tried the same experiment hundreds of years
   ago, taking their characters from the Bible, and their spirit from the
   world, until they made Christianity contemptible, by sinking its
   votaries to the level of the heathen, in morality.

   The effort to sanctify things which should have been put away, has been
   a prolific cause of the corruption of the church in all ages. After the
   conversion of Constantine, the Bishops in their zeal for the conversion
   of the heathen, adopted the heathen rites and called them by Christian
   names; just as the Churches now, to draw in the world, adopt worldly
   pleasures and attempt to throw over them a religious garb. Mosheim
   says, "The rites and institutions, by which the Greeks, Romans, and
   other nations, had formerly testified their religious veneration for
   fictitious deities, were now adopted, with some slight alterations, by
   Christian bishops, and employed in the service of the true God. These
   fervent heralds of the Gospel, whose zeal outran their candor and
   integrity, imagined that the nations would receive Christianity with
   more facility, when they saw the rites and ceremonies to which they
   were accustomed, adopted in the church, and the same worship paid to
   Christ and His martyrs, which they had formerly offered to their idol
   deities. Hence it happened, that, in these times, the religion of the
   Greeks and Romans differed very little, in its external appearance,
   from that of the Christians. They had both a most pompous and splendid
   ritual. Gorgeous robes, miters, tiaras, wax-tapers, crosiers,
   processions, lustrations, images, gold and silver vases, and many such
   circumstances of pageantry, were equally to be seen in the heathen
   temples and in the Christian churches."

   From the fiercest persecutions the church of Jesus Christ rapidly
   recovered and came out purer and stronger from the fiery ordeal. But
   from the attempt to sanctify heathen rites and heathen temples the
   church has never recovered. The most numerous and the most powerful of
   all the churches that bear the Christian name, the Roman Catholic, has
   today more of the spirit and practice of the old pagan churches than of
   the church founded by Jesus Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 18

  A PRESENT EXPERIENCE

   The salvation of the Gospel is present as well as prospective. To one
   who had always lived under ground, and never seen the sun, the promise
   of enjoying the sunshine in years to come would have but little
   meaning. His only idea of the splendor of the sun would be such as he
   could gather from multiplying the rays of his mining lamps. But we, who
   live above-ground, and enjoy the light and heat of the sun, expect to
   see it tomorrow, because we see it today. So we expect to be saved
   eternally, because we are saved in time. "Behold now is the day of
   salvation." It was a devout Calvinist who wrote, "The grace that saves
   the soul from hell, Will save from present sin."

   The idea runs all through the Gospel that salvation is a present
   reality. It is something that is experienced and enjoyed from day to
   day. Jesus says, "Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken
   unto you." He does not say, "shall be," as though the day of
   deliverance was in the future. And Paul writes, "By grace are ye saved,
   through faith." Thus the salvation provided in Christ is every where
   spoken of as something which has a positive existence in the heart of
   every believer.

   It is a great mistake, which many professing Christians make, that of
   throwing their salvation into the future. Ask them, if they are saved,
   and the answer is, "I hope I shall be." What is the ground of this
   hope? The assent of the mind to the truth, and perhaps membership in an
   orthodox Church. But "the devils believe and tremble." Yet they are
   devils still. It is a great blessing to be able to see the truth, and
   to have the courage to stand by it. But unless you go farther than to
   join the church even, and attend its ordinances, you can never be
   saved. Judas went to perdition from the bosom of the Master and the
   company of the Apostles. The road to hell is just as direct from the
   Church as it is from the world. What you need, in order that you may be
   saved in Heaven at last, is, to be saved--now,--from the guilt and from
   the power of sin, and to keep saved unto the end.

   If you are in a state of salvation, you know it. You cannot have
   victory over impatience, over the world, over the trials of daily life,
   and be ignorant of the fact. If your appetites master your reason, and
   your conscience, you can but be aware, to some extent at least, that
   you are under bondage. So, when deliverance comes, you can but realize
   the greatness of the change. If, instead of a spirit of murmuring and
   fretfulness, the peace of God that passeth all understanding reigns in
   your heart, you must be conscious of it yourself, and it must be
   obvious to all around you. Then do not yield to the delusion, that, if
   you believe you are saved you will be saved. Take up with nothing short
   of present deliverance from pride and impatience, and all sinful
   inclinations and sinful desires. Recall the convictions you have had in
   other days. God has not changed. The self-denials, the separation from
   the world that He then required, He still requires. The cross that
   stood in your way then, stands in your way now. You have not gone
   around it. You have gone back. Yom must take it up before you can make
   any further progress. You do not feel as much disturbed now, as you did
   then, because your conscience is becoming seared. The peace which you
   profess. to feel is delusive. It is insensibility, and not peace. You
   are in danger of becoming "past feeling." Welcome conviction. Take up
   the cross that lies before you. If it is laying aside ornamental
   attire, let it go at once. You can carry no garment beyond the grave,
   but the robe washed white in Jesus' blood. If you have taken a wrong
   position, in regard to the work of God, denouncing as fanaticism the
   operations of the Spirit, hesitate not to confess it. If you have
   wronged others, make all the confession and the restitution that the
   circumstances demand. Not only your usefulness, but your soul is at
   stake.


   "If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one
   with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
   all sin."--I John 1:7.

   Resolve to be right.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 19

  HOW OBTAINED

   We use the word sanctified in this chapter, in its fullest sense, as
   equivalent to sanctified wholly.

   Determination is the first great essential to being sanctified to God.
   No matter how deeply one's feelings may be wrought upon, he will not go
   through, unless he is fully decided to be holy, and to lead a holy
   life.

   This decision must be an independent one. It will not do to have any
   secret reservation. Many profess holiness as long as they have a
   preacher that preaches holiness. Then, if they get another pastor, who
   preaches publicly in a Christian pulpit, but worships secretly at the
   altars of Baal, or the shrine of fashion, they will follow their
   preacher wherever he leads. No one, while thus undecided, can ever
   obtain true holiness. There must be the decision of Joshua.


   "But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."--Josh. 24:15

   Others may make an opposite choice; I may grieve over the wrong choice
   they make, but I will not be governed by it. If the multitude goes
   right, I will rejoice in it; but if they go wrong, I will not go with
   them. It is not in battalions that we march up the path of life: it is
   in single file that we press along the narrow way. It is for want of
   this independent determination that so many who profess holiness do not
   hold out. They lean on others, and when their earthly supports give way
   they fall back into the crowded ranks of worldlings in a semi-Christian
   guise.

   This decision must be self-sacrificing. He who will be holy while it is
   popular, or profitable, will never become holy at all. The very essence
   of holiness is the extinction of selfishness. It requires just as much
   of the martyr spirit to be a holy man or woman today, as it did in the
   days when they exposed holy men and women to be torn in pieces by wild
   beasts, or chained them to the stake to be burned. The spirit of
   persecution is not dead. The old antagonism between sin and holiness
   still remains. Christ and Belial sustain no more friendly relations to
   each other than they did in the days of the apostle. It is still true
   that


   "Whosoever will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God." Jas.
   4:4.

   There must be a willingness to encounter its hostility, to endure the
   worst that it can inflict upon us. In the 14th chapter of St. Luke are
   recorded several illustrations which our Lord uses to show the
   necessity of counting the cost, by all who would be His disciples. "So
   likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath,
   he cannot be my disciple."

   If, then, you would obtain true holiness, you must count it of more
   value, not only than any one thing; but more than all things else.
   Things that were the greatest sources of joy to you must be abandoned
   if they stand in the way of living a holy life.

   To obtain holiness we must sanctify ourselves. This is the Lord's order
   as laid down in both the Old and the New Testament. He who prays for a
   harvest, must, if he would not mock God, prepare his ground, and sow,
   and till, and guard against destructive forces, in a proper manner. So
   he who would be holy, must break up the fallow ground of his heart, and
   sow to himself in righteousness. To secure spiritual results, it is
   just as necessary to meet the conditions which God has established, as
   it is to meet physical conditions to secure desired material results.
   The laws of the spiritual kingdom are as inflexible as those of the
   vegetable kingdom. No amount of faith, or of praying, can take the
   place of the work which God requires us to do. We must show our faith
   by our works.

   See how explicit are the directions which God gives to those who would
   be holy.


   "For I am the Lord your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves,
   and ye shall be holy."--Lev. 11:44. "Sanctify yourselves, therefore,
   and be ye holy: for I am the Lord your God."--Lev. 20:7. "And let the
   priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify themselves, lest
   the Lord break forth upon them."--Ex. 19:52.

   These passages teach that we must separate ourselves from every thing
   that is impure; and set ourselves apart for holy purposes, and God will
   make us holy. But our part of the work must be done first. All that is
   necessary for God to do to enable us to do our part, he does in
   advance. God works in us to will and to do, but he can go no farther
   towards making us saints, unless we work out our own salvation as He
   works within us, by His blessed Spirit. We are to go to the extent of
   our ability before we have any right to expect supernatural aid.
   Holiness is a voluntary state. A man is not a machine. His freedom of
   will alone renders him capable of holiness. The New Testament teaching
   is to the same effect.


   "Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse
   ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting
   holiness in the fear of God."--II Cor. 7:1.

   Here is taught the second blessing. They are "dearly beloved;" that is,
   real Christians. They already were holy in part. "Perfecting holiness"
   implies that the work of holiness was already begun in them. Especially
   notice the part enjoined upon us in this passage. We are to "cleanse
   ourselves." We must not ask the Lord to do what we can do. If tobacco
   is not a "filthiness of the flesh" we are at a loss to know what can
   possibly come under that head. If you use it, you can throw it away;
   you can wash your mouth; then you are prepared to pray in faith for God
   to deliver you from the appetite. He has done it for thousands--He can
   do it for you. Pride is a filthiness of the spirit. God treats it as
   such. It is so offensive that He does not come near it,


   "But the proud he knoweth afar off."--Ps. 138:6.

   We can lay aside all its outward manifestations, and then, with
   confidence ask God to take the unholy disposition from our hearts.

   Again the apostle says,


   "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye
   present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
   which is your reasonable service."--Rom. 12:1.

   Here again, we have the second blessing. They were already brethren.
   But in order to prove that "this is the will of God, even your
   sanctification," we are entreated to "present our bodies a living
   sacrifice."

   This implies a consecration of every thing, even our lives, to the
   service of God. All our powers are to be employed as He directs. If our
   bodies are given to God, they must be fed and clothed and used for Him.
   We cannot follow the fashions of the world in any particular in which
   they conflict with the plain directions that God has given. We must be
   directed by God in our business, and in all the affairs of life.

   To obtain entire sanctification we must confess our inbred sins, our
   sinful dispositions, which to a greater or less extent remain after one
   is truly sanctified to God.


   "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."--1 Jon. 1:9.

   That is, if we confess the sins we have committed, God is faithful to
   forgive us; for He has promised to do it. If we confess our inbred sins
   He is faithful to cleanse us from them from all unrighteousness. This
   is what Mr. Wesley means by the "Repentance of believers." "The
   repentance consequent upon justification, is widely different from that
   which is antecedent to it. This implies no guilt, no sense of
   condemnation, no consciousness of the wrath of God. It does not suppose
   any doubt of the favor of God or any fear that hath torment.' It is
   properly a conviction, wrought by the Holy Ghost, of the sin which
   still remains in our heart; of the "phronema sarkos," carnal mind,
   which does still remain (as our church speaks) even in them that are
   regenerate; although it does no longer reign; it has not now dominion
   over them. It is a conviction of our proneness to evil, of a heart bent
   to backsliding, of the still continuing tendency of the flesh to lust
   against the Spirit. Sometimes, unless we continually watch and pray, it
   lusteth to pride, sometimes to anger, sometimes to love of the world,
   love of ease, love of honor or love of pleasure more than of God. It is
   a conviction of the tendency of our heart to self-will, to atheism or
   idolatry, and, above all, to unbelief, whereby, in a thousand ways, and
   under a thousand pretenses, we are ever departing, more or less, from
   the living God."

   To be sanctified wholly we must trust implicitly in God, through the
   merits of Jesus Christ to do the work now. Just as long as we put it
   off in the future, just so long the work will be delayed. A belief that
   it will be done sometime will not bring the blessing. Nor will the
   faith that saves spring up of itself, if we meet all the other
   conditions. It is an active trust that must be voluntarily, consciously
   exercised. "But what is the faith whereby we are sanctified saved from
   sin and perfected in love? It is a divine evidence and conviction,
   first, that God hath promised it in the Holy Scripture. Secondly. It is
   a divine evidence and conviction that what God hath promised He is able
   to perform. It is thirdly, a divine evidence and conviction that He is
   able and willing to do it now. And why not? Is not a moment to Him the
   same as a thousand years? He cannot want more time to accomplish
   whatever is His will."

   Again: "Certainly you may look for it now, if you believe it is by
   faith, and by this token you may surely know whether you seek it by
   faith or by works. If by works, you want something to be done first,
   before you are sanctified. You think, I must first be or do thus or
   thus. Then you are seeking it by works unto this day. If you seek it by
   faith, you may expect it as you are; and if as you are, then expect it
   now."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 20

  HOW RETAINED

   It is not necessary to teach us how to lose our health. Works on
   Hygiene do not attempt to do that. A simple neglect of the laws of
   health will bring on disorder, disease, and finally death. To become a
   confirmed dyspeptic one does not need to commit some striking and
   willful act of disobedience to the laws of our physical being. Many a
   person has lost his health without being able to tell how he lost it.

   So the Bible does not teach us how to lose holiness. It gives us very
   explicit directions how to keep it. We give a few.


   "The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another,
   and toward all men even as we do toward you: to the end he may stablish
   your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the
   coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."--I Thess. 3:12,
   13. "If ye do these things ye shall never fall, for so an entrance
   shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of
   our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."--II Peter 1:10, 11. "Who are kept
   by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed
   in the last times."--I Peter 1:5.

   Notice, in each of these passages there is something spoken of for us
   to do if we would keep holiness and get through to Heaven. In the
   first, we are told that we must "increase and abound in love one toward
   another and toward all men." What we had when we were converted, or
   when we were sanctified wholly is not sufficient. It is not enough that
   we grow in knowledge; there must be a marked increase in love. We must
   abound in it--not merely toward those who love us, but toward "all
   men."

   In the second passage we are directed to do certain things. By
   reference to the preceding verses we shall find that the "things to be
   done" in order that we may "never fail," are Christian graces to be
   added to the beginnings of these graces received when we were converted
   and when we were sanctified wholly.

   Some lakes and inland seas are without outlets; but none are without
   inlets. Insensible evaporation would soon dry up the largest of them,
   if its waters were not receiving a constant addition. The sturdiest
   tree would soon die if it could derive no nourishment from earth or
   air. So no matter how much grace a person received when he was
   converted, and how great an increase was realized when he was
   sanctified wholly, if he does not go on in his experience and grow in
   grace he will become dry and unfruitful, spiritually dead, and
   insensible to his condition. His outward conduct may be without
   reproach, but his power is gone. To keep a house in good order repairs
   must be made as need requires; to keep wealth one must be acquiring
   wealth; to keep learning one must be adding to his store of learning,
   and to keep holiness one must be steadily "perfecting holiness in the
   fear of the Lord."

   In the third passage quoted, we are taught that it is the power of God
   that keeps us. This is frequently stated in the Scriptures.


   "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you
   faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy."--Jude
   24.

   God's power is adequate to carry us safely through any emergency that
   can possibly arise. However numerous and strong may be our enemies, God
   can easily overcome them. Whatever difficulties may stand in our way He
   can remove them. If a sea lies in our path He can open a passage
   through it. If a mountain would stop our progress He can give us wings
   like an eagle and enable us to soar above it. In the furnace He can
   keep us. In the desert He can feed us. Nothing is too great or too hard
   for the power of God. It is almighty. He who is kept by the power of
   God is kept in safety. He is willing, nay anxious to keep us all. He is
   just as ready to keep one as another. Then why are not all kept? The
   reason is found in us, and not in God. We are kept through faith. This
   faith is a voluntary trust on our part. One is kept, because he, of his
   own free will, exercises faith in God. Another doubts, and thus severs
   his union with God, and he in consequence falls into darkness and at
   last into sin.

   There are many passages of Scripture which teach that we are kept by
   the infinite love and power of God. But, like those we have considered,
   they imply or express conditions which we are to meet. These conditions
   are important. If we meet them, we keep the grace which God has given
   us. If we fail to meet them then we lose the blessing of holiness. Many
   lose it in this way without knowing it. This was the case with the
   minister of the church of Ephesus. He was so active, so patient, so
   orthodox, and so zealous for the purity of the church that he had not
   the slightest idea that he had met with any serious loss. His zeal
   against evil-doers and false teachers, had taken the place of the
   tender love he had in other days. He considered himself radical, and
   uncompromising, and established in the faith. But Christ pronounced him
   fallen.

   Reader, have you had a clear experience of being sanctified wholly? If
   not, then seek it at once. You cannot afford to live another day
   without it.

   If you have obtained this blessing are you keeping it, clear and fresh?
   You may keep up the profession. Many do, long after they have lost the
   blessing. There may be nothing particularly amiss in their conduct or
   conversation, but they do not bring forth the fruits of holiness. They
   have not its joy or its power. They lack its gentleness, its meekness,
   its simplicity. Their profession is based upon reasoning or habit, and
   not upon the direct witness of the Spirit.

   Beloved, how is it with you at the present time? Are you fulfilling the
   conditions on which the keeping of the blessing of holiness depends? If
   you are not increasing and abounding in that tender, unselfish love
   that makes you careful of the reputation of others, and considerate of
   their interests and happiness; if you are reckless in your statements,
   and ready with damaging insinuations against those who do not agree
   with your opinions; or if, on the other hand, you are light and
   trifling, gradually conforming to the world in your conversation, in
   your dress, and in your business, then you have every reason to believe
   that you have lost the blessing of holiness. Be honest with yourself:
   welcome the light, and humble yourself before God, and seek to be right
   with Him no matter how much of humiliation it may involve.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 21

  HOW LOST

   Holiness is voluntary. It is a moral state. But a moral action implies
   freedom of choice No one is praised or blamed, rewarded or punished,
   for doing that which could not possibly be avoided. But the holy are
   rewarded, the unholy are punished. Therefore a holy person is holy from
   choice.

   But a voluntary state may be lost. The helm that can be turned in a
   right direction can also be turned in a wrong direction. The vessel
   that has been kept in the channel for years may at last, be run upon a
   rock.

   One who has walked in the way of holiness for a season, may yield to
   temptation and turn aside. It is true that the longer one walks with
   God, the more securely he walks. The nearer a body moves to the sun,
   the stronger it is attracted towards the sun. But comets that come very
   near to the sun at times, finally take a turn and fly off into space.
   Those who get very near to the Lord are likely to press on and grow in
   grace; but they may fall, and get away from the Lord. David was, for
   years, a holy man, fully approved of the Lord; but he fell into sin.
   Paul was caught up into the third heaven where he saw things that
   language could not describe. Yet Paul was keenly alive to the fact that
   he might lose the grace he had received and be finally lost. His
   watchfulness was great and constant. He says,


   "I keep under my body and bring it into subjection: lest that by any
   means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a
   castaway."--I Cor. 9:27.

   It is evident then, that one who has experienced the blessing of
   holiness, can lose it. He need not; he should not; but still he may.
   There is a possibility that he may fall away.

   In what relation does one stand to God who has lost the blessing of
   holiness? Can one lose the blessing of entire sanctification and still
   retain the blessing of justification? These are important questions
   which should be examined carefully.

   When one falls into actual sin he loses both justification and
   sanctification. He falls into condemnation. He is no longer a saint; he
   becomes a sinner. If he gets back to God, he must come confessing his
   sins and seeking pardon.


   "Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;
   let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his
   way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of
   sins."--Jas. 5:19, 20.

   It is a brother who has erred. Not a false professor, but a real
   Christian. He is to be converted like any other sinner. If not
   converted, his soul is in danger of death.

   Again one may lose the blessing of entire sanctification by giving way
   to doubts and unbelief. It is by faith we stand. Whatsoever ground we
   gain by faith we hold by faith. By unbelief we lose it. He who walks on
   the water by faith, goes down, as fear supplants his faith. One may
   also lose the blessing of holiness by failing to confess it. In the
   same degree that profession becomes indefinite, the experience becomes
   indefinite. Doubt lies at the bottom of this want of confession. Satan
   is ever ready to accuse a saint of God. But to hold his ground he must
   keep fully consecrated to God and confess out boldly all that God does
   for him.


   "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of
   their testimony: and they loved not their lives unto the death."--Rev.
   12:11.

   When one listens to the accusations of Satan and fails to bear a clear
   testimony of his being washed by the blood of the Lamb, he loses the
   blessing. The witness is gone. But he does not necessarily fall into
   sin. He may still be keenly alive to the fear of God. He may still
   watch against sin and have victory over it. He may still truly love God
   and faithfully endeavor to keep all His commandments. Such a person in
   losing the blessing of holiness has not lost his justification. He is
   still a child of God. He is sensible of what he has lost and strives to
   regain it.

   To do this it is not necessary that he should throw up all profession
   of religion and begin anew. He is not unholy; but he is holy only in
   part. He should pray to be sanctified wholly. He should confess what he
   has lost. He should consecrate up to all the light that God has given
   him. He should exercise faith in the atoning blood to be again cleansed
   from all sin. He should make no delay, nor wait for some great crisis
   to occur--but should at once come to God to be saved to the uttermost.

   Mr. Fletcher lost the blessing of holiness three times in immediate
   succession, by a simple failure to confess it. But he did not rest
   until he sought and found the grace, and was established in it.

   If you lose any degree of grace, seek to gain it at once and do not
   wait till you have lost more till you make a vigorous effort to regain
   it.


   "Return unto me and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of
   hosts."--Mal. 3:7.

   "Can one lose the blessing of holiness without losing his
   justification?"

   We answer this question again.

   Without any degree of holiness one cannot be in a state of salvation.
   He who is destitute of holiness is not justified. Many appear to think
   that they can possess saving grace without any measure of holiness.
   This is a fundamental error. When God forgives, he says, with power,
   "Go, sin no more." Such a change is wrought, instantaneously, in the
   moral nature of one whom God forgives, that from that moment he has
   power over his sinful appetites and passions. We must never lose sight
   of the great truth that


   "He that committeth sin is of the devil."--I John 3:8.

   In the popular religion of the day, this plain statement of the beloved
   disciple is completely disregarded. It is treated as though it were an
   interpolation, wholly inconsistent with the general teaching of the
   Word of God. But the whole tenor of the Scripture is in harmony with
   the teaching of St. John. There is not, when rightly understood, a
   contradictory passage in the Bible. St. Paul says,


   "And such were some of you; but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified,
   but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit
   of our God."--I Cor. 6:11.

   Notice the order, washed, sanctified, justified. This is God's order in
   saving a soul. An unwashed sinner, wallowing in his sins, is not
   justified. When forgiven he is sanctified, not only in the sense of
   consecrated--that is set apart to do God's will--but in the sense of
   made holy. Not only has he sanctified himself, but he is
   sanctified--that is, God has sanctified him, actually made him holy.
   From being a sinner he has become, in an important sense, a holy man.
   Being thus washed, and sanctified, he is at the same time,
   justified,--that is forgiven--and placed in a state of acceptance with
   God.

   But mark! It does not say sanctified wholly--entirely. He is so far
   sanctified that he has power over sin. He is not under the dominion of
   any of his former sinful appetites or habits. Sin does not have
   dominion over him as it once did. But he feels sinful tendencies
   remaining in his heart. He has, at times, to repress pride, to keep it
   down. He does not yield to anger, but sometimes he feels it, and
   suppresses it. He comes to God, confesses and bewails these inbred sins
   and is cleansed from them. He reads, "And the very God of peace
   sanctify you wholly." He believes for it to be done in himself--and it
   is done. He is sanctified wholly.

   Can he be kept in this state? He can.


   "I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
   unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."--I Thess. 5:23.

   But our being kept in this state depends upon our meeting certain
   conditions.

   1. We must steadily believe.


   "Kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation."--I Pet. 1:5.

   2. Suitable confession.


   "With the mouth confession is made unto salvation."--Romans 10:10.

   3. Obedience.


   "He became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey
   him."--Heb. 5:9.

   We see then that the blessing of holiness may be lost by doubting, by
   failing to confess what God has done for us, and also by actual willful
   disobedience. When one loses the blessing of holiness by transgression,
   as David did, he loses all. He is no longer justified. If he ever gets
   back to God it must be by repentance and confession. His prayer, in
   substance, must be,


   "Have mercy upon me. O God, according to thy loving kindness, according
   unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
   Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
   sin."--Ps. 51:1, 2.

   In a case like this, when one loses holiness he loses justification.
   There is no controversy about this, all admit it. But when one loses
   the blessing of holiness by giving way to doubts and fears, under
   manifold temptations, the case is different. He has not willingly given
   up anything. The blessing is gone. He feels it--he laments it. He cries
   out, "O that I knew where I might find him!" When I was pastor of a
   church which held to the doctrine of holiness in theory, and persecuted
   those who enjoyed it, one of our members, a quiet, conscientious man,
   obtained the blessing of entire sanctification. He was as happy as he
   could be and continue in the body. He testified to the blessing, with
   great power. But when he attended his class meeting, and his turn came
   to speak, the enemy, transformed as an angel of light, suggested, "If
   you profess the blessing of holiness, your leader will not receive it,
   for he does not believe the doctrine, but if you say you are very happy
   you will confess the truth and no opposition will be aroused." He
   followed the suggestion. But he had no sooner sat down than great
   darkness came upon him, which lasted several months. But all this time
   he was one of the most careful, conscientious Christians. He had lost
   the blessing of holiness, but he had not lost his justification. Then
   our answer to the question is, "It depends on how one loses the
   blessing of holiness whether he loses justification at the same time."
   Sweeping declarations are seldom true. They need generally to be
   qualified. It is not best, unnecessarily, to discourage those who have
   lost some of the grace they once enjoyed. When they are on their backs
   the way to recover them is not to cut off their heads. Encourage them
   to hold fast that which they have, and to seek for more. Do not fall
   into the mistake that to be faithful, you must discredit the
   professions of those whose lives are in harmony with their professions,
   because they were not saved under your labors. God has many saints that
   you never saw nor helped. Satan is the accuser of the brethren.
   Suspicion is no proof of piety. Be more ready to build up than to tear
   down, to lead on than to drive back.


   "Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God."--Isa. 40:1.

CHAPTER 22

  PROFESSING HOLINESS

   It is a subtle artifice of Satan to try to get us to make the
   performance of one duty answer for the performance of another duty
   equally plain and important. This is a point that needs to be well
   guarded.

   If you would be holy you must live holiness. This is of the utmost
   importance. But when the false teachers tell you that this can take the
   place of a profession of holiness do not listen to them.

   Profess holiness, if you have holiness. No matter how unpopular it may
   be, confess out all that the Lord does for you.


   "For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the
   mouth confession is made unto salvation."--Rom. 10:10.

   Mark. It is with he mouth that confession is made. Keep up the
   confession until you reach eternal salvation.

   The word "sanctify"is one of the words of Christ. It will not do to be
   ashamed of it. Christ prayed for His disciples,


   "Sanctify them through thy truth."--John 17:17.

   If the prayer is fully answered, you dishonor Christ by confessing that
   it is answered in part. That is not the way men do in business. When a
   request is fully met they acknowledge it fully. If Christ not only
   forgives you, but sanctifies you, then it is not enough to say that you
   are forgiven. That is not the whole truth.

   An indefinite profession will lead to an indefinite experience. The eye
   that is not used grows dim. The faith that is not professed, for fear
   of giving offense, vanishes.


   "From him that hath not," so surely that he cannot profess it, "shall
   be taken away even that which he hath."--Matt. 25:29

   Profess out clearly and definitely all that God does for you. Only see
   to it, as an old writer says, "That the bottom of your life is on a
   level with the top of your profession." Let the most objectionable
   things that you do be perfectly consistent with the highest profession
   that you make.

   If you enjoy it, and live it, by all means profess it. If God sets this
   great light in the soul no one has a right to cover it up. Let it
   shine. Confess all that Divine grace does for you. No one can long
   retain this great blessing without letting it be known that God bestows
   it upon him. He would have others encouraged to come to Him for the
   fullness of grace, and so He would have those upon whom He bestows it
   declare His faithfulness.


   "All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless
   thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
   power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
   glorious majesty of his kingdom."--Ps. 145:10-12

   A holy heart is pre-eminently the work of the Lord. It is a creation
   which His power alone can effect. It is the glory of His kingdom.
   Nothing demands a greater exercise of Omnipotence than to make a
   depraved human heart holy. Wherever this mighty act has been performed,
   the saints of God should make it known. They should freely and
   explicitly confess it, to the glory of His name.

   But professions, of themselves, amount to nothing. Unfounded
   professions are common. They are probably not made, in many cases,
   willfully; but in general, once had a good foundation, and are kept up
   from habit, and from the vain hope that the blessing is not lost, but
   only the witness of it. These professors are aware that their strength
   is gone; but they still think it best to make as strong a show of
   resistance as possible; as Lee kept McClellan at bay by pointing long
   wooden cannon toward his camp. That there are those who really enjoy
   the blessing of holiness we have no doubt. Precious humble souls, they
   are walking in all lowliness before the Lord. May your numbers be
   multiplied, and your graces be strengthened and increased!

   There are others whose professions are not well founded. This is
   evident from their fruits. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit.

   Some are wanting in temperance. Their appetites have the ascendency
   over them. They do not keep their bodies under. Deprive them of their
   tobacco for a single day and they are miserable. It does not seem to me
   that we have a right to profess holiness if the deprivation, in the
   providence of God, of any particular thing to eat or drink makes us
   wretched. If the Lord gives us enough to keep soul and body together,
   we should accept it with thankfulness, and go on our way rejoicing.

   Temperance--in the original "enkrateia"--signifies self control, having
   the mastery over one's appetites, and if you have not this mastery, do
   not profess holiness until you obtain it. God can give it to you. Seek
   it earnestly. It may cost you a conflict, but the victory will be worth
   resistance even unto blood.

   Some are wanting in self-denial. They profess to have renounced
   themselves--their own righteousness and ease, and interests, and yet
   they seem to forget that this renunciation amounts to nothing, unless
   it embraces particulars. It would puzzle them to tell wherein they deny
   themselves of any coveted gratification for Christ's sake. We heard
   recently of some precious saints in affluent circumstances, who, after
   giving all they could for the relief of the starving Lancashire
   sufferers, deprived themselves of the use of butter, that they might
   have more to give. In some form or other, self-denial must be practiced
   daily if the blessing of holiness would be retained.

   Some are wanting in non-conformity to the world. Satan has convinced
   them, and alas! they were but too easily convinced, that to gain an
   influence over worldly, gay professors, and lead them into the blessing
   of holiness, they must not be too strict, but must conform to worldly
   fashions to a degree that the Spirit of God would not allow, if they
   listened to His dictates. O, what a fearful mistake is this! To have
   God receive us we must come out and be separate. There is but one
   mediator between God and man, and none, that we read of, between the
   church and the world; and he who assumes to occupy that dubious
   position will, at the last day, notwithstanding all the wonderful works
   that he has done, hear Christ say, "Depart from me, I know you not."
   The heaviest blows that have been ever inflicted upon Christianity,
   have been given by this class of persons. Without designing it perhaps,
   they have, by little and little, lowered the standard of the Gospel,
   until the church has become deluged with a tide of worldliness that
   threatens to sweep away the last vestige of spiritual life. The Church
   grew strong and multiplied under the cruelties of Nero and Domitian;
   but from the effects of the patronage of Constantine it has never
   recovered unto this day.

   It is distressing to hear persons professing holiness when decked out
   in "gold and pearls and costly array," and to hear them say with a show
   of great self-complacency when their inconsistency is hinted at, "O my
   conscience does not condemn me," just as if their conscience were a
   substitute for the explicit word of God.

   Some are wanting in humility. They may be plain in their apparel, but
   there is about them an appearance of pride and self-conceit. They are
   forward and positive in expressing their opinions, and seem to think
   that nothing is done right in which they do not participate. Let us
   remember, beloved, that perfect love is never found only in connection
   with the deepest humility. Do not take up more time in meetings than
   belongs to you. If you are a minister, and occupy your hour in
   preaching, do give the people an opportunity to witness in the social
   meetings, and do not yourself occupy half the time. Such a course does
   not savor of humility. There may be others who have not the gift of
   utterance that you have, who have yet a much richer experience in the
   things of God; it would do you and others good to listen to them. If
   you have true humility, one effect will be to make you "swift to hear
   and slow to speak."

   Others are wanting in love. They may be rooted and grounded in
   doctrine, but not in love. They cannot bear much. They are quick and
   sensitive. In their intercourse with their families there is what
   sounds and looks very much like fretfulness. Little things chafe, annoy
   and irritate. This cannot be where true holiness is enjoyed. It
   produces a calm quiet and evenness of temper that makes itself felt
   everywhere, and especially in the family circle. We may be firm and
   decided with our children without being cross. Anything like scolding
   will not only hurt us but hurt them. If necessary to use the rod of
   correction, do not spare to use it, but let it be in love.

   Let us, beloved, search ourselves. We may be right. Whatever our
   trials, God is willing and desirous to give all needed grace. "Hold
   fast the profession of your faith without wavering," and then live up
   to your profession.

   It is of no use to profess holiness unless you enjoy it in your life.
   That you had it once, is no evidence that you have it now. You may
   still be orthodox in your doctrines, strictly moral in your life,
   faithful in the performance of all the common, outward duties of
   religion,--nay, you may even be devoted to the advocacy of holiness,
   without truly possessing this grace. "Were a man," says Wesley, "as
   harmless as a post, he might be as far from holiness as heaven from
   earth." Holiness is our complete renewal in the image of God,--the
   perfect love of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Ghost given
   unto us, so that we love God with all our heart, and mind, and
   strength, and our neighbor as ourself.

   It is not merely victory over sin,--this is given to every pardoned
   soul,--but it is deliverance from sinful tempers themselves. The old
   man is not simply bound,--he is cast out with all his goods. There is
   not merely a calm, emotionless surrender of ourselves,--a "laying of
   our all upon the altar," but there is a dying out of self which can no
   more take place without deep emotion, than can natural death come upon
   a strong man without painful struggles. The animal life does not
   contend more stoutly with the king of terrors, than does the sinful
   life with the King of grace. The old man does not die until compelled
   to. The death struggles, whether more or less protracted, are real, and
   not imaginary or figurative. Paul said, "I am crucified with
   Christ;"and so does every one say, who has experienced inward holiness.
   But crucifixion is death, and a painful death. No one can give up all
   his cherished plans, and dearest associations, to follow Christ fully
   in the path of humility, reproaches, persecutions and afflictions,
   without a pang. When he makes this surrender, he will know it. But it
   must be made, if the joys of full salvation would be experienced. When
   sinful self ceases to live, then Christ comes in and takes possession.
   The heart emptied of sin, is filled with the Spirit. A peace, which
   passeth all understanding, continually reigns. The ransomed believer
   now rejoices in Christ with "joy unspeakable, and full of glory." No
   words can express the rapture of his soul. Standing upon the tops of
   the mountains, where he is fanned by the breezes of Paradise, and
   ravished by a sight of the celestial city, he shouts aloud the praises
   of God; or, lying low in the valley of humility, he feels "A sacred awe
   that does not move, And all the silent heaven of love."

   His heart is full of gratitude and praise, and out of the abundance of
   his heart, his mouth speaketh.

   There is, we are aware, an experience called holiness, very different
   from this. The professor, in nine cases out of ten, one who has lost
   his first love, and who, therefore, needs to repent like any other
   sinner, is persuaded that he needs the blessing of holiness. He is told
   to deliberately consecrate himself to the Lord,--to "lay all upon the
   altar." When this is done, he is taught that he must believe, upon the
   authority of God's word, that the sacrifice is now accepted; that "the
   altar sanctifies the gift," and that he now enjoys the blessing of
   holiness. If he urges that he does not feel any different,--that he has
   not experienced any change, he is assured that he must live by faith
   and not by feeling, that he must honor God by believing His word. The
   next and last step is to make a profession of holiness, and this must
   be kept up henceforth. Such a process, involving no mortification of
   pride, but rather gratifying it by giving one a reputation for piety,
   becomes popular wherever presented. Many pass through it, profess
   holiness, and deceive themselves to their soul's undoing. They say they
   are "rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; " when,
   in reality, they are "poor and miserable, and blind and naked." They
   are as full of self as ever, conformed to the world, willing to receive
   honor of men, and ready to compromise whenever fashion demands it. They
   wink at popular sins, or boldly apologize for them. We have seen such
   men, with their golden spectacles, and gold or silver beaded canes,
   shutting out of meetings for holiness all testimony against slavery in
   the church,--and women adorned in "gold, or pearls, or costly array,"
   pleading for worldly conformity, because their hearts are set upon
   these things!

   Such persons enjoy holiness? Why, according to the Methodist
   standard,--and such are found among Methodists, they are not
   scripturally awakened, much less converted or sanctified! The "General
   Rules" of Methodism say that "we know that God's Spirit writes on truly
   awakened hearts," the necessity of avoiding evil of every kind,
   especially that which is most generally practiced, such as "Laying up
   treasure on earth,"--but these would make gain of godliness; "Softness
   and needless self-indulgence,"--but these indulge self, in eating,
   drinking, dress, and conversation; "Reading those books that do not
   tend to the knowledge or love of God," such as novels, and the light
   literature of the day; "The putting on of gold and costly apparel," but
   these say their "conscience does not condemn them" for doing so. Yet,
   you profess holiness! Why, according to the standard of your own
   church, you are yet an unawakened sinner? You may occupy a high
   official or social position, may have written a book on the subject of
   holiness you may be justly entitled to the gratitude and respect of the
   church but all this does not prove that you are now in a state of
   salvation. If you do not "deny yourself and take up your cross daily,
   submitting to bear the reproach of Christ, to be as the filth and
   offscouring of the world, and looking that men should say all manner of
   evil of you falsely, for the Lord's sake," you have not, the Methodist
   Discipline says, "really fixed in your soul," even "a desire to flee
   from the wrath to come, and to be saved from your sins!" This is the
   decision which Methodism pronounces upon your condition. And is it not
   the Bible view of the ease? Has not the light that was in thee become
   darkness? O, be honest with yourself! You confess to a loss of power.
   This is so striking that, blinded as you are, you cannot fail to
   perceive it. But if the power is gone, the purity is gone, the Holy
   Ghost, the sanctifier, is gone! Rouse from this state of stupid
   insensibility. Bewail your loss. Humble yourself deeply before God.
   Obtain pardon while you may. Then press on to full salvation. Remember
   that, "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord." Resolve to have the
   real thing if it takes your life. There is an awful warning to those
   who have been living in the way of salvation, and have enjoyed many
   works of the Divine favor, and are full of honors, in the record that
   is given of one, once a favorite of heaven.


   "It came to pass, that when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away
   his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord
   his God."--I Kings 11:4.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 23

  A POWERLESS PROFESSION

   You profess holiness, but do you really enjoy perfect love? A
   profession of holiness without love is like a well without water, like
   a stove without fire, like a tree without fruit. It raises expectations
   only to disappoint them. You let down your bucket for water--it comes
   up empty. You go for warmth but find none. You shake the tree for fruit
   but gather nothing but leaves.

   If your experience is a fruitless one, the fault is not in your
   circumstances but in your experience. You may be a pattern of plainness
   and non-conformity to the world--you may be uncompromising in your
   opposition to its fashions and pleasures--Zeno, the Stoic, was all
   this, and yet he was only a heathen, and not a Christian. But you
   cannot be filled with love to God and man without being a blessing to
   others. Toward those who are striving to do God's will you will have no
   feeling of envy or jealousy. You will not try to cripple their
   influence by lowering them in the estimation of others. You will
   rejoice with them that do rejoice. If they build faster or better than
   you, if you have love, you will not stop work and go to persecuting
   them on that account. If they really cast out devils in the name of
   Jesus, you will not forbid them, though they follow not you.


   "Love envieth not."--I Cor. 13:4.

   Towards those who are out of the way you will feel--not anger -but
   compassion. Suppose they do act wrong, what else could you expect? You
   will not hold them off, nor act distant, as though you feared they
   might pollute you. Jesus came to "seek and to save them that are lost."
   If you have His love you will go after those who go astray. We ask you
   again, Have you perfect love? Read its characteristics in the
   thirteenth chapter of 1st Corinthians. Ask yourself the question, as
   you read them one by one, Is this true of my experience? Am I able to
   suffer long and be kind? Am I free from envy and vanity? Do I not think
   better of those who think well of me, than I do of others of equal
   worth? Does not my opinion of others depend very much on the degree of
   attention which they pay to me?

   A want of usefulness is an unerring sign of a want of love. Admit the
   fact. Stop blaming others. Quit finding fault.

   Some preachers when they see a weakness among their people, give strong
   doses when they ought to take one first themselves. Get a real--not
   affected--love for souls, then your plain dealing will draw them to
   you, instead of driving them away. Then you can, in meekness, instruct
   those who oppose themselves, and God may give them repentance to the
   acknowledging of the truth.

   Seek then, first of all, for a baptism of pure, perfect love upon your
   soul. Do not think you have it when the fruits are wanting. Own your
   need and then you will ask earnestly to have it supplied. God is ready
   to shed abroad His love in your heart by the Holy Ghost given unto you.
   For this, in the work of God, there can be no substitute. Increase of
   zeal may help somewhat--but nothing will fit you to live right and to
   do the good you may, but the fullness of the love of God. Do not, then,
   go another day without it. Is consecration needed to obtain it? Then
   make the consecration without delay. Keep back nothing. Let God have
   all. Present your body a living sacrifice. Let your talents, your time,
   your property, your all be at the disposal of Him to whom you belong.

   Is confession called for? Have you manifested to others an unlovely
   disposition, contrary to the Spirit of Christ? The confession should be
   as broad as the offense. It may be in the family--it may be to those
   who look up to you, that you have exhibited your lack of the "love that
   beareth all things, that endureth all things," but no matter; make the
   confession humbly, and plainly, and without any excuses, and see how
   God will melt your heart and fill you with His love. Be decided upon
   this point. Neglect what you may, do not put off seeking the fullness
   of the love of God. If you have ten talents it will enable you to use
   them to the glory of God;--if you have but one it will enable you to
   make the most of that, and secure to you your eternal reward when the
   work of life is done.

CHAPTER 24

  KINDS OF HOLINESS

   The Scriptures teach that there are two kinds of holiness,--true and
   false. (Eph. 4:24.)

   True holiness, wherever found, is essentially the same. In matters not
   essential there may be a wide difference, but in the essentials there
   is agreement. An English sovereign [coin] and an American eagle [coin]
   were not cast in the same mold and have different inscriptions, but the
   metal of which they are composed is the same. One could be easily
   converted into the other. Whatever form gold is made to assume it
   retains its qualities. So, true holiness has, among all people, and in
   all ages, the same characteristics.

   It is the work of the Holy Spirit. No education however Scriptural, no
   training however religious, can produce it. He who is truly holy is
   sanctified by the Holy Ghost. He has ceased from his own works. As God
   works in him he works out his own salvation. Hence, since true holiness
   has nothing in it of human merit, it is always found in connection with
   deep humility. There is nothing of self in it, and it does not seek
   self-glorification in any form.

   This humility is manifested in every manner. Its possessor dresses
   plain. Nothing is worn for show or ornament. It cannot be told from the
   appearance of a soldier in the ranks whether he is rich or poor, so the
   dress of a saint does not indicate his temporal condition. He is
   unassuming, not claiming superiority over others.

   Another element of true holiness is an all-absorbing love for God and
   man. God is loved, adored, obeyed. Man is loved as the image of God,
   the representative of Christ, and however fallen he may be, he is
   pitied, instructed, helped and elevated.

   True holiness is obtained through faith in God, and it is never
   separated from an unwavering trust in Him. The car separated from the
   locomotive on an up-hill grade soon loses its motion in the right
   direction, and begins to run down hill; the soul which lets go its hold
   of God by unbelief, loses holiness, falls into sin, either of the
   heart, or life, or both, and takes the downward track to perdition.

   False holiness may be classed under several heads. There is an
   aristocratic, self-indulgent holiness. It gives its influence to build
   up fine, costly houses of worship, with popular preachers, choir
   singing, select congregations from which the poor are excluded as
   regular attendants, by selling or renting the seats. It puts on airs,
   dresses sufficiently in style to make the impression that it does not
   belong to the common people. It seeks the society of the upper classes,
   and endeavors to explain away the requirements of the Gospel to suit
   their tastes. It goes as far in self-indulgence as public sentiment
   will permit. Tertullian, about the year A. D. 207, in cutting irony,
   refers to this class of holiness professors "Who, among you, is
   superior in holiness, except him who is more frequent in banqueting,
   most sumptuous in catering, more learned in cups? Men of soul and flesh
   alone as you are, justly do you reject things spiritual." This kind of
   holiness is not generally persecuted by the world. If it is, it is
   ready to apologize, and to put on a less offensive form.

   There is a fanatical holiness. It lays the greatest stress upon that
   for which it has the least reason and Scripture for its support. Its
   self-denial is great, and is only equaled by its self-will. It has in
   it an element of sincerity, but it is vitiated by being consecrated to
   its own will, rather than to the will of God. It lacks the great
   quality of submission. It does not know how to yield, even in matters
   the smallest and most indifferent. It must have its own way in every
   thing. Every one must submit to its dictation or receive its fiery
   denunciation.

   There is a covetous holiness. It wears cheap clothing, but it is to
   avoid expense. It has sharp criticisms for every project that calls for
   an expenditure of money; but it is because it is unwilling to bear its
   part. It may have little, or it may have much, but what it has it holds
   on to with a miser's grasp. Frequently it opposes all church
   organizations, really because it wishes for some excuse for refusing to
   support them. It is mighty at tearing down--it never tries its hand at
   building up. It may burn palaces--it cannot rear a hovel.

   See to it then that you have true holiness. Let your consecration be to
   God. Give yourself up for a habitation of the Holy Spirit. Let Him lead
   you into all truth. Let the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the
   Mount be as much to you as "the exceeding great and precious promises."
   Let them dove-tail together in your experience.

   Take pains to be clothed with humility It is not enough not to feel
   proud, you should not look proud. Be of an humble spirit, then every
   thing about you will show forth that spirit.

   Whatever you lack, do not lack that sanctification


   "without which no man shall see the Lord."--Heb. 12:14.

   If you are without it be in haste to obtain it. There is no time to be
   lost. Eternity is at hand. The great preparation for it is true
   holiness. It must be obtained here. The death-bed may be too late.
   Consecrate yourselves fully to God. Obey the leadings of the Spirit.
   Make every confession He prompts you to make. Take any position He
   directs you to take. Trust fully in Christ. Rely on Him. Believe His
   every promise, but, above all, believe in Him.

CHAPTER 25

  DEFECTIVE HOLINESS

   Holiness belongs especially to the Lord. In Him it is pure, unmixed and
   underived. Hence He is called THE HOLY ONE, as if the name Holy and God
   are the same.


   "They have provoked the Holy One of Israel." Isa. 1:4. "But shall stay
   upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel." Isa. 10:20.

   The Messiah in like manner is called the Holy One.


   "Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."--Ps.
   16:10. "I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God."--Luke 4:34.

   Holiness in man is often defective. It may be wanting in some of its
   essential elements. Hence in the Scriptures we find some qualifying
   terms applied to holiness when used in connection with human beings.


   "Put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and
   true holiness."--Eph. 4:24.

   This implies that there is a false holiness--that which passes for
   holiness though wanting in some of its essential properties.


   "That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him
   without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of
   our life."-- Luke 1:74, 75.

   The phrase, "before him," is the highest form of a superlative, and
   denotes a holiness and righteousness which will bear the scrutiny of
   God's all-searching eye.

   The holiness of the day is so ineffective because so much of it is
   defective. The load does not move because so much of the steam is lost.
   The medicine does not cure because it is combined with so many
   neutralizing substances. The gold is not current because mixed with so
   much alloy. Let us see to it that we have true holiness.

   Much of the current holiness is wanting in spirituality. It has a
   worldly aspect. Generally it talks after a worldly manner. It keeps up
   a profession of holiness where it is popular to profess holiness. But
   in general its conversation is of the earth, earthy. It lacks the odor
   of sanctity. It does not bear the solemn, heavenly aspect of one who
   holds communion with God. Notwithstanding its efforts to the contrary
   it carries it with it and diffuses wherever it goes a worldly spirit.

   Much of it is wanting in loyalty to God. While God is nominally
   acknowledged as Sovereign, the supreme allegiance is given to self, or
   to society, or to the church. Some yield to the claims of holiness
   until they appear to interfere with their worldly interest. They give a
   positive testimony to holiness until they discover that some whose good
   opinion they covet treat them with coldness in consequence. Then they
   are guarded or silent. They set out to meet the requirements of the
   Bible on dress; but when they find it brings upon them reproach and
   persecution, they go with the multitude and are conformed to this
   world.

   Some meet the requirements of holiness as far as they can and keep in
   harmony with the authorities of the church. They have their convictions
   clear and positive. As far as the usages of the church are in harmony
   with these convictions, they stand by them firmly. But let them be
   expressed ever so plainly in the standards of church doctrine, yet if
   the church disregards them in practice, they readily fall in with it
   and act directly contrary to the clearest convictions that God gives
   them. A wealthy member of the M. E. Church saw clearly that the
   practice of renting or selling seats in the house of worship is
   contrary to the Scriptures. They needed a new church. He was asked to
   head the subscription. He offered to if they would make the seats free.
   The preacher insisted they could not build a free-seated church. The
   Christian man offered to build one himself if they would make the seats
   free. His offer was accepted and he built a large, convenient church.
   Only a few years elapsed before the preachers persuaded him to consent
   to rent the seats in that very church.

   By artful management the most iniquitous decisions are obtained in the
   church tribunals against some of its most devoted and godly ministers.
   Men claiming to be advocates of holiness, who would have defended these
   proscribed ones if they had chanced to be in a majority, close their
   ears to the strongest testimony, and give to the merest phantoms of the
   imagination all the authority of Sacred Writ. A holiness that ignores
   the claims of justice only as they are sanctioned by the majority, a
   holiness that acknowledges no higher fealty than loyalty to the church,
   that makes it its highest duty to stand by those in power, do what they
   may, is treason to God. It is a refined, subtle idolatry--but an
   idolatry not less damning than that which leads its votaries to bow
   down to stocks and stones. A saint yields his highest allegiance to
   God. Truth and justice he recognizes as attributes of God, and however
   they may be trampled in the dust he knows he cannot be false to them
   and at the same time be true to God.

   It was this disposition to stand by the truth of God in each other when
   the authorities of church and state were arrayed against it, that made
   the primitive Christians invincible. Paul writes,


   "But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were
   illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly whilst ye
   were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions; and
   partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For ye
   had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of
   your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and
   an enduring substance."--Heb. 10:32-34.

   Lucian was a celebrated Greek writer and an enemy of the Christian
   religion. He flourished about the year of our Lord 176. In speaking of
   Christians he says: "It is incredible what expedition they use when any
   of their friends are in trouble. In a word they spare nothing upon such
   an occasion; for these miserable men have no doubt they shall be
   immortal and live forever; therefore they contemn death, and many
   surrender themselves to sufferings. Moreover their first law-giver has
   taught them, that they are all brethren, when they have turned and
   renounced the gods of the Greeks, and worship that Master of theirs who
   was crucified, and engage to live according to His laws. They have a
   sovereign contempt for all the things of this world, and look upon them
   as common."

   If this doctrine of supreme loyalty to the church had prevailed in our
   Saviour's time, Christianity could never have been established. For
   Christ was crucified by the authorities of the church: and that too,
   not by one church among many, but at the instigation of the chief
   priests of the only church of God then on the earth--a church founded
   by Abraham and sanctioned by the working among them from age to age of
   wonders and miracles, and made rich by the wisdom and illustrious, by
   the piety of prophets whom God raised up among them from time to time.

   If loyalty to the church be our first duty, then were Luther and Wesley
   heretics and schismatics and not the reformers we are accustomed to
   consider them. The very foundation principle of the reformation is,
   that every soul owes its first and highest allegiance to God. On no
   other principle can the reformation be defended.

   Preachers and churches are helps in their appropriate places but when
   they require one to do what God forbids then, cost what it may, God
   must have the preference.

   If masonry be, as is clearly shown by the late President Finney, by
   President Blanchard and others, and in our tract entitled "False
   Religion," a rival and hostile religion to Christianity, then that
   holiness is defective which closes its eyes to this great fact and
   sustains Masonic preachers in its churches.

   If selling or renting pews in houses of worship is a plain violation of
   the prohibition to have respect of persons in seating congregations,
   and is contrary to the spirit and teaching of the Gospel, then that
   holiness is defective which gives its sanction or support to this
   anti-Christian practice.

   If the Bible requires plainness of dress and forbids Christians to
   adorn themselves with "braided hair or gold or pearls or costly array,"
   then is that holiness defective which pays no attention to these plain
   commands, but conforms to the fashions of the world in things plainly
   forbidden by the Word of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 26

  FALSE HOLINESS

   It is a false holiness, which is built upon a false assumption.


   "Sanctify them through thy truth."--John 17:17.

   It is a false assumption which takes it for granted that those who
   maintain a respectable standing in a respectable Church are therefore
   justified. Some of them are. Many are not.


   "By their fruits ye shall know them."--Matt. 7:20.

   Some love the world. They do not attempt to conceal it.


   "If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." I
   John 2:15.

   They seek the friendship of the world. For this purpose they enter into
   voluntary associations of a purely worldly character. They give these
   the preference over the Church of Christ. They are found at the lodge
   more frequently than at the prayer-meeting.


   "Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the
   world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the
   world is the enemy of God."--Jas. 4:4.

   People of this class need pardon first. They are under
   condemnation--and should be led to see it--for they walk not after the
   Spirit, but after the flesh. If they have ever been in the way of life
   they have erred from the truth. They must be converted. (Jas. 5:19). To
   encourage them to think that they are in a state of salvation, is to
   encourage them to believe a lie. To build a structure of holiness on
   this foundation is doing a work that in all probability will not stand.
   Those who are honest, finding that they have not received the blessing
   which they thought they did receive, will be quite likely to conclude
   that all is delusion. Those who are not honest will gladly take up with
   the delusion, and may hold on to it till they die, to their eternal
   undoing.

   Live holiness! Talk holiness! Preach holiness! If souls who are under
   condemnation are truly awakened by the Spirit, they will, even though
   they go forward for holiness, soon begin to pray for pardon. Encourage
   them to go on with this prayer until it is answered. Do not try to
   persuade them that they are better off than the Spirit shows them that
   they are. Let them go to the bottom, and confess all that God shows
   them they ought to confess. Let them seek until the Spirit answers to
   the blood, and tells them they are born of God. Having obtained pardon
   for sin, and victory over sin, they will be in a condition to go
   forward and seek true holiness. They will not feel like closing their
   eyes to the light, and make popular usage a substitute for the word of
   God. The fullest consecration which the Spirit demands will be
   cheerfully made. They will not consecrate up to the point of popularity
   and stop there--nor up to the point of loyalty to the Church and stop
   there. Where the Holy Ghost leads they will cheer fully follow. They
   will not close their eyes to popular sins, under the pretense that they
   do not understand them--they will not hesitate to espouse the right
   because they stand alone.

   It is a false holiness which takes the courage all out of a man and
   makes him the supple tool of the artful and the designing. The
   religious instincts of a soul truly saved of God are a safer guide for
   him than the logic of others. He wants to know what God would have him
   know. He wants to stand where God would have him stand.

   That we are in danger of taking up with a false holiness, is clearly
   implied in many passages of the Scriptures. The Apostle's expression
   "True holiness," implies that there is a false. The numerous
   exhortations against being deceived, also imply this.

   Be careful then, as you prize the salvation of your soul, and do not
   take up with a false holiness. Buy, at any cost, the "gold tried in the
   fire."

   Do not countenance the promotion of false holiness. Examine carefully
   the character of the preaching which you support, and of the books and
   periodicals which you circulate. Give your endorsement to nothing that
   will not stand the test of the judgment day. Be decided on this point.
   Take your stand for a genuine work. The necessity is laid upon us.


   "For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."--II Cor.
   13:8.

   There is no end to counterfeits. As soon as one is exposed, another is
   put into circulation. It is so in the financial world; it is so in the
   religious world. But there is this difference, no one wishes to take a
   bad dollar, while the great majority appear to prefer a bad religion.
   The crowds which go to hear Mr. Moody, appear to think they have done
   well if they go to hear him without paying any thing; while of the
   crowd that goes to hear Mr. Ingersoll blaspheme, each individual will
   pay his half dollar, or dollar, without complaining.

   A few years ago it was the fashion to fight holiness. It is now
   becoming the fashion to preach holiness. But there is a great
   difference in the kind of holiness preached. All is not gold that
   glitters. All is not holiness that passes for it. There is still what
   the Apostle calls "true holiness;" and there is a false holiness.

   We went to hear one of the divines in attendance upon the Prophetic
   Conference lately held in Chicago, preach on "Sanctification." It was
   an able, exhaustive sermon. The whole tenor of it was false and
   flattering. It assumed that the whole meaning of the term was being
   "set apart for holy purposes." Thus the place where sacrifices were
   offered was a holy place; the altar was sanctified; the first born were
   sanctified. But he said their character was not changed. "So," he said,
   to a fashionable congregation, "if you are believers, you are
   sanctified, you may be the subjects of infirmities; you may fail in a
   thousand things, but your sanctification is complete. You are complete
   in Christ." This, he maintained, is the condition of all believers. But
   it implies no change in their characters.

   They should strive to have their character and conduct correspond to
   their condition. If they persevered they would improve, but they could
   never attain in this life the perfection which God requires.

   The preacher said that Finney and Mahan, and even John Wesley had
   lowered the standard. "God," the preacher said, "requires of man
   nothing less than absolute perfection."

   Is it not strange that, with an open Bible before them, men dare preach
   such doctrines? Under the Old Dispensation, a prophet asked,


   "And what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justly and to love
   mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"--Micah 6:8.

   So Jesus gives, as the great commandment,


   "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
   soul, and with all thy mind."--Matt. 22:37.

   This is plain. It is as reasonable as it is plain. "With all thy
   heart"--not with the heart of an archangel #8212;not even with the
   heart of a superior human being--but "with all thy heart." The weakest,
   the most ignorant can do that. The strongest, the most gifted can do
   nothing more. This is what the Bible means by our being sanctified. It
   is loving God with all our heart and soul and mind.

   But, that sanctification is not merely a change in our condition or
   relation but also a change in our nature, in our character and conduct,
   the Scriptures plainly teach.

   Take one plain passage,


   "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
   whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming
   of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also
   will do it."--I Thess. 5:23, 24.

   This passage carefully considered throws much light upon the subject of
   sanctification. It teaches:

   1. That souls at conversion are sanctified, but not wholly.

   2. That entire sanctification is subsequent to justification. They were
   already justified.

   3. That entire sanctification is God's work--a work done in us by God's
   Spirit.

   4. That it brings soul and body and spirit into a blameless condition;
   for they cannot be preserved blameless until they are first made
   blameless.

   5. That it is attainable, for God is to do it. Who will dare limit the
   power of His grace?

   6. That entire sanctification is attainable now, in this life, for the
   Apostle prays that we may be preserved in this state.

   7. That it is a state from which one need never fall. For the Apostle
   prays that we may be preserved in this state unto "the coming of our
   Lord Jesus Christ." And he adds "Faithful is he that calleth you who
   also will do it." Only do your part and God will do His. There is not a
   single doubt about it.

   Such is a brief outline of the teaching of one plain passage on this
   subject. Those who profess to be looking for the second, personal
   coming of Christ should be careful that they do not themselves furnish
   an evidence that it is near at hand by "having a form of godliness, but
   denying the power thereof."

   While we look for Christ's second, personal coming we should go to work
   with awe-inspiring earnestness to get ourselves, and as many others as
   we can, prepared for His kingdom and His coming.

   Especially should we put forth definite, well-directed efforts to
   spread every where the doctrine and the experience of that


   "holiness without which no man shall see the Lord."--Heb. 12:14.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 27

  A FIGHTING HOLINESS--"SANCTIFICATION IN STREAKS"

   I do not mean those who fight holiness, but use the word fighting as an
   adjective to describe holiness.

   The phrase may be used in a bad sense and a good sense. A professor of
   religion who is all alive to his own importance, ready to join issue
   with everybody on every occasion who differs with him, to put the worst
   construction upon the actions and the worst meaning to the words of
   others, who stirs up strife and divisions wherever he goes, has a bad
   kind of warring holiness. He may be zealous to reform yet does but
   little towards promoting "on earth peace, and good will toward men." He
   is very apt to substitute bitterness for love, presumption for faith,
   obstinacy for firmness. Men who are naturally pugnacious, even when
   truly sanctified, are liable to lose the fullness of love, and then
   become quarrelsome: and if, as is generally the case, they keep up
   their profession of holiness, they prejudice sensible people against
   the doctrine, and do a vast amount of harm.

   But true holiness is not the easy, obsequious, compromising principle
   that many appear to think that it is--it is brave as a hero and at the
   same time gentle as a woman. It is valiant for the truth. When called
   upon, it is ready to defend it, and if need be to die for it. The man
   of God is solemnly charged--


   "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life."--I Tim.
   6:12.

   Our Lord says,


   "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send
   peace, but a sword."--Matt. 10:34.

   Wherever sin and true holiness come in contact there must be war.

   All eminent saints have been great warriors. Paul describes his life at
   its close by saying, "I have fought a good fight." Luther and Wesley
   and Finney were mighty men of war.

   But see to it that in the midst of all your fightings you keep filled
   with love.

   We have a Presbyterian brother--a devout man of God, and an able
   preacher--who holds to the doctrine of sanctification. He says that, as
   a matter of fact, he finds that those professing holiness are generally
   "sanctified in streaks." Is there not too much ground for this
   observation?

   Some evidently love the world. They gain all they can, and save all
   they can,--but they do not give all they can. They have enough, and
   more than enough, to make themselves and those dependent on them
   comfortable as long as they live. Still they go on laying up for
   themselves "treasures on earth." Some make a gain of godliness. Even
   "holiness camp-meetings"are so managed that a good deal of money is
   made out of them. The ground for tents to stand on is rented at a large
   profit; the tents and furniture are rented at a profit; and even the
   railroads--grasping as are these corporations--are made to share with
   the managers, the profits of carrying the worshipers to these great
   gatherings. If those who labor specially to promote holiness set such
   an example of money-making, is it to be wondered at if the same spirit
   should be imbibed by others?

   Some are greatly wanting in meekness and humility. They put on style.
   In their dress, they violate the plain rules of Scripture. They mince
   their words, and affect a high degree of social refinement in their
   manner of speaking.

   Others are too forward. They never know their place. If they cannot
   lead, they balk. They must be foremost, or they will not work at all.
   If you disagree with them in opinion, they take it that you are their
   enemy. An effort to correct anything that is really objectionable, they
   count as persecution. They are not "easy to be entreated."

   Some are wanting in self-denial. They live in ease and self-indulgence.
   They do not seem to know what it is to deny themselves of anything for
   Jesus' sake.

   Beloveds, the Gospel proposes to effect in each one of us a perfect
   cure. We are sanctified


   "through the truth."--John 17:17.

   This cannot be too strongly impressed upon the mind. You will be
   sanctified only so far as you receive the truth. If your views of truth
   are defective or distorted, there will be a corresponding defect or
   distortion in your piety. Do not be rickety Christians, with a head
   disproportional to the rest of your body. SEARCH THE SCRIPTURES. Aim at
   a full and harmonious development of all the Christian graces. If you
   find you are defective in any respect, do not peevishly throw away the
   whole of your experience, and go over the same old, beaten road again,
   but come to God for that particular grace. Persevere in prayer until
   you get it. Insist upon it that it is your privilege to be right with
   God in all respects. Be willing to know your faults; for until you know
   them you will never seek deliverance from them. Welcome the light.


   "And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and
   to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance
   patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly
   kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity."--II Pet. 1:5-7.

CHAPTER 28

  HOLINESS BEFORE THE LORD

   Everything valuable has its counterfeit. Mock marriages, spurious
   medicines, base coins, have always deceived many, and yielded a harvest
   of sorrow in place of looked-for joy.

   Holiness is an attribute of God. It is an essential attribute. It is
   the want of holiness which makes Satan the devil.

   Holiness is the great want of man. Without it he cannot go to a Heaven
   which sin never defiles, and whose every inhabitant is holy. No degree
   of talent, no amount of learning, no abundance of riches can compensate
   for the want of holiness.

   It is not then wonderful that Satan, transformed into an angel of
   light, should bend all his energies to produce a close imitation of
   holiness. He succeeds so admirably that he would deceive, if possible,
   the very elect.

   The Scriptures give us plain warning. If we take any counterfeit,
   however spurious, for genuine holiness, ours is the fault, and the
   resulting loss. At the very opening of the Gospel we are put upon our
   guard. Zacharias, filled with the Spirit, blessed God for the coming of
   Christ to perform the mercy promised to our fathers;


   "The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, that he would grant
   unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might
   serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all
   the days of our life."--Luke 1:73-75.

   The phrase "before God" is a superlative expression, and denotes that
   whatever it is applied to is really and truly what it appears to be.
   God sees through all disguises. He is never deceived. So when the
   sacred writers wish to express that which is true and real they use the
   phrase, "before God." Thus it is said,


   "The earth also was corrupt before God."--Gen. 6:11.

   That is, it was thoroughly and generally corrupt. Of Zacharias and
   Elizabeth it is said,


   "They were both righteous before God."--Luke 1:6.

   They were really and consistently righteous. So the phrase "holiness
   and righteousness before the Lord" implies that there is a holiness
   that will not bear the inspection of God's all-searching eye. The same
   idea is conveyed by Paul,


   "Put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and
   true holiness."--Eph. 4:24.

   Why this qualifying word "true?" The inspired writers do not use such
   terms at random. "True holiness" implies that there is a false. This is
   evident. The Scriptures then put us on our guard. We must, therefore,
   examine carefully the holiness teachings which seek our approval. Are
   they in harmony with the teachings of the Bible? They may be in some
   respects and yet be radically wrong. The doctrines we receive are the
   invisible chains that bind us to a life of faith and obedience. But a
   chain is no stronger than its weakest link. So, much that passes for
   holiness will be found defective in the day when its strength is
   tested.

   This defective holiness is rapidly on the increase. It is becoming
   popular. It excites little opposition, provokes little persecution.

   1. Bible holiness implies a settled hatred of sin. A holy person puts
   away all sin. He gives it no countenance, either in himself or others.
   And he calls that sin which God calls sin. No one says, "I will go and
   commit some sin against God." But he does something which God says he
   must not do, or he neglects to do something which God says he must do.
   Talk about consecrating some favorite idol to the Lord! God says put it
   away. You may consecrate as much as you please, but God will have
   nothing to do with it. The goodly Babylonish garment and the wedge of
   gold he will not accept even if consecrated.

   God says, "Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of
   plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or putting on of
   apparel."--I Pet. 3:3. Many holiness teachers not only do not enforce
   this command, but they set the example of its open violation. We have
   seen gentlemen holiness teachers with ornaments of gold plainly in
   view; and lady teachers waving ostrich plumes upon their bonnets. Yet
   they make a very strong profession of being saved from sin. But the
   trouble is they do not call it sin to break a plain command of the
   Bible which it is popular to break. Their rule of conduct is, not the
   word of God, but the usages of what is called good society. According
   to their method of teaching, the Bible must be construed, no matter
   what violence is done to its language, so as not to offend the popular
   sentiment. This quality that aims to please, and never to give offense,
   that suppresses in religious gatherings all plain testimony against
   worldly conformity in dress or needless worldly associations, by
   joining secret societies, may appear amiable and attractive; but it is
   not Bible holiness. To call it so is misleading. Its proper name is
   politeness, and not holiness. Well-bred people of the world act in the
   same way when it does not conflict with their interests. Understand us.
   We do not say that this easy complacency is all wrong. In a worldly
   sense it may do good. It smoothes much of the asperity of daily life.
   It is as oil to lessen the friction which results from the intercourse
   of persons of opposite views and conflicting interests. But it is not
   Bible holiness. It is wanting in the fundamental element--that love for
   God which leads one to obey all his commands. It fatally mistakes a
   love of popularity for the love of God. This is not the holiness of
   George Fox and John Wesley and Charles G. Finney. These men of God bore
   clear, ringing testimonies against popular sins. Theirs was not that
   complacent, man-pleasing spirit that fears to offend the world. They
   gave no quarters to popular sin.

   2. Bible holiness implies that the heart is filled with love--genuine
   love to God and man. It reproves, but it does it in the spirit of
   meekness. It bears an out-and-out testimony against popular sins, but
   it does it in kindness and not in anger; for conscience sake and not to
   gratify a spirit of resentment.

   The great skill of the deceiver is shown in pushing earnest souls into
   the one extreme or the other. Some of the zealous advocates of holiness
   not only reprove sin but they undertake to anathematize all who dare to
   disagree with them. To oppose their course they call fighting against
   God. Let one do it ever so mildly and he is assailed by the most
   opprobrious epithets they can use. This furious zeal they call
   holiness. And the strangest part of it is they get some honest souls to
   accept their leadership and indorse all they do and say. These fierce
   propagandists, with tongues and pens like a sharp two-edged sword,
   manifest a spirit that we would look for rather among the devotees of
   Islam than among the followers of Christ.

   A holy person does not indulge in fierce vituperation and denunciation.
   He is uncompromising--but at the same time gentle and kind.

   Let us then see to it that we walk blameless in holiness "before the
   Lord." Deception can be of no avail. At the best it is short-lived. We
   shall soon enter upon a world of stern realities. We shall, whatever
   estimate we put upon ourselves, be weighed in the undeviating balances
   of God's sanctuary. Let us see to it that we be not found wanting.

CHAPTER 29

  PROMOTING HOLINESS

   That the work of holiness is gaining ground in this country is, we
   think, evident. The labors of those engaged in promoting it are meeting
   with some encouragement. Yet but little is done in comparison of what
   ought to be done. What is the reason?

   One prominent reason is, that in most of the churches the people are
   taught that they can be saved without holiness. This is not done in so
   many words. That would startle the hearers. But the people are made to
   believe that they will go to Heaven, if they join the church and are
   loyal to it, even though they continue to live in sin. Men desire to
   gain advantages on the easiest terms. If two articles, in every respect
   of equal value, are offered for sale, the one for which the lowest
   price is asked is sold first. When people who love the world, its
   fashions, its associations, its honors, its pleasures, are assured that
   they can gain Heaven, by paying the preacher and supporting the church,
   and still hold on to their cherished sins, they naturally choose this
   course.

   We must show that no one can be saved who is not so far made holy that
   he stops committing sin.


   "He that committeth sin is of the devil."--I John 3:8.

   This we must insist on. And also


   "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin."--I John 3:9.

   Those who are made to believe that they can be good Christians and at
   the same time live in sin do not desire to become holy. Why should
   they, if they can at the same time enjoy the pleasures of sin and reap
   the rewards of holiness? We must remove this delusion from the minds of
   the people. We must show that the popular religion of the day is not
   true Christianity. It takes courage to do this in a proper manner. It
   must not be done in a way to create the impression that we are making
   war upon the churches. This would stir up resistance.

   There must be nothing belligerent or pharisaical in our manner. We must
   do it in the spirit in which Paul wrote of the carnal professors of his
   time.


   "For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
   weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ; whose end is
   destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their
   shame, who mind earthly things."--Phil. 3:18, 19.

   That this applies too generally to the members of popular churches,
   their pastors practically acknowledge, by getting up festivals and
   appealing to their appetites when they wish to raise money. There is a
   great difference in the effect between saying this in a harsh,
   censorious, upbraiding spirit, or saying it, as Paul did, with a tender
   heart, even weeping. It is a sad sight,--one to make angels weep,--to
   see pulpits and pews of professedly Christian churches filled with men
   and women who give the most unmistakable evidence of "minding earthly
   things," of living in plain violation of the commands of God. But
   instead of crying "peace and safety" and representing to them that "if
   they go on they will finally get to Heaven," but they "need the
   blessing of holiness to make them more useful," we must show them
   tenderly but plainly from the word of God that the end of the course
   they are pursuing is destruction.

   Where this is done in the Holy Ghost the work of holiness will go on in
   power. The people will be led to repent of their sins; and then go on
   "perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord." They will get an
   experience that fills them with joy; and that will give them power over
   others.

   But when in a church composed of backsliders and of those who never
   were converted, holiness is preached as a blessing that they may
   receive at once, by simply believing, the result is self-deception.
   Many profess entire holiness when at the utmost they have only obtained
   pardon. They are urged to profess the highest state of sanctification
   when they are in the lowest state of justification. And some even
   become the advocates of holiness when, according to the standard laid
   down in the Bible and in the M. E. Discipline, they are not fully
   awakened. The sad sight is witnessed of men preaching holiness who are
   so defiled by tobacco that the pure shrink from coming near them, and
   of women, waving their plumes and flaunting their jewelry professing to
   be saved to the uttermost! This makes sensible people mistrustful of
   the doctrine.

   To promote the work of holiness then, we must not close our eyes to
   this state of things, and act as if it did not exist. A doctor never
   cures the cholera by treating it as if it were only a slight
   irregularity. We must acknowledge the desperate state of the case and
   apply the proper remedy. It will of course stir up conflict, but we
   must meet it in the name of Jesus.

   It is cowardly and criminal for the advocates of holiness to encourage
   professors in self-delusion. It is treason to Christ to persuade those
   who know they love the world, that they are in a state of
   salvation--weak it may be--to be pitied and petted, when they need to
   break down before God and seek forgiveness. Let us do thorough work for
   God.


   "Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully."--Jer.
   48:10.

   The great hindrance to the work of holiness on earth is man's
   depravity. This creates obstacles of every conceivable kind. This
   exists everywhere, wherever man is found. There is no avoiding it. No
   locality can be found in which the people are naturally inclined to
   follow holiness. No people have ever yet been discovered who welcomed
   the pure, unadulterated truth of God, and set themselves to work in
   obedience to its requirements. To induce depraved men to seek holiness
   they must be drawn from above by the Holy Spirit. Without this
   supernatural aid, the natural opposition of man to holiness will never
   be overcome.

   Then, to successfully preach holiness, something more is needed than a
   correct understanding of the doctrine, and to possess the ability to
   state it clearly and defend it with unanswerable arguments. These are
   important. To embrace the truth, people need to see the truth. It is
   unreasonable to require a man to believe that which he does not
   comprehend with at least some clearness. So that advocates of holiness
   should take pains to acquaint themselves with the doctrine. They should
   avail themselves of the help of those who can afford them help. They
   should be able to bring forth a plain text of the Scriptures in
   confirmation of every statement of doctrine which they make.

   But above all other qualifications, holiness teachers need to speak
   under a baptism of the Holy Ghost. They should be divinely inspired.
   Their words should be in demonstration of the Spirit and in power. They
   should present the truth on fire. Without this, little more will be
   done than to convince the understanding. To move men to act, their
   hearts must be touched. Their consciences must be aroused. Argument
   alone will not do this. Noise will not do it. Quietness will not do it.
   The feelings of the speaker must be enlisted and warmed. Fire kindles
   fire. Life begets life. Then go before the people already warmed up,
   specially if you design to say plain, pointed truths, get your heart
   filled with love. Melted ore melts ore. If the people are dead, the
   necessity is all the greater for you to have life, and to have it more
   abundantly. You cannot impart what you do not possess.

   Do you design to attend camp-meetings to help on the work of God?

   Begin at once the needed reparation. Study those passages especially
   which speak of the work of the Spirit. Get thoroughly imbued with the
   idea of the great work the Holy Spirit can accomplish, if it is poured
   out upon the multitude. Read of the many who were pricked in the heart.
   Think of the improbable ones who were converted. The Holy Ghost has
   lost none of His power. He can still disturb Pharisees and awaken
   sinners, and stir up the lukewarm. What is needed to make camp-meetings
   a success, is the outpouring of the Spirit upon the people.

   See how very few ever secure an outpouring of the Spirit on the many!
   When the wonderful results of the day of Pentecost were accomplished,
   there was in the large congregation but a small proportion of
   believers. But they were all filled with the Holy Ghost.

   When duly impressed with the importance of having the Spirit, consider
   to whom it is promised, and on what easy conditions! The ignorant as
   well as the learned may be filled with the Spirit. There is one
   condition for all--obey God.


   "And we are his witnesses of these things: and so is also the Holy
   Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him."--Acts 5:32.

CHAPTER 30

  HOLINESS OPPOSED

   True holiness is not popular. Let one confine himself to that branch of
   holiness which consists in doing good to the bodies of men, and he will
   meet with general acceptance. After he is dead, all will unite to honor
   his name.

   But let one take up another branch of holiness, and seek to do good to
   the souls of men, by conscientiously declaring to them the whole
   counsel of God, and he will not be popular. As a rule, he will be
   persecuted. Christ was persecuted; likewise Paul, so too Luther, John
   Wesley, and Jonathan Edwards also. Any man, at the present day, however
   gentle and prudent he may be, who insists that his hearers, to be
   saved, must forsake pride, and freemasonry, and all popular sins, and
   dress plain, and lead a self-denying life, will meet with opposition
   and persecution. The cross has not lost its reproach. The carnal mind
   has not become friendly to God. Righteousness has not come into
   fellowship with unrighteousness. Light does not enjoy communion with
   darkness, even in this advanced age. John A. Wood says in the Christian
   Standard: "The conviction is pressed upon us, unwelcome as it may be,
   that there is opposition in the Church to Christian holiness, and that
   it to some extent, is on the increase. We had rather believe otherwise;
   but clear light and facts manifest on the subject are painfully
   convincing. We cannot hold our peace and see our Saviour dishonored by
   the guilt and shame of many of His professed friends. To be faithful to
   God and point out the faults of the Church is no evidence of being her
   enemy. He who tells me my faults is my friend.'

   "It is easily seen that in the Church of today there is apathy, and
   more or less hostility, to holiness of heart and life. We know, and
   rejoice, there are many exceptions, but these are far from being
   general. Where there is no open hostility to the subject, there is a
   deep and all-pervading spiritual apathy and indifference regarding it.

   "We ask: Why is this? What are the causes of this state of things? That
   Satan and wicked men should hate and oppose holiness is to be expected;
   but that men and women in the church of God, with baptismal,
   sacramental, and church vows upon them, should be indifferent to it, or
   oppose it, is surprising indeed. But there are causes for it, and one
   is the sad fact that there are many backsliders in the Church, and
   doubtless the same is true in the ministry.

   "The main cause, as we view it, is the low standard of piety in the
   church generally. The degree of piety in many cases requisite for
   admission to the Church, and the amount requisite to sustain a fair
   standing in it, is fearfully small. It does not compare at all
   favorably with the piety of the New Testament, as drawn from its
   precepts or examples. Hence, when the Scripture doctrine of holiness is
   presented, it frequently meets with decided opposition.

   "How much does the common standard in our churches include of
   self-denial, of cross-bearing, of deadness to the world, and of
   agonizing prayer? How much of daily labor for the salvation of souls?
   How much does it demand in the way of entire consecration of all we
   have, all we can do, and how much of our whole being to the cause and
   service of God?

   "New Testament piety demands all these; but it would seem that they
   have largely dropped out of the elements of Christian character, and
   are not requisite now for Christian life. Though these items continue
   in our discipline and church manuals; their spirit and meaning have
   gone, and left only the hollow-sounding names.

   "When holiness, including all these and other essential items, is
   presented with clearness and power, it stirs up opposition. An Eastern
   doctor of divinity said not long since: I find something in me that
   kicks against this sanctification.' Happy would it be for the Church of
   God if he were an exception.

   "This low grade of piety is not Bible piety. The consecration so
   prevalent these days is not Bible consecration. The Bible gives no
   countenance to the idea that a partial consecration of one's self to
   God can be accepted. The Scripture delineation of real godliness gives
   no countenance to the easy, slipshod piety so prevalent. It gives, no
   description of a second-rate piety which the Lord will accept as better
   than none. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot. I
   would thou wert either cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm
   and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.'

   "In all periods of the Church, in modern times, there have been those
   who have tried to elevate the standard of piety to where the New
   Testament puts it, and these have always met a decided, and sometimes a
   bitter, opposition from the Church. Luther, Wesley, Edwards and Finney
   are prominent examples of this. The special advocates of holiness in
   this country--east and west, north and south--need no proof that there
   is opposition to this subject among professing Christians. The little,
   petty innuendoes, sneers, misrepresentations, and ostracism, to which
   they are subject, are all the proof that is necessary.

   "Let any man have his heart filled with Gospel light, love, and power,
   and then, realizing the moral deficiency in the Church, labor directly
   to bring it up to a higher standard of piety, he will soon find a
   decided lack of sympathy, and a tide of opposition in the Church; and
   while he may labor wisely and carry the conviction of the Church with
   him, he will find all the depravity in the Church against him. Human
   depravity is always opposed to holiness."
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 31

  JUSTIFICATION AND ENTIRE SANCTIFICATION DISCRIMINATED

   Writes an intelligent, pious brother: In I Cor. 1:9 Paul wrote To them
   that are sanctified in Christ Jesus.' In succeeding chapters he states
   that there were divisions among them, that they were babes in Christ
   and that he had fed them with milk; and worse still that there was even
   a case of incest among them. Now the argument is this, that he accuses
   these sanctified persons of things that a justified person could not
   do, therefore sanctification is less than justification. Please
   explain."

   We answer--

   1. Paul does not speak of this person of whom he complains as either
   sanctified or justified. What he complains of is that the church
   allowed him a place among them. He commands them to withdraw their
   fellowship at once until the wicked man complained of is brought to
   repentance.


   "But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that
   is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a
   railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one, no not to
   eat."--I Cor 5:11.

   Calling a man a "brother"does not make him a brother in Christ. When
   then, Paul speaks of the church at Corinth as sanctified, he speaks of
   it in its general character, and then points out the exceptions.

   2. Every Christian is sanctified. Before he is converted he sanctifies
   himself; that is, sets himself apart to do God's service, to abandon
   sin and lead a holy life. When converted he is sanctified by the
   Spirit--is really made holy to that degree that he has victory over
   sin. He does not commit sin.


   "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin."--I John 3:9.

   This is a high state of grace. But it is not entire sanctification.

   With the Thessalonians, Paul in his first epistle, finds no fault
   whatever. He speaks of them in terms of the highest commendation. Yet
   he prays for them.


   "And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly."--I Thess. 5:23.

   They were already sanctified in part. He prays that the work may be
   done for them by God--and does not tell them to look for it by a
   process of gradual development and growth. They already had a genuine
   Conversion. They were active, zealous Christians, fit subjects for the
   blessing of holiness.

   These two distinct works of grace are recognized also in the first
   Epistle to the Corinthians. They were converted--sanctified in
   part--babes in Christ. But as there were strifes and divisions among
   them, they were not spiritual--not sanctified wholly--but carnal, and
   walked as men. (I Cor. 3:1, 3.)

   The same idea is also expressed in Titus 3:5, 6: "Not by works of
   righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved
   us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost which
   he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour." Here we
   have--1. The work of conversion expressed by "the washing of
   regeneration." 2. Of entire sanctification expressed by the "renewing
   of the Holy Ghost."

   So also in II Peter 1:4: "Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and
   precious promises; that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
   nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through
   lust." Here is--1. Conversion--"having escaped the corruption," and 2.
   Entire sanctification--"partakers of the divine nature."

   These two works are distinctly referred to in the Old as well as in the
   New Testament. Some get into perplexity by confounding sanctification
   with entire sanctification. We should be careful and not do it. By
   using Scriptural language in its proper connection, we avoid confusion
   and help to promulgate sound doctrine.

   By seeking entire sanctification as a distinct blessing obtainable by
   faith we get it clear and definite, to the satisfying of the soul;
   while those who think they obtained all at conversion that God can give
   them, generally either go back, or go on in a manner unsatisfactory
   even to themselves. They very rarely can testify that the blood of
   Jesus Christ cleanses them from all sin. Their experience and their
   language are indefinite. But let them make a definite consecration, and
   pray definitely to be sanctified wholly, and the work will be done.

   These are not so far apart as many imagine. They bear about the same
   relation to each other, that a weed cut off, does to a weed pulled up
   by the roots. The one may be compared to a piece of land just cleared
   off with the stumps still remaining, the other to a field from which
   every root has been extracted. Both bear fruit of an equally good
   quality, but the latter is more easily cultivated, and yields the more
   abundant harvest. The justified soul does not commit sin, but he feels
   sin still remaining, against which he is compelled to fight that he may
   retain the mastery. The sanctified soul is delivered from all evil
   tempers--no wrong temper--none contrary to love remains in the soul.
   All his thoughts, words and actions are governed by pure love. The
   temptations of the sanctified,--for they are often most fiercely
   assailed,--are of external origin. A skillful general desires most the
   destruction of those forces that can harm him most. Satan is an able
   and artful warrior. He lays his deepest plots, and exerts his mightiest
   energies for the overthrow of those who are seeking to follow the Lord
   fully, knowing that through them his kingdom suffers its greatest
   losses. If any one in probation supposes himself beyond the reach of
   temptations, he is either already within the grasp of Satan, or he is
   most woefully deceived. But he whose "life is hid with Christ in God,"
   feels secure, though Satan rages. The merely justified has to meet, not
   only the onsets of Satan, but is compelled to struggle against the
   remaining corruptions of his own heart. The one has both a civil and
   foreign war to carry on at once; the other has a foreign war alone.
   Beloved, hasten to the fountain that is opened for sin and uncleanness.
   This is the will of God, even your sanctification. Give yourself no
   rest until you know and feel that the blood of Jesus cleanses you from
   all sin.

   Holiness, Entire Sanctification and Perfect Love are different Bible
   terms used to denote essentially the same state of grace. The same
   building may be called a house, a residence or a home. Each has its
   different shade of meaning. But whatever term is used to designate a
   state of conformity to the will of God, it must not be lost sight of
   for a single moment, that love constitutes an important element. Christ
   says,


   "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that
   hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute
   you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in
   heaven."--Matt. 5:44-45.

   If one professes to be wholly sanctified to God, and manifests
   continually towards those who do not indorse him a malignant spirit
   that loses no opportunity to wound them with tongue or pen, we must not
   receive his profession. Weighed in the balance of God's sanctuary he is
   found wanting.

   But Perfect Love never gives its countenance to sin in any shape or
   guise. It loves the sinner, but it hates sin. It reproves it whenever
   found. It is not spared because it is fashionable or profitable. True
   holiness is not wanting in any of its parts. It does not "tithe mint
   and anise and cummin," and neglect weightier matters.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 32

  PERFECTION

   There is no prejudice against the use of the word perfection in
   connection with human affairs generally. Who objects to a tailor who
   makes a perfect fit for his customers? If, in a piece of cloth
   purchased, an imperfection is found, it is promptly returned; if, in a
   tool a flaw is discovered, it is replaced by a better one. The doctor
   does not suffer in reputation by effecting perfect cures; nor does the
   lawyer in making for his client a perfect defense. Why should any who
   claim to be Christians be intolerant of the use of the word perfection
   in connection with Christian character? Why should they deem it almost
   blasphemy for one who was on the point of spiritual death, to affirm
   that Christ has affected for him a perfect cure?

   Instead of the Scriptures forbidding us to be perfect, as might be
   inferred from the teachings of some ministers and churches, they
   expressly command it.


   "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
   perfect."--Matt. 5:48.

   The phrase "even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect," does
   not denote the degree to which we are to be perfect, but the reason why
   we should be perfect. Be perfect servants of a perfect God.


   "I am the Almighty God: walk before me and be thou perfect."--Gen.
   17:1.

   The Apostle Paul tells us that his object, in preaching Christ was, not
   to encourage men to believe that if they called themselves Christians
   they would of necessity be saved, not to build up a society, but to
   produce in each of these a perfect Christian character.


   "Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all
   wisdom: that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus."--Col.
   1:28.

   For this same purpose the truths of the Bible were revealed to man.


   "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness
   that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
   works."--II Tim. 3:16, 17.

   What shall we do with these plain passages of the Word of God? Of
   course they can be explained away to the satisfaction of worldlings and
   cavilers in the churches. So can any other texts that teach doctrines,
   or enjoin prohibitions or precepts repugnant to the sensual, worldly
   spirit of the age. This is done to a fearful extent. The cross is
   wreathed with flowers, and instead of being the symbol of the maligned,
   despised, persecuted religion of the man of Nazareth, it has become the
   symbol of baptized worldliness and a refined sensualism and fashionable
   sentimentality. The religion which takes the Bible for its basis, but
   claims the right to eliminate from its teachings whatever is
   distasteful to the "culture"of the day, is not the Christianity of the
   New Testament. It may adopt its forms, use its language and claim to be
   its representative, but it is all a delusion and a sham. There is not
   in it the one essential of true religion--submission to God. Stress is
   laid upon what it is fashionable to observe.

   We have no right to reject the words of the Bible or the ideas which
   they represent and still claim to be Christians.

   The word "perfect"is, then, a New Testament term with a well defined
   meaning. We must accept the word in its Scripture meaning, and neither
   reject it nor explain it away.

   The command "be perfect," does not express any well known, definite act
   like the command "repent;" nor any particular experience like being
   "born again." It is taken in a wider sense; with a greater latitude of
   meaning. It applies to a child of God in various stages of his
   experience. A blade of corn may be said to be perfect in a dozen
   different stages of its growth. But if, before it was ripe, it stopped
   growing, it would not be perfect. So, at a certain period of his
   experience, a person may be said to be a perfect Christian, and yet his
   attainments in piety be small in comparison with what they are after
   years of toil and sorrow.

   A young man leaves the district school for the academy. He has studied
   hard and begins to reap some of its fruits. The teacher, proud of his
   pupil, says: "He is perfect in his mathematics. He can solve every
   problem in the hardest arithmetic." After three years in the academy
   with a lesson every day in mathematics, he is sent to college,
   recommended as "perfect in mathematics." He is well versed in algebra,
   geometry and trigonometry. After studying mathematics in college four
   years, having completed his course, he graduates with the highest
   honors of the mathematical department. He then goes to some special
   school and spends perhaps three years more in studying mathematics as
   applied to astronomy or to civil engineering. Then again he is
   pronounced perfect in his well-mastered study. At the close of a life
   of unremitting study, we hear him say with the immortal Sir Isaac
   Newton, "I seem like a child standing upon the shore of the ocean
   gathering pebbles. I have picked up here and there a pearl, while the
   great ocean of truth lies unexplored before me." So when one becomes a
   Christian his conversion may be perfect; when his heart is purified by
   faith he may be perfectly sanctified; and still after years of growth
   in grace we hear him saying with Job when he got a sight of God,
   "Wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes." Yet God had
   twice pronounced him perfect.

   Hence the Apostle says of himself,


   "Not as though I had already attained, either were already
   perfect."--Phil. 3:12.

   Yet almost in the same breath he says, "Let us therefore as many as be
   perfect." This implies that he counted himself among those that are
   perfect.

   We never read in the Bible of any being made perfect by faith. [1]
   Quite another element enters into the making of the saints perfect.
   "For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all
   things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their
   salvation perfect through sufferings."--Heb. 2:10. The perfection which
   the Gospel enjoins upon the saints can only be attained by fidelity in
   doing and patience in suffering all the will of God. A symmetrical,
   well-balanced, unswerving Christian character is not obtained at once.
   When Paul, and Barnabas would "confirm the souls of the disciples,"
   they did it by


   "exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much
   tribulation enter into the kingdom of God."--Acts 14:22.

   We must not confound the perfection which the Gospel requires with
   perfect love or entire sanctification. The Scriptures do not use these
   terms as synonymous.

   We are not to seek Christian perfection so much by praying for it as a
   blessing to be received in an instant by faith, as by "patient
   continuance in well-doing" We are to seek it as a well disposed boy
   seeks a vigorous manhood by shunning the vices and overcoming the
   temptations to which he is exposed, and by doing faithfully the duties
   to which he is called.

   We must not conclude that we shall by any natural process grow out

   of our imperfections and become perfect Christians, without any special
   effort in that direction. Grace, in every stage and in every degree, is
   from God. The prayer of Peter for the saints is, "But the God of all
   grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after
   that ye have suffered awhile, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen,
   settle you."--I Pet. 5:10.

   The Apostle gives a good example of the way to profess perfection:


   "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but
   I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am
   apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not myself to have
   apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are
   behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press
   toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
   Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded."--Phil.
   3:12-15.

   The Bible teaches us that we are to render a perfect service to God.
   Nothing short of this will meet our obligations.


   "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
   perfect."--Matt. 5:48.

   This is a plain command. But many err in supposing that this perfection
   is one of knowledge or of judgment. It is no such thing. In this sense
   God only is perfect. The perfection which God requires is a perfection
   of love.

   In many things we are necessarily imperfect, and always shall be. But,
   by the grace of God, we may become perfect in love. Our capacity for
   this kind of perfection does not depend upon our talents or our
   circumstances. He who has but one dollar can give all the money he has,
   just as well as he who has a million. I can love God with all my heart;
   an angel can love God no more than with all his heart. The requirements
   of God are reasonable. They cover only what we are, or what we are
   capable, by His help, of becoming. Whatever our defects, we may have
   the


   "love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto
   us."--Rom. 5:5.

   When this is the case--when we love God with all the heart, mind and
   strength, and our neighbor as ourselves--then have we perfect love. Not
   that it is incapable of increase. As our capacities enlarge, our love
   will increase, but as we now are we can do no better; and it is
   accepted according to what a man hath, and not according to what he
   hath not. If we have this perfect love to God, it will be
   manifested--not in words only, but in actions.

   We shall keep His commandments. Our study will be to know His will,
   with an honest intention of doing it, with whatever losses or crosses
   it may be attended. We shall ask, What does God require?--not what is
   pleasing to self or popular with the world.

   We shall manifest our love to God, by acts of kindness, just as far as
   we have the opportunity, to all of His creatures. We shall take the
   greatest delight in those who love Him most.


   "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar; for he
   that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom
   he hath not seen?"--I John 4:20.

   This is emphatic. It shows that our professions of love to God amount
   to absolutely nothing, unless we love our fellow-men especially those
   who are striving to keep His commandments. The charity that Paul speaks
   of in the thirteenth chapter of first Corinthians, without which the
   strongest faith and the largest faith and the largest gifts, and even
   martyrdom for the truth, will profit us nothing, manifests itself in
   tender feelings and kind conduct towards our fellow-men.

   Do not profess perfect love, if you are cross, unamiable, and unkind at
   home. If you have not natural affection, you certainly have not
   supernatural. If you do not do as well as the brutes, do not profess to
   be like the angels of God. If you are not kind to her whom you have
   sworn to cherish, or to those whose protector nature has constituted
   you, stop your professions at once. You have already sins enough to
   sink you to hell, without adding hypocrisy to them.

   If you cannot treat your brother, whose opinion may not always coincide
   with yours, as civilly as men of the world treat each other, do not
   profess perfect love. It does not require any grace to love those who
   agree with our opinions, and who yield in willing deference to our
   authority. Common sinners do as well as that.

   If you are injuring your brother's influence by unkind words and
   injurious insinuations, do not profess perfect love. Remember that


   "Love worketh no ill to his neighbor."--Rom. 13:10.

   Therefore if you are doing him harm by talking against him when at the
   same time you say that you love him, you show that at the best, you are
   self-deceived. You are mistaken in your profession. You do not enjoy
   that state of grace that you think you do. A little candid reflection
   would convince you of this. There is always a care for the reputation
   of those that we tenderly love.


   "If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected
   in us."--I John 4:12

   [Transcriber Note: Without desiring to be hypercritical of this fine
   book or of its author, I make this observation: B. T. Roberts' teaching
   on the subject of perfection, in this article, seems to be somewhat
   muddled, especially in this and several following paragraphs. He
   doubtless believed that "Perfect Love" was received by faith. However,
   in this article he does not clearly distinguish the perfection of love
   from the "perfection of maturity" received by perseverance and growth,
   or from the "perfection of the body" which shall be received by the
   saints at the resurrection of the just.--DVM]

   never once a person being made perfect by faith.

CHAPTER 33

  DEAD TO SIN

   That many who profess the blessing of entire sanctification are greatly
   lacking in some of its essential elements is painfully evident. They
   are not "blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke." They
   do not "shine as lights in the world." Not that one can reach on earth
   such a state that those who are disposed to find fault with him can not
   do it. This is impossible. Our Saviour was perpetually found fault with
   by the most noted religionists of His day, and at last put to death by
   them. But we may get where we have the constant approbation of
   God;--where we please Him in all that we do, and in all that we say.
   Our lives may be in harmony with His word taken in its plain, evident
   meaning.

   1. Some have not the courage to bear a faithful testimony for God and
   His truth. They speak against sin in the general, but they are careful
   not to attack, in a determined manner, popular sins. They pass them
   over in a way not calculated to attract attention. Where it is
   fashionable for professing Christians to dress like the world they have
   nothing to say against it. If the preacher's salary is raised by
   renting the pews, they let it pass in silence, though the Bible plainly
   forbids it. If men prominent in the Church belong to secret, oath-bound
   societies they do not try to convince them that this stands in the way
   of their salvation. In short, they shun to declare the whole counsel of
   God. They tell many truths. But they are not thorough. The work they do
   is superficial. If they are themselves saved at last, it will be, as by
   fire.

   2. Some evidently have not the love that is essential to salvation.
   They abuse, in no stinted manner, those who do not give them the
   endorsement they want. When things go contrary they behave very much as
   men of the world do when they are downright mad; yet they insist upon
   it that their bitter denunciations and personal invectives are prompted
   by love. They seem to forget that "love worketh no ill to his
   neighbor." Towards those who favor them, but give no other evidence of
   superior piety, they are kind and complacent.

   3. Others are self-willed. They seem consecrated, but it appears to be
   to have their own way. They make it a point of conscience to have every
   one come to their terms and submit to their conditions. They are bold
   and courageous, in defense of their own opinions and actions. They make
   the way to heaven so narrow that it seems almost impossible for any one
   to travel in it. After getting those who oppose them out of the church,
   if they can, they generally end with either joining the formal,
   fashionable church which they have specially denounced; or they become
   a sect in themselves.

   The trouble in these and similar cases is, there is an effort to get
   that sanctified to God, which is not capable of being thoroughly and
   permanently sanctified--the old nature. The Apostle says:


   "Put off . . . the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful
   lusts."--Eph. 4:22.

   The modern interpretation is, "Sanctify him." So he makes an effort to
   get sanctified, and professes that it is done. But he will not stay
   sanctified. It is like putting a thin coating of silver on an iron
   spoon. A little wear brings the base material to the surface. A few
   knocks, and the old nature is apparent. The coating here and there
   comes off and he presents the appearance of being sanctified in spots.

   There is an experience which will enable us to stand true to God, and
   true to our own convictions everywhere. Job had it. Paul lived in this
   state till death. God's true saints have had it in all ages. Paul tells
   us in his own experience how it is obtained.


   "I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
   liveth in me."--Gal. 2:20.

   Crucifixion was a lingering death. It was not sudden, like
   decapitation. The victim might linger in agony for days. So, one does
   not die out to the world all at once. The struggle between the life of
   self and death to self, the world, and sin may go on for a long time.
   But the sooner it is ended the better. The sudden piercing of the
   spear, though it may look cruel, is really an act of mercy. Anything
   that keeps the old nature alive but protracts the misery and postpones
   the triumph. For after death cometh the resurrection life.

   Crucifixion was a death inflicted by others. The victim was simply
   passive. Others nailed him to the cross--others planted the cross in
   its place. Many fail to go forward in their experience because they
   lose sight of this truth. They do not accept the ill treatment that
   they receive because of their fidelity to Christ, as a part of their
   necessary discipline. They blame those who inflict it. Resentment takes
   the place of submission. They give blow for blow. When reviled they pay
   it back as best they can. If led to the slaughter they make desperate
   and successful efforts to escape. They will not consent to be nailed to
   the cross. Their whole life is a life of self. They may be very
   zealous, but it is the zeal of John and not of Paul. They spare no
   pains to herald their devotion to Christ. "Come and see my zeal for the
   Lord of hosts." They may be exceedingly plain and outspoken, and
   uncompromising; but they are simply acting out their natural
   disposition, modified and restrained somewhat by grace. It is a great
   opportunity for growing in grace and becoming strong for God that we
   miss, when we refuse to suffer patiently the wrongs inflicted upon us,
   it may be, by those who ought to stand by us. Diamonds are found in
   beds of gravel. The worthless clay becomes fitted for the walls of a
   palace by becoming molded into shape and passing through the fire. The
   passionate, the proud, the self-willed, the worldly, may be fitted for
   a heaven of purity by consenting to die unto sin and unto the world.
   All they have to do is, to get and to keep the consent of their wills;
   the cross will be duly prepared. Let them quietly submit, the work will
   be done. More submission would make greater saints. We fail to get a
   solid experience because we will not hold still and suffer the
   crucifixion to go on and become completed. We do not reap the result
   desired because we will not accept the process. Our claim to having
   faith in God is worthless, so long as we refuse to have confidence in
   His mode of working. Faith in God is faith in His providence as well as
   in His word. It believes in what He does, as well as in what He says.
   Job saw the hand of God in making him poor, as well as in making him
   rich.


   "The Lord gave; and the Lord hath taken away: blessed be the name of
   the Lord."--Job 1:21.

   He blessed the Lord in his affliction, and the Lord blessed him out of
   his affliction. His latter state was better than his first.

   The only way to life is through the valley of the shadow of death. The
   worm weaves its shroud to get its wings. It dies to the earth that it
   may live in the air. After the crucifixion of self comes the
   resurrection to life. As the old nature dies we are transformed into
   the divine nature. The change is real, and may be permanent. The whole
   being is changed. The intellect is stronger and more active. Truth is
   comprehended and retained more easily than before. The conscience is
   corrected, and invested with sovereign authority over the entire man.
   Truth is loved and sought after and embraced. There is a keen
   sensitiveness to right and wrong. The side of right may have but few
   adherents, and they despised; but it can never be so unpopular that it
   is not, when seen, espoused and defended.

   The body appetites undergo a great transformation. Those that are
   unnatural are removed. Those that are natural and right within proper
   limits are subdued and brought into subjection to reason and
   conscience. The reins of government have passed from the carnal to the
   spiritual. He is still in the body, but not in the flesh. The flesh no
   longer dominates and controls. A blessed harmony prevails throughout
   his entire being. One thus saved is no longer at war with himself. The
   rebel is dead. The "I"that made trouble is crucified. It no longer
   lives. Christ has taken possession. He sits upon the throne of the
   affections. The words and actions prompted by His Spirit are in harmony
   with His teachings,


   "It is a faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall also
   live with him: If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny
   him he also will deny us."--II Tim. 2:11,12.

CHAPTER 34

  ROOTS OF BITTERNESS

   It is a great thing to get saved;--it is much greater to keep saved.
   Many lose communion with God by compromising with sin--many more by
   losing their love and becoming harsh and uncharitable. In the same
   breath in which we are commanded to "follow holiness without which no
   man shall see the Lord" we are charged to look


   "diligently, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and
   thereby many be defiled."--Heb. 12:15.

   These "roots of bitterness" are troublesome things. What trouble they
   make in the Conference, and in the Church, especially if there is a
   strong, leading spirit nourished by the root. There is almost no end to
   the mischief it can make. It brings in a spirit of division, it
   instigates to church trials, it stirs up a hasty spirit it breaks up
   societies and ruins souls. As alcohol, the bane of our race, is
   extracted from grain from which the bread of our race is made, so this
   "root of bitterness" is a perversion of holiness without which no one
   can be saved. To discern it one must look diligently. Much that passes
   for the fruit of holiness grows upon this root of bitterness. It
   produces many sermons, and exhortations, and articles for the papers
   which claim to be inspired by the Holy Spirit. From knowing that what
   goes into a building is suitable for food you cannot decide that what
   comes out is good to nourish human beings. The grain may come out flour
   for bread; or it may come out liquid hell-fire. It depends upon whether
   there is a mill or a still inside. So what one gets out of a text
   depends upon what there is in the heart. If there is love, the severest
   words will be seasoned with tenderness. They may be sharper than a
   two-edged sword; but, to the honest soul that is wounded, there comes
   the oil of joy for mourning.

   But if, instead of love within there is the root of bitterness the
   words will drive rather than draw; the arrow may be well aimed; but it
   will leave a poisoned wound which refuses to be healed. Those who come
   under the influence of this root of bitterness become less kind, less
   amiable, than they were before they professed holiness. Those who live
   in love may stir up enmity, but their enemies are drawn to them in
   spite of themselves.

   It is not enough that we are zealous, and our zeal is successful in
   making converts. What is the character of our converts? Are they filled
   with that love of God which leads them to keep His commandments?


   "For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments: and his
   commandments are not grievous."--1 John 5:3.

   Or, on the contrary, are they conformed to this world? If not, if they
   are simple and plain, are they bitter in their spirit and denunciatory
   in their tone?

   Christ said of the Pharisees,


   "Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye
   make him two-fold more the child of hell than yourselves."--Matt.
   23:15.

   We must see to it that we are not of that sort, and that our converts
   are not of that sort. Zeal and success in making converts and in
   getting them into the church are not evidence that those who have the
   zeal and meet with the success are children of God. Both those who lead
   and those who follow may be blind. The church and the world greatly
   need those who can and will do true work for God. Many who seem willing
   to do it are not in a spiritual condition to do it. They are either too
   complaisant or too bitter. Their converts are either baptized
   worldlings or self-complacent bigots.

   Who will have true charity and will do faithful work for God?
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER 35

  BE YE HOLY

   No matter how brilliant a beginning one may make in the divine life, if
   he does not learn to act from a sense of his obligations to God, his
   religious career will, in all probability be a short one. A road all
   the way down hill is not generally long. Good impulses are often of
   only short duration. When Lord Nelson, the greatest of England's naval
   heroes, opened battle upon the combined fleet of France and Spain, a
   fleet nearly double the size of his own, he nailed at his mast head the
   signal, "England expects every man to do his duty." If veterans in the
   excitement of battle need the inspiration which a sense of duty only
   can impart, much more do Christians in the conflicts which come upon
   them in the midst of depression and discouragement. Our course, as
   followers of Jesus, should be determined by what we ought to do, and
   not by what we feel like doing. We must, then, pay the highest respect
   to the commands of God. Let us consider one of these commands.


   "But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner
   of conversation."--I Pet. 1:15.

   This is not an isolated command. It is found in varied forms in every
   portion of the Bible. It stands out prominently in every dispensation.
   Some of the early patriarchs furnish bright examples of obedience to
   its requirements. "Enoch walked with God" so closely that he was taken
   up bodily to the abode of the blessed without ever tasting death. Job
   demonstrated to the world that it is possible for a man to keep
   holiness, though he loses everything else. Daniel proved that a man can
   live a holy life in the courts of kings, surrounded by every temptation
   that pleasure and ambition can furnish. No command of the Bible is
   stated more clearly, and few more frequently, than the requirement to
   be holy.

   It is an important command. Viewed in whatever light it may be, it is
   one of the most weighty of all the requirements which God has made of
   man. Obedience to it is crowned with the greatest blessings God can
   bestow, disobedience to it makes the transgressor wretched for time and
   for eternity.

   You who have been accustomed to look upon holiness as simply a
   privilege which can be neglected with impunity; be convinced of your
   mistake. If you neglect it, you neglect it at no less a peril than the
   loss of Heaven.


   "And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth,
   neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which
   are written in the Lamb's book of life."--Rev. 21:27. "Follow peace
   with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the
   Lord."--Heb. 12:14.

   These are plain statements. The whole Bible is in harmony with them. No
   contradictory teaching can be found between its hallowed pages. Let us
   examine briefly a few of the features of this command.

   1. It requires a holy nature. It calls upon us to be holy. It demands
   nothing less than a complete renovation of our moral natures. For this,
   the Gospel has made the most ample provision. The avowed object of
   Christ's coming was that,


   "We, being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, might serve him
   without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of
   our life."--Luke 1:74, 75.

   Our sins are our greatest and most dangerous enemies. The angel who
   announced the coming of Christ said,


   "Thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from
   their sins."--Matt. 1:21.

   Then ask the Lord, for Christ's sake, to save you from all your sins,
   and make you holy. All admit that he can save from the greater and
   grosser sins--from murder and theft and profanity. Why can He not then
   save from the more subtle and refined sins, from envy and pride and
   discontent? What reason is there that He cannot? What text of Scripture
   is it which goes to prove that Christ cannot save from every sin, to
   which man is subject, those who obey Him? When God makes a requirement,
   He gives the ability to meet it. The two go together. He is not a hard
   master. He does not attempt to reap where He has not sown.

   All that is said about the natural weakness and depravity of our
   natures is true. But the Gospel proposes to make us new creatures. So
   the bare fact that God commands us to be holy is proof conclusive that
   He has made ample provision for us to be holy. Exceeding great and
   precious promises are given, on purpose that we may avail ourselves of
   them, and thus become "partakers of the divine nature "--that is,
   become holy. (II Pet. 1:4.)

   The command we are considering requires us to be holy in our whole
   manner of living. Our holiness must be not only experimental but
   practical. It must manifest itself in all the ordinary affairs of life.
   The word "conversation" is one of the few words which have changed
   their meaning since King James' translation of the Bible was made.
   Then, it meant one's general conduct, or behavior. Now, we restrict its
   meaning to familiar discourse with each other by word of mouth. In both
   senses God requires us to be holy.

   Our language must be on all occasions chaste and pure. Here is a
   general rule for all Christians:


   "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which
   is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the
   hearers."-- Eph. 4:29.

   A holy heart employs a holy tongue He is deceived who thinks his heart
   is holy while his conversation is unholy. The state of the heart
   determines the character of the language. Corrupt communication
   proceeds from a corrupt heart.

   If we are holy in conversation we shall be careful not to say anything
   to the injury of anyone, unless the law of love requires it, in order
   to prevent him from injuring others. He that shall dwell in God's holy
   hill


   "backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor
   taketh up a reproach against his neighbor." Ps. 15:3.

   A holiness that does not save from evil speaking is of little worth. As
   a rule, if you cannot say something good of the absent, then say
   nothing at all. When tempted to cast some reflections upon those who
   are not where they can explain what is calculated to lower them in the
   estimation of others, then resist the temptation and find something
   good to say of them and you will find a blessing to your soul.

   The holiness required must manifest itself in all our business matters.
   It demands the strictest honesty; but it goes beyond that. Men who
   borrow money through the influence of representations which they know
   are not strictly true, should not make any profession of holiness, nor
   even of justifying grace. A religion devoid of honesty is utterly
   worthless. No pains should be taken to keep it; for it is not worth
   keeping. We must exercise a good conscience in every business
   transaction with which we are connected. The directions which Paul
   gives to Christian servants, if carried out, would make their services
   in good demand by all who have need of service.


   "Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the
   flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, us unto
   Christ; not with eye-service, as menpleasers: but as the servants of
   Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing
   service, as to the Lord, and not to men. Knowing that whatsoever good
   thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he
   be bond or free."--Eph. 6:58.

   There are two remarkable things in this passage. What we do for others
   conscientiously, those for whom we do it stand to us in the place of
   Christ. That for service thus rendered God will reward us.

   This is the holiness that God requires of us. It must be professed by
   word of mouth. It must manifest itself in our love for the saints, in
   our love for the Bible and for communion with God in prayer. It must
   take on the most thoroughly practical character before the world, and
   show its influence in the bargains we make, in the fidelity with which
   we discharge every trust committed to us, in the dress we wear, in the
   manner in which we walk and talk in our families and in the various
   relations of life. It will carry an element of sincerity and honesty
   into the smallest, as well as into the largest transactions of life.
   "Is this right?" will be a question that will come up repeatedly before
   the mind; and if the answer is in the negative, no matter what pleasure
   or profit the proposed action may promise, it goes no farther.

   One who is thus holy will be persecuted,--there is no help for
   that--but he will be respected.


   "For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and
   approved of men." Rom. 14:18.

   Beloveds, do not say that you cannot be thus holy. If there were not a
   single promise in the Bible that God would make you holy, the very fact
   that He commands it, is, in itself, the best promise that He will
   bestow all the grace needed to those who seek it. Then, from this
   moment begin to seek holiness. Every gain that you make inwardly,
   manifest it; outwardly. Let those around you profit by every blessing
   that God sends upon your soul. Prove to the world, by leading a holy
   life, that the doctrine of holiness is true.

   No arguments of geologists can raise the price of real estate in any
   section of country so rapidly as can a well sending up its hundreds of
   barrels of oil a day. Scripture proofs of the doctrine of holiness
   cannot convince the people that it is attainable so unanswerably as a
   holy life. Then, do not be sinning and repenting any longer. Consecrate
   your life to Him, not only in general but in the detail. Live wholly
   for Him. "Be ye holy in all manner of living."

CHAPTER 36

  ARE YOU HOLY?

   Do not evade the question. Press it home upon your conscience. Ponder
   it well. Keep it in your mind until an honest and correct conclusion is
   reached. You readily admit that there would be reason for uneasiness
   were you justly in doubt as to whether or not you were converted. The
   obligation to be converted is no stronger than the obligation to be
   holy. Both rest on the same foundation--the command of God. This is no
   less explicit in the one case than in the other. Why should we be born
   of the Spirit? The ready answer is, Jesus says, "Ye must be born
   again." Why ought we to be holy? The same Divine Teacher declares,
   "This is the will of God, even your sanctification." Is the one
   essential to salvation? The infallible Guide, who says, "Except ye be
   converted and become as little children, ye can in no case enter into
   the kingdom of heaven," says also, "Without holiness no man shall see
   the Lord." If you are indifferent as to your personal sanctity, you
   have reason to doubt the genuineness of your conversion. Truly
   regenerated souls aspire after holiness. Even where the system of
   theology in which they have been educated denies its attainableness,
   they still long for it as something desirable. With the pious Watts,
   they exclaim:

   "Could we but climb where Moses stood, And view the landscape o'er. Not
   Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood, Could fright us from that
   shore."

   This is the language of a converted soul. "Could we but climb," how
   gladly would we do it. Were we satisfied that it is within the reach of
   possibility, we would make a desperate effort. Well, earnest Christian,
   you may ascend, even here, to Pisgah's summit. You may dwell in the
   land of Beulah, where the sun always shines. Holiness is possible.
   Consider. Would you impose upon your tender child of ten years of age,
   a load which would require the utmost strength of a full grown man to
   carry? Would you require your son, so far recovered from a protracted
   sickness, as to be able to sit up an hour at a time, to do a day's work
   that none but an able-bodied man could accomplish? "If ye then being
   evil," would not require impossibilities, how much less would "your
   Father in heaven?" God commands us, "Be ye holy." Pharaoh may demand
   the full tale of brick without furnishing material; but God never
   imposes a duty without providing every needed help for its fulfillment.
   Were we obliged to obtain a holy heart by our own efforts, we might
   despair. If we were "to grow up," into holiness by habits of obedience,
   discouragement might take place. But a holy heart is as much the work
   of God as a conversion. The Word says,


   "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our
   sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."--I John 1:9.

   Who forgives sin? God only. Who cleanses us from all unrighteousness?
   The same Almighty Being. None, then, need despair. Do not limit the
   Holy One of Israel. If you meet the conditions, God will make even you
   holy. If holiness be God's work, try ever so long and earnestly, and
   you cannot grow up into it. Ask Him now to "sprinkle clean water upon
   you, and ye shall be clean;" to put His Spirit within you, and to cause
   you to walk in His statutes. As Dr. Adam Clarke says: "In no part of
   the Scriptures are we directed to seek holiness gradatim (that is, step
   by step, gradually). We are to come to God as well for an instantaneous
   and complete purification from all sin as for an instantaneous pardon.

   Neither the seriatim pardon nor the gradatim purification exists in the
   Bible." It is when the soul is purified from all sin that it can
   properly grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
   Christ!--as the field may be expected to produce a good crop, and all
   the seed vegetate, when the thorns, thistles, and briars, and noxious
   weeds of every kind are grubbed out of it. Come to God, then, in faith
   to make you holy; and soon exulting, you will sing:

   "Rejoicing now in earnest hope I stand, and from the mountain top see
   all the land below."

CHAPTER 37

  THE CARNAL MIND

   When our Saviour was teaching Nicodemus the nature of the new birth,
   the latter inquired "How can these things be?" The Saviour did not
   attempt to explain the how. He insisted upon the fact; He made no
   effort to remove the mystery of the manner. To endeavor to do it would
   be as unsatisfactory as to try to show where the wind comes from and
   where it goes to. Those who receive it must receive it by faith.


   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and testify
   that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness."--John 3:11.

   Those who know least about how food builds up the body, often have the
   keenest appetites, and the best blood. So those who are least
   inquisitive about the manner in which the Holy Spirit operates upon the
   mind to sanctify it, often have the greatest degree of the Spirit's
   influence upon their hearts. He who receives the kingdom of God
   receives it, not as a philosopher after all his questions have been
   answered and his doubts removed, but as a little child, who takes it on
   trust, and asks no questions.


   "Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God
   as a little child shall in no wise enter therein."--Luke 18:17.

   Speculations in religious things easily become perplexing and
   unprofitable. Those who make a hobby of talking and writing about the
   "carnal mind" are in danger of running to an extreme that is not
   Scriptural.

   There are seven different Greek words which, in the New Testament, are
   translated "mind."

   1. "gnome"--purpose, judgment.


   "But without thy mind would I do nothing."--Philemon, 14. "These have
   one mind."--Rev. 17:13. "He purposed [literally it was his purpose] to
   return."--Acts 20:3. "Yet I give my judgment."--I Cor. 7:25, etc.

   2. "ennoia,"--inner purpose.


   "Arm yourselves likewise with the same mind."--I Pet. 4:1.

   3. "nous,"--mind, understanding.


   "God gave them over to a reprobate mind."--Rom. 1:28. "But I see
   another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind."--Rom.
   7:23. "Then opened he their understanding."--Luke 24:45. "I will pray
   with the understanding also."--I Cor. 14:15.

   4. "psuche,"--soul, affections.


   "Made their minds evil affected."--Acts 14:2. "With one mind striving
   together."--Philippians 1:27. "Take no thought for your life."--Matt.
   6:25. "But are not able to kill the soul."--Matt. 10:28.

   5. "noema,"--mind, thought.


   "Their minds were blinded."--II Cor. 3:14. "Shall keep your hearts and
   minds."--Phil. 4:7. "We are not ignorant of his devices."--II Cor.
   2:11. "Bringing into captivity every thought."--II Cor. 10:5

   6. "dianoia,"--mind, intellect.


   "With all thy soul, and with all thy mind."--Matt. 22:37. "I will put
   my laws into their mind."--Heb. 8:10. "Having the understanding
   darkened."--Eph. 4:18. "Hath given us an understanding."--John 5:20.
   "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God."--Rom. 8:7. "Knoweth
   what (is) the mind of the Spirit." Rom. 8:27. "To be carnally minded is
   death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace."--Rom. 8:6.

   These are all the passages in which the last word is found in the New
   Testament. It means "what one has in mind, what one thinks, feels,
   wills."

   A man has but one mind, one intellect, one soul. He may have many
   thoughts, inclinations and purposes. If he is in his natural state,
   unrenewed by the grace of God, his mind taken in with worldly thoughts,
   and plans, and purposes, he is carnally minded,--in a state of
   spiritual death. If he has been truly converted to God, his mind is
   taken up with spiritual things. Whatever may engage his attention for
   the time, God is never lost sigh of in all his plans and purposes. The
   bent of his mind is toward God. He is "not in the flesh, but in the
   Spirit," for "the Spirit of God dwells in him." But if, while he is
   devoted to Christ on the whole, he, at the same time, is partisan in
   his spirit, and attaches himself to some leading man, so as to follow
   his dictation, he is in a measure carnal, though still a babe in
   Christ.


   "And I, brethren. could not speak unto you us unto spiritual, but as
   unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ." "For ye are yet carnal: for
   whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye
   not carnal, and walk as men?"--I Cor. 3:1, 3.

   But as they were not wholly given up to this spirit of strife and
   division, they had not yet reached the state of being carnally
   minded--that is, a state of death, though they were on their way to it.

   If one is sanctified wholly, his mind, his will, is so changed that
   earthly things lose their attractions, and he sets his affections on
   things above, and not on things on the earth. Such persons follow the
   Lord fully. But their minds are not destroyed. The "carnal mind" is
   never so destroyed as to do away with the freedom of the will. There is
   need to constantly watch and pray. Things that may be lawful in
   themselves may be easily run to sinful excess: The love that begins in
   the Spirit may end in the flesh. Eating "their meat with gladness" may
   degenerate into a desire for luxuries. "Diligence in business" may
   easily run into a love of the world. Even a fixed determination "to
   follow the Lord fully" may unconsciously slide into a consecration to
   one's own will, so that those will be fellowshipped who indorse us and
   our methods, and those who do not will he unChristianized.

   The Sun of Righteousness may shine with cloudless splendor into our
   souls; but we must keep the soul constantly open to its influences. We
   cannot lay up in one hour a stock of light and heat for the next. We
   may in faith pray, "Give us this day our daily bread;" but we shall
   need to pray the same prayer tomorrow. Our dependence upon God is
   absolute and unremitting. As the law of gravity draws the earth toward
   the sun every moment, so does the law of love draw a saved soul toward
   God.

CHAPTER 38

  SEEKING HOLINESS

   The way to seek holiness is, to seek it. You must be determined about
   it. You never put in any "ifs" when you are looking for something which
   you know can be found. So, when seeking for holiness do not say, even
   to yourself, "I will have it, if it is for me." Such an expression will
   weaken your faith. You know it. is for you. Leave the "if"out. God
   commands you to be holy. That is evidence enough. You have not as
   strong an evidence that you can gain anything else for which you seek.
   God requires that you should serve Him in the beauty of holiness. This
   service is reasonable, because it is within your reach. The servants of
   some masters are required to furnish their own delivery. It is not so
   with the servants of Christ. When He says, "Put on thy beautiful
   garments" (Isa. 52:1), He has them at hand, all fitted and furnished.
   His supply never fails. He requires no pay. All He asks of you is to
   put them on. But in doing this you must follow His directions.

   Do not expect God to do what He commands. you to do. He will help you,
   but you must help yourself. No amount of praying will take the place of
   obedience. Many pray for cleansing, to whom God says,


   "Cleanse yourselves."--James 4:8; II Cor. 7:1.

   In putting on new clothes you put off the old ones. This is the order
   of nature. It is the order of God. It is of no use to try to reverse
   this order. If you attempt it you will fail. And you will fail just as
   often as you attempt it.

   If you want God to save you from filthy appetites, you must cease from
   filthy practices. If you would have Him to take away the love of
   tobacco, you must forever quit using tobacco. You ask the Lord to take
   all the pride out of your heart; He commands you to lay all the
   evidences of it off from your person. Until you consent to do it, yon
   cannot go a step farther. Do not let time-serving teachers deceive you
   on this point. They may tell you that God does not care about dress. He
   does care about the dress of His children; or He would not have said so
   much respecting it, in His word. In short you cannot take one step
   forward in the divine life, without some outward reformation of
   manners.

   We once asked a Roman Catholic sister, devoted to the cause of
   education, what her work was. She replied, "Sometimes I am preceptress
   of a Young Ladies' Seminary; and sometimes I am janitress, having to
   close the doors and sweep the halls; but I am as ready for the one as
   for he other."

   So, if you would have true holiness you must set yourself apart to do
   whatever God requires at your hands.

   In seeking holiness come to God for yourself. Realize that it is a
   transaction wholly between God and your own soul. It may do good to get
   others to pray for you. It will do no harm, unless you depend on their
   prayers. But you must come to God for yourself. Make your supplication
   to Him. Believe that He hears. You are asking what He has
   promised--therefore expect it.


   "And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask
   anything according to his will, he heareth us. And if we know that he
   hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we
   desired of him."--I John 5:14, 15.

   Then when you ask and receive, believe that you receive what you ask
   for and not some worthless imitation. Your confidence in God can never
   be misplaced. He will not send you from the throne of grace deceived.
   Have faith in God.

   God has commanded it. Does He say "Thou halt not steal?" With equal
   plainness He says, "Be ye holy." (Lev. 20:7. Num. 15:40. I Pet. 1:15,
   16.) Here is a plain command, reiterated at long intervals, and under
   different dispensations. It is not a matter which is left to our own
   choice. It is imperatively required by our God.

   It is necessary to our well being in time and in eternity that we obey
   this command for:


   "Without holiness no man shall see the Lord."--Heb. 12:14.

   How shall we seek holiness? Permit us to answer in the words of C.
   Larew, written quarter of a century ago.

   "First of all, you will dedicate all to Him. Not but what all you have
   is His, and has been from the beginning, but you have not so regarded
   it. You have taken your portion and gone your way heretofore, wasting
   your Father's gifts in selfish living. Let all this cease at once; and
   let it be your language, the language of your heart, What wilt Thou
   have me to do?' In word, consecrate all to your Heavenly Father. How
   will you do this? We answer,--consent and decide, that all, whether
   act, word, thought, desire or possessions shall be not as self, or men
   may will, but as God wills. This, you say, I have tried to do again and
   again. Doubtless you have, and done it acceptably, too. But here you
   halted; you did not believe. Believe what? you ask. I answer,--the word
   of God to you at that point. That word is that He accepted' and
   received' you. Hear Him,--Be ye separate and I will receive you.' You
   separated yourself, presented yourself a living sacrifice;' but did not
   believe on the assurance of His word, that you were accepted. No, you
   waited for some sign, some sensible manifestation, to come up in your
   feelings, to assure you that all was received, thus making some
   preconceived emotion the ground of faith. God does not say, faith
   cometh by feeling, joyous, peaceful, or otherwise, else you would be
   right in expecting it to rise and inspire you with faith. Nay, FAITH
   COMETH BY HEARING, and hearing by the word of God.' Therefore, when you
   consecrate all, as well as you are enabled, you have God's word for the
   fact that he RECEIVES YOU.' This faith will inspire you with feelings
   of peace, gladness, and great quiet of soul. In God's order, faith
   gives rise to feelings, and not feelings to faith, as you have
   erroneously supposed. Hence, you may take God's word and rest upon
   that. There is no error in this. It is the only way of success; as has
   been tried and proved by hundreds, after having struggled and
   floundered in this same error.

   "To illustrate: suppose the Lord had said, in His abiding word, If any
   man will place twelve stones upon the earth, and put a lamb thereon,
   and burn it to ashes, I will receive him, and be a Father unto him, and
   he shall be my son.' Now, I ask, if you should do this, and the lamb be
   consumed to ashes, would you not have God's word for your assurance?
   Yea, as convincingly as if heard audibly from Heaven,--that He received
   you.'

   "The Lord has not said this; but He has said, as shown above, that if
   we come out from among them, and BE SEPARATE, and touch not the unclean
   thing, He WILL RECEIVE US.' Now, I ask, if we thus do, have we not the
   testimony of the Spirit, written in the word, that we are accepted? Do
   not fall into the common error of separating the letter of the word
   from the spirit of the word. You must by faith, regard the letter as
   the testimony and expression of the mind and spirit of God to you; just
   as you believe the letter of a friend to be the expression of his mind
   and spirit. It is through this written word, directly or indirectly,
   that the Spirit speaks, testifies, or witnesses to us. To regard the
   word as a dead letter, is to remain in darkness and unbelief. To faith,
   these words are spirit and they are life.' Let us, therefore, believe,
   nothing doubting.'

   "But, says one, How am I to know that the consecration is complete!' I
   answer, if you see nothing to the contrary, it is; for the Lord has
   said, If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this
   unto you.' The question is not, what will come up in the future to
   sacrifice and to suffer. In this, Take no thought for the morrow,'
   applies as well as in anything else. But do you not accept of the will
   of God as it is made to appear at the present moment? If this is so,
   this is all that the King requires. Only let this continue, moment by
   moment, and all will continue acceptable to Him. How great the rest of
   soul gained by him who thus comes into the truth.

   "But, you ask, into what state, or degree of godliness may I now
   apprehend the Lord has brought me? Are my inward foes all dead? Shall I
   feel the roots of sin no more from this time?

   "This is an important question--one, the understanding of which, may
   have much to do with your future peace and success in the way of
   holiness. Many, who have dedicated all, and believed, have been
   disappointed in finding, after a little while, the old self-nature stir
   within them, and either took it as an evidence that they were deceived,
   or soothingly called it only temptation;' and have continued to try to
   believe that all was entirely pure within.

   "We forget that there are two parts, or elements, in entire
   sanctification. The one is the placing of the creature, or sacrifice,
   upon the altar,--Consecration. The other is the consuming of it to
   ashes, or to its primitive elements, by God's own fire. The gold must
   first be put into the crucible; and then melted, and purified, by
   separating all its inner dross.

   "We must first consent and covenant to give up all things,' and then
   suffer the loss of all. First be nailed to the cross and then die
   daily,' till the world is crucified to us,' and we live not, but Christ
   in us."

   "With the first, you have now complied, I trust. If so, you are
   'sanctified,' but perhaps not wholly;' you are holy,' but perhaps not
   yet perfected.' You are now as the gold in the crucible, and can begin
   to say, though he slay me yet will I trust in him;' and hence ready to
   abide the fire.' Abide his coming,' as a refiner and purifier. If so,
   you are fully in the hands of the potter,' and He can now begin to mold
   you as He will, for you will now be able to abide,' and not draw back,'
   as you once did when trial came, erroneously considering it an evidence
   that God was displeased, and no longer accepted you.

   "We often make a joyous and gladsome state of the mind, the only
   evidence of our acceptance with the Father. This is a very mischievous
   error. To do this, is to make the faith of our acceptance depend upon
   our emotions or feelings, as we saw above; whereas the word' is the
   only true basis of faith; on compliance with which all the promises
   become ours. We forget the Saviour endured this, and yet was just as
   acceptable to the Father as when His emotion were the opposite. And
   now, as we are called to endure hardness,' and it is given us to suffer
   with Christ,' and also to bear some afflictions for a moment,' we must
   certainly not consider any one state of feeling the only acceptable
   one. For if, when need be,' we are in heaviness, then heaviness must be
   felt. If to endure hardness, then hardness must be felt. And if we are
   to have afflictions' then we must sometimes feel afflicted.' You
   therefore see that if you take one class of emotions to be the evidence
   of your acceptance, when you feel thus, your faith in God will abound.
   But, since our feelings necessarily change and vary, as we have seen
   above, our faith in this case will sometimes be lost, and we fall into
   consequent weakness and sadness, if not into gloom and discouragement.
   Nay, such anchor-ground is too unstable. We need the immovable promise
   of God, which holds both 'sure and steadfast,' amid all the varying
   storms, winds, and rolling billows that come upon us.

   "The only true test point required of us is in the will. If this be
   true,--if it be in the heart to say, Thy will be done,' we are
   accepted, let our feelings be what they may; for where there is a
   willing mind, it is accepted.' Ah, this living by feeling, instead of
   by faith, has made sad havoc of many a promising disciple. It reverses
   the order of God, and keeps the soul off its only true foundation--the
   promise of the Father. It is being much as the spoiled child, who,
   because it is not permitted constantly to feed upon sweetmeats, but is
   called by its parent to partake of substantial fare, and sometime to
   take that which is bitter, and also to go forth and endure that which
   is hard and afflicting' loses confidence in the love and wisdom of its
   father, and sadly refuses to do his will.

   "Oh! my brother, let your motto be,--Not my will but thine be done.' Do
   unto me as seemeth unto thee good,' and all will be well.

   "Remember, He sitteth as a refiner and purifier of silver, whose
   business it is, not to see there is no fire to try us, and no dross
   revealed, but to see that the fire gets not too hot, lest it injure and
   destroy; nor too cool, lest it do not accomplish its end, the
   purification of the heart from all its selfish nature.

   "Neither is He at a loss for fuel from which to make these purging
   fires. They come from any and every circumstance around us, that is
   needful to cross our wills; from many little things connected with
   ourselves, our families, our tenderest friends, and the common business
   of life, and even from our religious services. He will cause a fire to
   glow forth, giving us a sense of the cross, mortification and death
   which are necessary to the perfect submission of our wills, and entire
   acquiescence with God. And if these fiery trials which are to try you,
   reveal hidden selfishness and sin, as the lance reveals offensive
   matter not before seen, because lying hid deep within, be not
   disheartened. It is your physician at work wisely, and accomplishing
   the object of your desire, a perfect cure. Courage brother! Keep your
   confidence! The ore must be fused before the dross can separate and
   pass off. We must die in order to live. And His soothing encouragement
   to you is, And after you have suffered awhile, I will strengthen,
   establish and perfect you.' "

   "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we
   ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be
   glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without
   end. Amen."
