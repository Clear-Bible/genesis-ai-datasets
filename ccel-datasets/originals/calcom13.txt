   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE

   All who take delight in the Holy Scriptures are familiarly acquainted
   with the writings of The Prophet Isaiah. Every variety of taste finds
   in them its appropriate gratification. Lofty conceptions, illustrated
   by splendid imagery, and clothed in language usually copious and
   flowing, sometimes abrupt, but always graceful, leave no room for
   hesitation to pronounce him, with Bishop Lowth, to be "the most sublime
   and elegant of the Prophets of the Old Testament." He is regarded with
   peculiar veneration as an honest, fearless, and able messenger of the
   Most High God, boldly reproving nobles and monarchs, denouncing the
   judgments of Heaven against all transgressors, and asserting the claims
   of the Divine law and government above all human authority. In his
   Prophecies he takes a wide range, surveys those nations which power or
   wealth or learning or commerce had raised to the highest celebrity in
   those remote times, and describes their rise and fall, and wonderful
   revolutions, so eagerly traced by us in the page of history, as the
   execution of Jehovah's counsels, and the arrangements of unerring
   wisdom. But chiefly does he pour out rich instruction concerning the
   Messiah, whose life and sufferings, and death and glorious reign, he
   delineates so faithfully, and with such thrilling interest, that he has
   obtained the appellation of "The Evangelical Prophet." To the devout
   reader there is added a still more powerful attraction in his seraphic
   piety, which, breathing throughout all his communications, and kindling
   a holy flame in the hearts of the children of God, attests the
   important fact, not only that in the visions of God he reached the
   noblest heights of inspiration, but -- which was far more valuable --
   that he enjoyed habitual and intimate fellowship with The Father of
   Spirits.

   The period during which he exercised the prophetical office is
   declared, in the inscription of his Prophecies, to have been during the
   reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. Beyond
   this general indication nothing certain can be obtained; for dates were
   only beginning to attract the notice of civilized nations, and had not
   yet been examined with such carefulness, or denoted with such
   precision, as their importance demands. The Translator of "The
   Commentaries on the Twelve Minor Prophets" (volume 1, page 12) tells us
   that Isaiah flourished between 810 B.C and 698 B.C. This interval of
   112 years leaves a large margin, which chronologers have filled up with
   considerable diversity of views.

   Assuming 763 B.C. to be the year in which the prophetic ministry of
   Isaiah is believed by some to have commenced, we are led to observe
   this remarkable coincidence, that about thirteen years earlier began
   the Grecian or Olympic era, which opens with the First Olympiad; and
   about ten years later began the Roman Era, which opens with the
   founding of the city of Rome. This reminds us to glance at the
   contemporary history of nations unlike in their origin and progress,
   and in the effects which they produced on the human race. Historians,
   to whom the name of despised Palestine was scarcely known, have traced
   the brilliant career of those gigantic empires by which it was
   overshadowed. While amidst a long list of warriors, and poets, and
   orators, and statesmen, who were supposed to have achieved a deathless
   fame, those empires hastened to decay, Isaiah and his brethren the
   prophets were laying the foundations of the universal dominion and
   glorious reign of Him who hath on his vesture, and on his thigh, a name
   written, King of kings, and Lord of lords. (Revelation 19:16.). During
   the season of highest prosperity, when the literature of Greece and
   Rome, which even now exerts a powerful influence on modern Europe,
   enjoyed its most exalted renown, that undisguised heathenism which
   disowned the government and denied the perfections of the Most High
   God, presented a humiliating contrast to those noble and affecting
   views of the Divine nature and attributes and works which prevailed in
   the land of Jehovah. The difference reminds us of one of the plagues of
   Egypt; for there was spread over the nations a moral darkness, a
   darkness which might be felt, but all the children of Israel had light
   in their dwellings. (Exodus 10:21, 23.). Rome was proud of having
   reduced that favoured land to the rank of one of her provinces, and
   struck medals to represent Judea sitting under a palm-tree bewailing
   her captivity; but the religion of Judea, instead of being crushed and
   annihilated, assumed the more lovely aspect of the religion of Jesus,
   and went forth conquering and to conquer.

   Many of our Author's published Commentaries were nothing else than
   reports of his public Lectures. Budaeus [1] has explained the manner in
   which these reports were prepared. The language was extemporaneous,
   and, had we not known his prodigious command of the Latin tongue, we
   might have wondered at the elegance with which he spoke on such
   occasions; but his slow and distinct utterance, as Scaliger assures us,
   was such as to enable an expert writer to take down the very words
   which Calvin used. Two or three scribes were usually employed, and a
   copy, drawn out by a comparison of their manuscripts, was submitted to
   the perusal of the Lecturer, who, after making any corrections which
   appeared to be necessary, attested it as a faithful record of what had
   been uttered.

   This Commentary has come down to us in a still more authentic shape.
   Not only does the Author assert, in his Dedication to King Edward,
   which was prefixed to the First Edition, that it had been "faithfully
   and skillfully compiled from his Lectures," [2] but in his Dedication
   to Queen Elizabeth, prefixed to the Second Edition, he pronounces the
   revision to have been so thorough and laborious, that "it ought justly
   to be reckoned a new work." [3] It is highly gratifying to find that,
   in the exposition of a book so important and extensive as the
   prophecies of Isaiah, Calvin gave the fruits of his mature judgment,
   while he was in the full vigour of his age.

   Clement Cotton translated this Commentary into English from the French
   Version, in 1609. His translation, though not altogether suitable to
   modern taste, is faithful, vigorous, idiomatic, and not inelegant. To
   this volume is prefixed his Title-page and "Epistle Dedicatorie,"
   together with a curious "Epigram," in which a physician of that period
   expresses his warm admiration of the great Reformer.

   In the concluding volume of this Commentary will be given a Literal
   Translation of Calvin's Latin Version, and copious Indices similar to
   those which have already appeared in the other Commentaries.

   Auchterarder, 17^th May, 1850.

   TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTIE PRINCE,

   HENRIE

   PRINCE OF GREAT BRITTAINE,
   SONNE AND HEIRE APPARANT TO OUR

   Soveraigne Lord, James King of Great Brittaine, etc.

   AND TO THE MOST NOBLE AND
   VERTUOUS PRINCESSE,

   THE LADY ELIZABETHS GRACE,

   His Highnesse most deare Sister; all honour and happinesse, with
   eternall glorie through Christ Jesus.

   Most gracious and renowned Princes, having translated out of French
   into our English tongue the booke of the prophecie of Isaiah,
   interpreted and expounded by Master John Calvin, of reverend memory: I
   humblie crave that it may be published under your most Princely names
   and protection. The reason of this my humble petition is, that the
   honor of so noble a worke may not be imbased by the meanes of my
   endevours. This Prophet, by birth, was the sonne of Amos, esteemed by
   many to have been brother to Azarias King of Judah, and Father in law
   to King Manasses: which being so, this Prophet was by birth of the
   blood Royal, and descended of the house of David, which for the promise
   of Christ to come of him, was the most noble house of all the Kings of
   the earth. Being so borne, his education could not be but Princely, and
   his bringing up in all good learning, wisdome, vertue, and honor. His
   spirituall graces, not attained unto by ordinarie meanes, but inspired
   into him immediately by the Spirit of God, were excellent. This
   appeareth particularly in the sixth Chapter of this Prophecie,
   declaring that an Angell of God with a burning coale taken from the
   Lords Altar, and laide to the mouth of the Prophet, refined his lips
   and his tongue, that they became pure and precious as the finest Gold.
   The same is manifest in all the booke of his Prophecie; wherein both
   the light and the heate of that heavenly fire appeareth. For he not
   onely declared the will of God sincerely, according to the lawe and
   testimonie delivered to Moses, but also foreshewed the future events of
   the Kingdome of Judah, and of all the flourishing states and Kingdomes
   of his time.

   He Prophecieth also of the birth of Jesus Christ, as if hee had been
   taught by the Angell Gabriel; who brought the annunciation and message
   of it to the blessed Virgin his mother. Of his passion and death he
   spake, as if with the Apostle John he had stoode by when he was
   crucified. His resurrection he described, as if with all the Apostles
   he had stoode upon Mount Olivet, where the Lord tooke the cloudie of
   glorie as his heavenly Chariot to ascend and goe up to his Father. His
   zeale and indignation against sinne is evident every where, in his
   sharp reproofes of the offences of all estates.

   Finally, the book of his Prophecy beareth written in the head of it the
   names of foure Kings, in whose time he prophecied; and before whom as a
   vessell of golde he bare the name of God with great honour. All which
   things being royall, it seemed to me most convenient that his booke
   should still beare in the front of it the names of Princes. And as hee
   foreshewed that Kings should be Fosterfathers, and Queenes Nurces of
   the Church of Christ, so my desire was that his booke might be
   published under the names and protection of Christian Princes.

   Moreover, I was led hereunto by the example of this Interpreter, whose
   exposition upon Isaiahs prophesie I translate; namelie, of M. John
   Calvin, a man in his time of excellent pietie and learning; and one of
   the great lights, whereby it hath pleased God both to chase away the
   errors of poperie, as the darkness of the shadow of death; and to cause
   his marvellous and comfortable light of the Gospell to shine unto this
   present age. For hee dedicated his first exposition of this booke to
   the young Prince, King Edward the sixth, of famous memorie, for the
   princelie graces, for the zealous love of true religion, and of al
   heroical vertues, wherewith in his young yeeres he raised an admirable
   expectation of future glorie, if his precious life had long continued.
   He was also most worthily renowned with highest glorie, for that
   gracious reformation in religion, which was established by his regal
   authority, and which our English Church at this day with great comfort
   doth enjoy, under the happie government of our Soveraigne Lord the
   King, your most noble and renowned Father.

   Furthermore, the same Author setting out againe this Commentary,
   amplified and enlarged, he dedicated this second edition to our late
   most gracious Queene Elizabeth, worthie of eternall memorie in this
   Kingdome, for the reestablishing (after a few yeeres alteration) of the
   zealous reformation of her most vertuous brother. Which example hath
   led mee in most humble manner to seeke for the same worke, the high
   patronage and protection of such Princes, like those to whom hee
   presented this his service.

   To whom I know none so like as your selves, both in regard of your high
   estate, and also in like most noble descent from the united houses of
   Yorke and Lancaster. Besides which resemblance, your Highnesse also is
   of like yeeres to the yong Prince King Edward, and in the eies of all
   the kingdome, of like hope of excellent vertue and zealous proceedings
   in the advancement of Christian religion.

   In like manner your Grace resembleth the most gracious late Queene
   Elizabeth, both in her royall name, and also in the constant
   expectation of all men, to expresse in time all the princely vertues
   and graces that shined in that most renowned Princesse, from this
   Westerne part of the world, to the furthest East, and to the rising of
   the Sunne.

   In which respects, esteeming such a dedication, most like that which my
   author made of his owne worke, I have most humblie craved that this my
   translation of it might bee vouchsafed the honour to have your
   Princelie names written in the beginning of it. For notwithstanding the
   great difference that is betweene a reverend learned writer and
   expounder of the holie Scriptures, and the translator of such an
   exposition, yet this meane service hath also his good use in the Church
   of God; and is of long and tedious labour to such as take paines
   therein; which being graciouslie accepted, may encourage others to
   travell in this kind, and cause many to give thankes to God for you
   both, by whose most princely favours and protection, they are made
   partakers of such worthie writings. And I shall alwaies pray Almightie
   God, with this new yeere, to multiply many more upon you, and dailie
   replenish your hearts with all princely and heroicall graces, that may
   enable and adorne Princes of so hie estates, amongst this people.

   Your Highnesse, and Graces most humblie devoted, in all loyall and
   dutiful affection,

   Clement Cotton

   An Epigram upon the Translation

   of

   M. Calvin's Commentary

   upon the Prophecy of Isaiah.

   Thrice happy (England) if thou knewest thy bliss,
   Since Christ's eternal Gospel in thee shined
   Thou art. His beetle-blind that sees not this,
   Brutishly ingrate that with a thankful mind
   Doth not acknowledge Gods great Grace herein,
   And learn thereby for to forsake his sin.

   God's word hath long in thee been soundly taught,
   The sound thereof hath rung throughout the Land,
   And many a Soul by Fishers net been caught,
   Which erst lay thrall in Satan's cruel band:
   This favour great by none can be expressed,
   But such as have it felt in their own breast.

   Thy native sons in thine own bowels bred,
   Like faithful Shepherds have done worthily,
   And thee with store of heavenly Manna fed,
   Forcing the Wolves to leave their cruelty,
   To slink aside, and hide themselves in holes,
   In caves and dells, like pur-blind Backs and Moles.

   Tyndall, Frith, Philpot, father Latimer,
   The Gospel preached by word, by life, by death:
   Ivel, Fox, Reynolds, Fulk, and Whitaker
   To second them have spent their vital breath.
   In hot pursuit of that great Romish Bore,
   Who spoiled quite this English vine before.

   I spare to speak of Deerings silver voice,
   Of Greenhams zeal, of Perkins labours sound,
   Of hundreds more of Zion-builders choice,
   The like whereof can scarce elsewhere be found:
   Such ground-work they of Gods truth here have placed
   As never shall by Hels whole force be razt.

   Besides all these, of Sorrel Lights the chief,
   Beza, and Vrinus, many other more,
   Martyr, Musculus, for thy more relief
   Are seen in English weed abroad to go
   From place to place in every Shire and Torwne,
   To teach the Truth and throw all Errors down.

   And here presented is unto thy sight
   The Royal Prophet Esaias Evangel:
   For so me thinks I may it terme aright,
   That Prince of holy Prophets doth so well,
   So likely Christ's whole history presage,
   As if h' had lived in that same very Age.

   Whose Oracles great Calvin doth unfold
   In thine own native Tongue for thy Souls health.
   Here maist thou gather precious Stones and Gold,
   And store up heaps of Heavenly lasting wealth;

   Here maist thou find with very little Pain
   Which would'st not lose for thousand Worlds again.
   Here maist thou see the black-mouthed Atheists
   Confounded quite by Demonstration clear;
   The cunning Papist put unto his shifts,
   And made in his right Colours to appear;
   Here's Christ, his Truth, and Life, thee set before,
   Heavens Gates set open wide: what would'st thou more?

   By Francnis Hering, Doctor in Physic.

   TO HER SERENE HIGHNESS,

   NOT LESS ILLUSTRIOUS BY HER OWN VIRTUES THAN BY THE SPLENDOUR OF
   ROYALTY,

   ELIZABETH, QUEEN OF ENGLAND, ETC.

   Although, in making improvements on this Commentary, I have bestowed so
   much care and industry, most noble Queen, that it ought justly to be
   reckoned a new work, yet, as in the first edition it was dedicated to
   your brother King Edward, who, though a youth, greatly excelled the men
   of his age, and whom I wish to be held in remembrance by posterity, as
   he deserves, I had intended to make no change in that dedication. But
   since, amidst that wretched and lamentable dispersion of the Church and
   oppression of pure doctrine, which raged with prodigious violence for a
   short period, this book, together with the whole doctrine of true
   godliness, was banished from England for a time, but now, I trust,
   favored by your happy reign, will be restored to its former privileges,
   I thought that there would be no impropriety if to the name of a most
   excellent king I should join your own name, which is regarded by all
   good men with not less esteem and satisfaction. Not only was an
   opportunity offered, but necessity appeared to demand, that I should
   obtain your full protection to this Commentary, the banishment of
   which, I am aware, was beheld by a great number of your godly subjects
   with deep sorrow.

   Yet it is not so much my object to be favored with your countenance in
   my personal labors, as humbly to entreat, and by the sacred name of
   Christ to implore, not only that, through your kindness, all orthodox
   books may again be welcomed and freely circulated in England, but that
   your chief care may be directed to promote religion, which has fallen
   into shameful neglect. And if this is justly demanded from all kings of
   the earth by the Only-begotten Son of God, by a still more sacred tie
   does he hold you bound, most noble Queen, to perform this duty; for
   when even you, though a king's daughters were not exempted from that
   dreadful storm which fell with severity on the heads of all the godly,
   by the wonderful manner in which he brought you out safe, though not
   unmoved by the fear of danger, he has laid you under obligation to
   devote yourself and all your exertions to his service. So far are you
   from having any reason to be ashamed of this deliverance that God has
   given you large and abundant grounds of boasting, by confirming you to
   the image of his Son, on whom the Prophet Isaiah bestows this among
   other commendations, that from prison and judgment (Isaiah 53:8) he was
   raised to the loftiest height of heavenly dominion.

   As it is no ordinary honor to resemble such a model, so whenever you
   recollect, what ought never to be forgotten by you, from what wretched
   and fearful trembling God rescued you, by openly stretching out his
   hand, remember also that it was done for the express purpose that you,
   on the other hand, should, with invincible determination and unshaken
   firmness of mind, acknowledge your obligation to your Protector and
   Redeemer, and, laying aside all other kinds of business, a vast number
   of which I have no doubt, will crowd upon you at the commencement of
   your reign, labor to have his worship, which for a time was basely and
   disgracefully corrupted in that kingdom, restored to its former
   splendor. And if Satan, by presenting many and powerful obstructions,
   endeavor to produce fear or slothfulness, you are well aware from whom
   you ought to ask boldness to go steadily forward and to vanquish all
   opposition; and God, who bestows his blessing on the actions of private
   individuals, will not fail to grant a happy and desirable issue to his
   work.

   You ought also to be stimulated, venerable Queen, by a sacred regard to
   duty; for the Prophet Isaiah demands not only from Kings that they be
   nursing-fathers, but also from Queens that they be nursing-mothers.
   (Isaiah 49:23.) This duty you ought to discharge, not only by removing
   the filth of Popery, and by cherishing the flock which not long ago lay
   trembling and concealed, but by gathering the exiles who chose rather
   to part with the advantages of their native country than to remain in
   it so long as godliness was banished from it. This will be the crowning
   proof of your gratitude to God, and a sacrifice of most delightful
   savor, that the faithful worshippers of God, who, on account of their
   profession of the Gospel, were constrained to wander far and wide
   through distant countries, shall now, through your kindness, be
   restored to their native country. We, too, in whom that mournful
   spectacle awakened, as it ought to have done, the most poignant grief,
   have abundant cause for rejoicing, and for congratulating you, when,
   through the gracious exercise of your royal will, we see the way opened
   for the return of our brethren, not only to be at liberty to worship
   God in your Majesty's dominions, but to render assistance to others.

   And now, most noble Queen, if you shall be graciously pleased, as I
   trust you will, not to disdain this testimony of my respect for you,
   which some would perhaps reckon to be trivial and of little value, I
   shall esteem it to be no ordinary kindness, and will endeavor through
   my whole life to testify my gratitude by every means in my power.

   May the Lord guide you, most illustrious Queen, by the Spirit of
   wisdom, uphold you with invincible courage, protect and enrich your
   Highness with every kind of blessings!

   Geneva, 15th January; the day which, it was reported, had been fixed
   for your coronation; on which account I more gladly set myself to
   write, having partially recovered from an attack of quartan ague.

   TO HIS SERENE HIGHNESS,

   EDWARD SIXTH, KING OF ENGLAND, etc.

   A TRULY CHRISTIAN PRINCE.

   JOHN CALVIN.

   Though I acknowledge that this Commentary has been faithfully and
   skilfully compiled from my Lectures, yet, as it was drawn up by another
   person, I was at first afraid, most illustrious King, that if it should
   appear in public bearing your name on the Dedication, I might be
   thought not to have acted properly towards your Majesty. But this doubt
   was removed chiefly by one consideration, that as a Prophet who was of
   royal descent, and a most noble ambassador of Christ, the supreme King,
   is highly appropriate to your rank, so the labor which I had bestowed
   on the explanation of his Prophecies would be accepted and valued by
   your Majesty. His experience made him acquainted with five kings
   exceedingly unlike each other in their dispositions, to whom in
   uninterrupted succession he officiated as a teacher; and it is
   unnecessary to inform you which of these you should chiefly select for
   imitation, or to exhort you to that which you show that you are already
   sufficiently willing to do.

   Uzziah and Jotham were favorable to him, though they were not so
   courageous as they ought to have been in maintaining the worship of
   God. His chief contest was with Ahaz, not indeed as an open enemy, but
   as a cunning hypocrite full of fraud and dissimulation. The servants of
   God cannot have a more dangerous class of enemies. His successor,
   Hezekiah, not only treated the holy man with reverence, but modestly
   submitted to his doctrine like one of the common people, and, what is
   still more, endured patiently severe reproof when it was found
   necessary. Manasseh, who was the last of them, and whom a strongly
   supported Jewish tradition represents as having been his son-in-law,
   subjected him to a frightful kind of torture, and wickedly put him to
   death. But at the very time when he received assistance from those who
   were not bad kings, and even during the reign of Hezekiah himself, who
   was so valiant a supporter of godliness, he never ceased to be harassed
   by sharp and troublesome disputes, and to undergo severe conflicts, so
   hard and uncommon is it for men to assent to sound doctrine; and not
   only so, but they who resolve to discharge the prophetical office
   honestly and faithfully must carry on a continual war with the world.
   The more earnestly ought godly kings to labor to aid the servants of
   God by their countenance, that they may not be distressed beyond
   measure by the insolence of the ungodly.

   But as this virtue is excellent and truly heroic, so, if you search the
   history of all ages from the beginning of the world, it has been
   uncommon, and there have been very few by whom it was cultivated. Many
   have indolently and carelessly, as if it had been a matter with which
   they had no concern, allowed the truth of God to be crushed without
   making any resistance. But the greater part have been openly hostile,
   and have opposed it with violence and rage; and would that they who at
   the present day profess to be Christians were as earnest in upholding
   the doctrine of salvation as they are haughty in boasting of the name!

   Not to mention others, it may justly be regarded as no ordinary
   consolation amidst the present distresses of the Church, that God has
   raised you up and endowed you with such excellent abilities and
   dispositions for defending the cause of godliness, and that you so
   diligently render that obedience to God in this matter which you know
   that he accepts and approves. For although the affairs of the kingdom
   are hitherto conducted by your counsellors, and although your Majesty's
   most illustrious uncle, the Duke of Sommerset, and many others, have
   religion so much at heart, that they labor diligently, as they ought to
   do, in establishing it; yet in your own exceptions you go so far beyond
   them all as to make it very manifest that they receive no small
   excitement from the zeal which they observe in you. Not only are you
   celebrated for possessing a noble disposition, and some seeds of
   virtues, (which at so early an age is usually thought to be
   remarkable,) but for a maturity of those virtues far beyond your years,
   which would be singularly admired, as well as praised, at a very
   advanced age. Your piety especially is so highly applauded, that the
   Prophet Isaiah, I am fully convinced, will have one that will regard
   him with as much reverence, now that he is dead, as Hezekiah did when
   he was alive.

   As to the advantage which you will derive from the work, it is better
   that you learn that from your own perusal, and I have made some
   observations on that subject in the Preface. There is only one point on
   which I have resolved to say a few words to your Majesty. After having
   proclaimed God's just complaints against an ungrateful people, and
   threatened against the Jews such punishment as their base apostasy and
   inveterate rebellion deserved, that the time was at hand when they
   should be brought into a state of frightful desolation, the Prophet
   next speaks of a new and amazing restoration of the Church, and
   promises that henceforth God will secure that, in spite of enemies, it
   shall always be in a happy and flourishing condition.

   Such gladness and prosperity was tasted by those who, after their
   return from the captivity in Babylon, having set up their altars for
   sacrifices, could form the expectation of higher blessings than those
   which they at that time enjoyed; just as we, by beholding the dawn, are
   led to expect that the rising of the sun will soon follow. But when, in
   the brightness of his Gospel, Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, arose,
   all that had been so eloquently described by the revelations of the
   Prophet was far exceeded by the event. Within a short time the
   knowledge of the true God was spread almost throughout the whole world.
   Pure religion, which formerly lay despised in Judea, as in a dark
   corner, was circulated through all nations and provinces, and began to
   be honored in such a manner, that innumerable tongues, in harmony of
   faith, called on God.

   Having collected churches in various places, the Son of God erected his
   royal throne in a conspicuous situation, where it might be beheld from
   the rising to the setting of the sun. The churches, endowed with
   extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, not only obtained prodigious
   communications of the divine goodness, but were themselves striking
   exhibitions of astonishing power, which even the blind could perceive.
   And although the Son of God reigned under the Cross, yet, amidst the
   arduous conflicts of persecutions, his glory shone brighter, and his
   triumphs were more splendid than if the Church had enjoyed undisturbed
   prosperity. At length, the haughty loftiness of the Roman empire,
   yielding submission to Christ, became a distinguished ornament of the
   house of God.

   But the continuance of this prosperity was prevented by the malice and
   ingratitude of men; and thus the Spouse of Christ, deprived of so
   costly a robe, degraded from so high a rank, and stripped of such
   gorgeous raiment, was afterwards reduced to an unsightly and wretched
   condition. Some remains, indeed, God preserved, as it were in places of
   concealment; but, as to the external beauty of the Church, nothing but
   desolation, confusion, and dispersion, was to be seen for many
   centuries. And we see how, at this very day, the Roman Antichrist, far
   and wide usurping and tyrannizing over the sanctuary of God, tears,
   crushes, and tramples under his feet all that belonged to God. For
   since the purity of doctrine is there corrupted by monstrous errors,
   since shocking murder has come into the room of lawful government,
   since the sacraments are in part debased by gross corruptions, and in
   part exposed to disgraceful sale, what but melancholy ruin is left of
   the true and natural beauty of the spiritual building?

   Yet in our age, contrary to the expectation of all, the Lord hath again
   begun to raise up that which was fallen, (Amos 9:11,) that there might
   at least be left among us an outline of the true temple, in which God
   should be worshipped with purity, and according to the requirements of
   the Gospel. Some inconsiderable persons, taken from the common people,
   have been selected by him as his architects, to promote this work by
   pure doctrine. It is, indeed, an arduous and extensive work, though
   Satan should give us no annoyance. But now that he employs every
   expedient for breaking down the Church, as soon as any portion of it
   has been erected, what wonder is it if we have great and sorrowful
   toil, and make small and feeble progress?

   Accordingly, the haughty tyrants scorn us, as if, in our endeavors to
   overthrow the tyranny of the Roman See, we were laboring to overturn
   Olympus. Those clever and ingenious men (as they imagine themselves to
   be) indulge in ridiculing our perseverance, in laboring hard to restore
   the condition of the Church, as if anything fixed or permanent could be
   obtained. They imagine that they have so solid a foundation, and are so
   well defended on all sides, that it would be as difficult to destroy
   Popery as to mingle heaven and earth. But the opinions of those men are
   somewhat various. The refractoriness of the world being too great to
   admit of being placed under any restraint, they hold that we labor in
   vain when we seek to correct vices, and to promote a pure and faithful
   administration of the Church.

   The witticism of Erasmus is well known. "Whom does Capito expect to be
   his tenth successor?" He could not deny that Wolfgang Capito was a holy
   man, and labored with the purest motives to reform the Church; but
   being convinced that it is idle for the ministers of Christ to struggle
   to correct the wickedness of the world as if they were endeavoring to
   cause the rivers to run in a contrary direction, Erasmus, imitating the
   custom of lazy philosophers, represented all of us, in the person of
   one man, as chargeable with inconsiderate zeal. But on both sides they
   are greatly mistaken in not considering that, when we repair the ruins
   of the Church, we give our labors to the Lord, in obedience to his laws
   and injunctions, and yet the restoration of the Church is his own work.
   Nor is it without good reason that this is taught in every part of
   Scripture, and that it is so earnestly enforced by the Prophet Isaiah.
   Remembering this doctrine, therefore, and relying on the assistance of
   God, let us not hesitate to undertake a work which is far beyond our
   own strength, and let no obstacle turn aside or discourage us, so as to
   abandon our undertaking.

   And here I expressly call upon you, most excellent King, or rather, God
   himself addresses you by the mouth of his servant Isaiah, charging you
   to proceed, to the utmost of your ability and power, in carrying
   forward the restoration of the Church, which has been so successfully
   begun in your kingdom. First, you daily read and hear that this duty is
   enjoined on you in the kingdom over which you rule. More especially
   Isaiah, as I have said, calls Kings the nursing-fathers of the Church,
   (Isaiah 49:23,) and does not permit them to withhold that assistance
   which her afflicted condition demands. Nor ought your mind to be
   slightly affected by the consideration, that the Prophet pronounces a
   woe on all kings and nations who refuse to give her their support.
   Next, your Majesty sees plainly what is urgently demanded by the times.
   Though you may not have great success in your labors, yet, knowing that
   this worship is acceptable to God, and is a sacrifice of most
   delightful savor, you ought not to be turned aside from your purpose by
   any event, however calamitous. Seeing, therefore, that God exhorts you
   to be courageous, and at the same time promises success, why should you
   not cheerfully obey him when he calls?

   In another passage Isaiah says, Prepare the way, prepare the way for my
   people. (Isaiah 62:10.) It is well known how hopeless was the return of
   the captives to their native country. Nor did this event take place at
   that time; but the Prophet, beholding by the Spirit what posterity some
   time afterwards would actually enjoy, lest any of the godly should be
   disheartened by so sad a spectacle, meets them beforehand with the
   assurance that there would be no kind of obstructions so powerful and
   formidable that God would not break through them to deliver his Church.
   Not less do we need at this day to be cheered by consolation.

   It is of high importance, most noble King, that you should be
   stimulated to activity by the consideration of the duty enjoined on
   you; for Isaiah exhorts all kings and magistrates, in the person of
   Cyrus, to stretch forth their hand to the Church, when in distress, to
   restore her to her former condition. Yet there is this difference
   between your condition and that of Cyrus, that he who was a stranger to
   the Lord's flock never was expressly taught freely and willingly to
   come forward and undertake to be a defender of the Church; but to you,
   to whom the Lord has not only given adoption, but has likewise assigned
   a distinguished place among his sons, the Prophet may be said to
   stretch out his hand and call you to this office. So much the more
   boldly and resolutely ought you, noble King, to proceed in this course.

   The matter is, as I have said, full of great difficulties; and still
   greater are the annoyances by which it is attended, and the dangers in
   which it is involved; for Satan never ceases to employ innumerable
   expedients, if in any way he may succeed in subverting or destroying
   the holy temple of God; and sometimes God intends to make trial of our
   steadfastness by such attacks. But if you lay it down as a settled
   principle, that there is nothing which you and your most excellent
   Council have hitherto undertaken, or are now performing, for restoring
   the condition of the Church, which is not supported by the authority of
   God, you will unquestionably feel how wonderfully he accomplishes all
   those things which he gives in charge to his servants. From this happy
   result England will derive inestimable advantage; and we, too, will
   congratulate you on your prosperity, and that of your whole kingdom.
   Meanwhile, I shall aid those holy exertions by my prayers, as it is my
   duty to do, since I have nothing better to offer you.

   Farewell, most illustrious King! may the Lord prosper and preserve your
   Majesty for a long period, aid and guide you by his Holy Spirit, and
   bless you in all things! -- Amen.

   Geneva, 25th December, 1550.

   THE PREFACE TO THE PROPHET ISAIAH

   BY JOHN CALVIN

   It is customary to make a great number of statements and dissertations
   about the office of the Prophets. But, in my opinion, the shortest way
   of treating this subject is to trace the Prophets to the Law, from
   which they derived their doctrine, like streams from a fountain; for
   they placed it before them as their rule, so that they may be justly
   held and declared to be its interpreters, who utter nothing but what is
   connected with the Law. Now, the Law consists chiefly of three parts:
   first, the doctrine of life; secondly, threatenings and promises;
   thirdly, the covenant of grace, which, being founded on Christ,
   contains within itself all the special promises. As to ceremonies, they
   were religious exercises which strengthened the attachment of the
   people to the worship of God and to godliness, and consequently were
   added to the First Table. The Prophets, therefore, enter more largely
   into the illustration of doctrine, and explain more fully what is
   briefly stated in the Two Tables, and lay down what the Lord chiefly
   requires from us. Next, the threatenings and promises, which Moses had
   proclaimed in general terms, are applied by them to their own time and
   minutely described. Lastly, they express more clearly what Moses says
   more obscurely about Christ and his grace, and bring forward more
   copious and more abundant proofs of the free covenant.

   To make this matter still more clear, we must go a little farther back,
   to the Law itself, which the Lord prescribed as a perpetual rule for
   the Church, to be always in the hands of men, and to be observed by
   every succeeding age. Perceiving that there was danger lest an ignorant
   and undisciplined nation should need something more than the doctrine
   delivered by Moses, and that the nation could scarcely be restrained
   without the use of a tighter rein, God forbids them to consult
   magicians or soothsayers, augurs or diviners; enjoins them to be
   satisfied with his doctrine alone; but at the same time he likewise
   adds that he will take care that there shall never be wanting a Prophet
   in Israel. He does this purposely, with the view of meeting an
   objection which the people might have brought forward, that their
   condition would be worse than that of the infidels, all of whom had
   their priests of various orders, their soothsayers, augurs,
   astrologers, Chaldeans, and such like, whom they had it in their power
   to visit and consult, but that they would have no one to aid them by
   his advice in intricate and difficult matters. In order, therefore, to
   deprive them of every pretense, and to hinder them from polluting
   themselves by the abominable practices of the Gentiles, God promises
   that he will raise up Prophets, (Deuteronomy 18:15,) by whom he will
   make known his will, and who shall faithfully convey the message which
   he has entrusted to them; so that in future there will be no reason to
   complain that they are in want of anything. There is an exchange
   (heterosis) of the plural for the singular number, when he uses the
   word Prophet; for although, as it is expressly interpreted by Peter,
   (Acts 3:22,) that passage relates literally and chiefly to Christ,
   (because he is the head of the Prophets, and all of them depend on him
   for their doctrine, and with one consent point to him,) yet it relates
   also to the rest of the Prophets, and includes them under a collective
   name.

   When he promised to give them Prophets, by whom he would make known his
   will and purpose, the Lord commanded the people to rely on their
   interpretations and doctrine. And yet it was not intended to make any
   addition to the Law, but to interpret it faithfully, and to sanction
   its authority. Hence also, when Malachi exhorts the people to adhere to
   the purity of faith and to be steadfast in the doctrine of religion, he
   says,

   Remember the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb,
   for all Israel. (Malachi 4:4.) [4]

   He reminds them of the Law of God alone, and enjoins them to be
   satisfied with it. Does Malachi therefore mean that Prophecies should
   be despised? By no means; but as the Prophecies are appendages of the
   Law, and are all briefly summed up in the Law, that exhortation was
   sufficient; for they who understand that summary of doctrine, and its
   leading points, and carefully observe them, assuredly will not neglect
   the Prophecies. It would be absurd to boast of attending to the word,
   were we to disregard the divine interpretations of it; as many persons
   at the present day impudently boast of attending to the word, while
   they cannot at all endure the godly admonitions and reproofs which
   proceed from the doctrine of the word.

   Thus when the Prophets inculcate moral duties, they bring forward
   nothing new, but only explain those parts of the Law which had been
   misunderstood. For instance, the people thought that they had
   discharged their duty admirably, when they offered sacrifices and
   performed the outward services of religion; for the world measures God
   by its own standard, and renders to him a carnal and counterfeited
   worship. The Prophets sharply reprove this, and show that all
   ceremonies are of no avail, when sincerity of heart is wanting, and
   that God is worshipped by believing on him, and by actually calling on
   his name. This had indeed been plainly enough declared by the Law; but
   it was necessary that it should be earnestly inculcated and frequently
   brought to their remembrance, and likewise that there should be an
   exposure of that hypocrisy with which men cloak themselves under the
   guise of ceremonies. As to the Second Table, the Prophets drew their
   exhortations from it, for the purpose of showing that men ought to
   refrain from all injustice, violence, and deceit. All that they do,
   therefore, is nothing else than keeping up the people's obedience to
   the Law.

   In threatenings and promises, the Prophets have something peculiar; for
   what Moses had stated in general terms they minutely describe. They
   have likewise visions which peculiarly belong to them, by which the
   Lord revealed future events, in order to apply the promises and
   threatenings to the use of the people, and to declare more fully the
   will of God. Moses threatens, "God will pursue thee in battle; thou
   shalt be harassed by enemies abroad and by internal quarrels at home.
   Thy life shall hang as it were on a thread; thou shalt tremble at the
   rustling of a leaf," (Leviticus 26:36,) and such like. On the other
   hand, the Prophets say, "God will arm the Assyrians against thee, he
   will call for the Egyptians by a hiss, he will raise up the Chaldeans,
   Israel shall be carried into captivity, the kingdom of Israel shall be
   destroyed, the enemy shall lay waste Jerusalem and burn the temple."
   Similar observations might be made about the promises. Moses says, "If
   thou keep the commandments, the Lord will bless thee;" and then gives a
   general description of blessings. But the Prophets enter into detail.
   "This is the blessing which the Lord will bestow upon thee." Again, by
   Moses the Lord promises in this manner, --

   "Though thou be scattered and driven to the utmost parts of the world,
   yet will I bring thee back." (Deuteronomy 30:4.)

   But by the Prophets he says, "Though I drive thee into Babylon, yet
   after seventy years will I restore thee." [5]

   As to the free covenant which God established with the Patriarchs in
   ancient times, the Prophets are much more distinct, and contribute more
   to strengthen the people's attachment to it; for when they wish to
   comfort the godly, they always remind them of that covenant, and
   represent to them the coming of Christ, who was both the foundation of
   the covenant and the bond of the mutual relation between God and the
   people, and to whom therefore the whole extent of the promises must be
   understood to refer. Whoever understands this will easily learn what we
   ought to seek in the Prophets, and what is the purpose of their
   writings; and this is all that seemed necessary to be stated here on
   that subject.

   Hence we may learn in what manner the doctrine of the word should be
   handled, and that we ought to imitate the Prophets, who conveyed the
   doctrine of the Law in such a manner as to draw from it advices,
   reproofs, threatenings, and consolations, which they applied to the
   present condition of the people. For although we do not daily receive a
   revelation of what we are to utter as a prediction, yet it is of high
   importance to us to compare the behavior of the men of our own age with
   the behavior of that ancient people; and from their histories and
   examples we ought to make known the judgments of God; such as, that
   what he formerly punished he will also punish with equal severity in
   our own day, for he is always like himself. Such wisdom let godly
   teachers acquire, if they would wish to handle the doctrine of the
   Prophets with any good result.

   So much for the Prophets in general. To come to the Prophet Isaiah, the
   inscription plainly shows who he was, and at what time he uttered those
   prophecies; for it mentions the name of his father, Amoz, who is
   supposed to have been the brother of Azariah, king of Judah. Hence it
   is evident that Isaiah was of royal descent, and on this point all the
   ancients are agreed; and yet neither his birth nor his near
   relationship to the king, (for the Jews assert that he was the
   father-in-law of Manasseh,) could prevent him from being slain through
   dislike of the word; and no greater regard was paid to him than if he
   had been a person of humble rank, or had belonged to the lowest
   condition of society.

   The time when he prophesied is here pointed out by mentioning the names
   of the kings. Some think that he began to prophesy towards the end of
   the reign of King Uzziah. They found their conjecture on the vision
   related in the sixth chapter, by which, Isaiah tells us, he was
   confirmed in his office. But that conjecture rests on very slight
   grounds, as will be shown at the proper place. From this description it
   plainly appears that he prophesied during the reign of Uzziah; and on
   that point I cannot entertain any doubt.

   However this may be, it is evident that, at the very least, he
   prophesied more than sixty-four years; for Jotham reigned sixteen
   years, (2 Kings 15:33;) Ahaz as many, (2 Kings 16:2;) [6] Hezekiah
   twenty-nine, (2 Kings 18:2.) This amounts to sixty-one years. Add the
   years that he prophesied during the reign of Uzziah, and afterwards
   during the reign of Manasseh, by whom he was put to death; and there
   will be, at least, sixty-four years during which Isaiah continued,
   without interruption, to discharge the office of a Prophet. There is
   indeed a highly probable conjecture, amounting almost to certainty,
   that he prophesied ten years beyond the period which has now been
   stated; but as this does not clearly rest on historical proof, I shall
   not debate the matter any farther.

   All the servants of God ought carefully to observe this, that they may
   consider how patiently they ought to submit to their condition, how
   hard and difficult soever it may be, and ought not to reckon it a
   disgrace that they must endure many and severe trials, while they have
   before their eyes examples of such patience. It is indeed a very severe
   trial when they perceive that by their manifold exertions they are
   doing no good, and imagine that it would be a thousand times better to
   relinquish their post than to labor so long in vain. Such examples,
   therefore, they ought frequently to set before them and call to
   remembrance; how Isaiah, whose labors were numerous and extensive, had
   little success, and how Jeremiah continued for fifty years to cry aloud
   to the people, though the result was that they became more and more
   rebellious, and how no difficulties could turn them aside from their
   course. We, too, ought to proceed in the discharge of our duty, and
   patiently to endure every kind of annoyances.

   It is proper to observe also the succession of kings, who are here
   enumerated; for amidst so great a diversity, it is impossible that the
   state of public affairs could remain unchanged, as we know that,
   whenever any change takes place in a public station, the greater part
   of men immediately adopt a new manner of life; and from this source
   many vexations must have arisen. The unshaken firmness and unbroken
   courage with which he persevered ought to excite all the servants of
   God to imitation, that they may never bend or turn aside from the right
   path.

   A question may arise, Was it Isaiah himself, or some other person, that
   wrote this inscription to his Prophecy? Not one of the commentators
   whose writings I have hitherto perused answers this question. For my
   own part, though I cannot fully satisfy my mind, yet I shall tell what
   I think. The Prophets, after having publicly addressed the people, drew
   up a brief abstract of their discourse, and placed it on the gates of
   the temple, that all might see and become more fully acquainted with
   the prophecy. When it had been exposed for a sufficient number of days,
   it was removed by the ministers of the temple, and placed in the
   Treasury, that it might remain as a permanent record. In this way, it
   is probable, the books of the Prophets were compiled; and this may be
   inferred from the second chapter of the book of Habakkuk, if it be
   properly examined, and likewise from the eighth chapter of this
   Prophecy. (Habakkuk 2:2; Isaiah 8:1.) Those who have carefully and
   judiciously perused the Prophets will agree with me in thinking that
   their discourses have not always been arranged in a regular order, but
   that the roll was made up as occasion served. That these writings have
   come down to us through the agency of the Priests, whose duty it was to
   transmit the prophecies to posterity, (though the Priests were often
   the bitterest enemies of the Prophets,) is a remarkable instance of the
   providence of God.

   COMMENTARY ON THE PROPHET ISAIAH

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah Chapter 1:1-31

   1. The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
   and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings
   of Judah.

   1. Visio Isaiae filii Amoz, quam vidit super Iudam et Ierusalem in
   diebus Usiae, Iotham, Achaz, Ezechiae, regum Iuda.

   2. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I
   have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against
   me.

   2. Audite caeli, et ausculta terra; quia sic Dominus loquitur, Filios
   educavi et sustuli, ipsi tamen scelerate egerunt in me, (vel,
   rebellarunt contra me.)

   3. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel
   doth not know, my people doth not consider.

   3. Cognovit bos possessorem suum, et asinus praesepe dominorum suorum:
   Israel non cognovit, populus meus non intellexit.

   4. Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
   evil-doers, children that are corrupters! They have forsaken the Lord,
   they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone
   away backward.

   4. O gens scelesta, populus onustus iniquitate, semen malignorum, filii
   degeneres! dereliquerunt Iehovam, spreverunt (vel, provocarunt ad iram)
   sanctum Israelis, alienati sunt retrorsum.

   5. Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.
   The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

   5. Quorsum adhuc vos percuterem? Adjicietis praevaricationem. Totum
   caput languori, et totum cor dolori.

   6. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness
   in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not
   been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.

   6. A planta pedis usque ad caput nulla in eo sanitas. Vulnus, tumor, et
   saniosa plaga. Nec sunt emplastro curatae, nec circumligatae, nec oleo
   delinitae.

   7. Your country is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your
   land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as
   overthrown by strangers.

   7. Terra vestra in vastitatem: Urbes vestrae igni succensae: terram
   vestram alieni devorant in conspectu vestro, redacta est in
   solitudinem, juxta subversionem exterorum.

   8. And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a
   lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

   8. Et residua manebit filia Zion, sicut tugurium in vinea, sicut
   diversorium in cucumerario, sicut civitas vastata.

   9. Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we
   should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

   9. Nisi Dominus exercituum residuas nobis fecisset reliquias vel
   tantillas, quasi Sodoma fuissemus, et similes Gomorrhae.

   10. Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the
   law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah:

   10. Audite verbum Domini, principes Sodomae: auscultate Legem Dei
   nostri, populus Gomorrhae.

   11. To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith
   the Lord: I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed
   beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of
   he-goats.

   11. Quorsum mihi multitudo sacrificiorum vestrorum? dicit Dominus.
   Plenus sum holocaustis arietum, et adipe saginatorum animalium: nec
   sanguinem boum, aut ovium, aut hircorum desidero.

   12. When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your
   hand, to tread my courts?

   12. Quando venitis ut appareatis coram facie mea, quis hoc e manu
   vestra requisivit? nempe conterere atria mea.

   13. Bring no more oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the
   new-moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with;
   it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting;.

   13. Ne pergatis adducere oblationem vanitatis. Incensum abominatio est
   mihi. Neomeniam, et sabbathum, et solennes indictiones non potero: vana
   res est, nec conventum.

   14. Your new-moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a
   trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them

   14. Neomenias vestras et solennia vestra odio habet anima mea:
   superfuerunt mihi loco oneris, fatigatus sum ferendo.

   15. And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from
   you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are
   full of blood.

   15. Cum expanderitis manus vestras, abscondam oculos meos a vobis.
   Etiamsi multiplicaveritis orationem, ego non exaudiam. Manus vestrae
   sanguine plenae sunt.

   16. Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from
   before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

   16. Lavate, mundemini, auferte malitiam studiorum vestrorum a conspectu
   oculorum meorum, desinite mala facere.

   17. Learn to do well; seek judgment; relieve the oppressed; judge the
   fatherless; plead for the widow.

   17. Discite benefacere: quaerite judicium: restituite (vel, dirigite)
   oppressum: jus dicite pupillo: tuemini viduam.

   18. Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: Though your
   sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red
   like crimson, they shall be as wool.

   18. Venite, agedum, et disceptemus, dixit Dominus: si fuerint peccata
   vestra ut coccinum, quasi nix dealbabuntur: si rubicunda fuerint instar
   purpurae, quasi lana erunt.

   19. If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:

   19. Si volueritis, et audieritis, bonum terrae comedetis.

   20. But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword:
   for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it

   20. Quod si nolueritis, et rebelles fueritis, gladio consummemini:
   quoniam os Domini loquutum est.

   21. How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment;
   righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

   21. Quomodo facta est meretrix civitas fidelis? plena judicio fuit: et
   aequitas pernoctavit (vel, habitavit) in ea; nunc autem homicidae.

   22. Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

   22. Argentum tuum versum est in scoriam, et vinum tuum est aqua mixtum.

   23. Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one
   loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the
   fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.

   23. Principes tui perversi, et socii furum: unusquisque diligit munus,
   et inhiat mercedibus: causam pupilli non judicant, nec causa viduae
   pervenit ad eos.

   24. Therefore saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of
   Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine
   enemies:

   24. Propterea dicit Dominus, (vel, Dominator,) Iehovah exercituum,
   fortis Israel, Heu! consolationem capiam super hostibus meis,
   vindicabor de inimicis meis.

   25. And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross,
   and take away all thy tin:

   25. Convertam manum meam super te: purgabo ad liquidum scoriam tuam, et
   auferam omne stannum tuum.

   26. And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors
   as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of
   righteousness, The faithful city.

   26. Et restituam judices tuos sicut a principio, et consiliarios tuos
   ut ab initio. Tum dicetur de te, Civitas justitiae, urbs fidelis.

   27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
   righteousness.

   27. Sion in judicio redimetur, et qui reducentur ad eam, in justitia.

   28. And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall
   be together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.

   28. Contritio autem praevaricatorum et sceleratorum simul fiet; et qui
   a Domino defecerunt consumentur.

   29. For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye
   shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.

   29. Nempe pudifient ab arboribus quas concupivistis, et ignominia
   afficiemini a lucis quos elegistis.

   30. For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that
   hath no water.

   30. Eritis certe sicut arbor cujus folium marcessit, et sicut lucus non
   habens aquas.

   31. And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and
   they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them

   31. Eritque fortis vester (alias, Deus) sicut stuppa; et fictor ejus
   quasi scintilla; et comburentur ambo, nec erit qui extinguat.


   1. The vision of Isaiah The Hebrew word chzvn (chazon,) though it is
   derived from chzh, (chazah,) he saw, and literally is a vision, yet
   commonly signifies a prophecy. For when the Scripture makes mention of
   special visions which were exhibited to the prophets in a symbolical
   manner, when it was the will of God that some extraordinary event
   should receive confirmation, in such cases the word Tibet, (mr'h,)
   vision, is employed. Not to multiply quotations, in a passage which
   relates to prophecy in general the writer says, that the word of God
   was precious, because chzvn, (chazon,) vision, was of rare occurrence.
   (1 Samuel 3:1.) A little afterwards, the word mr'h: (mar-ah) is
   employed to denote the vision by which God revealed himself to Samuel.
   (1 Samuel 3:13.) In distinguishing between two ordinary methods of
   revelation, a vision and a dream, Moses speaks of a vision (mr'h) as
   the special method. (Numbers 12:6.) It is evident, however, that the
   seer, hr'h, (haroeh,) was the name formerly given to prophets, (1
   Samuel 9:9;) but by way of excellence, because God revealed to them his
   counsel in a familiar manner.

   So far as relates to the present passage, this word unquestionably
   denotes the certainty of the doctrine; as if it had been said that
   there is nothing contained in this book which was not made known to
   Isaiah by God himself. The derivation of the word, therefore, deserves
   attention; for we learn by it that the prophets did not speak of their
   own accord, or draw from their own imaginations, but that they were
   enlightened by God, who opened their eyes to perceive those things
   which otherwise they would not of themselves have been able to
   comprehend. Thus the inscription of Isaiah recommends to us the
   doctrine of this book, as containing no human reasonings, but the
   oracles of God, in order to convince us that it contains nothing but
   what was revealed by the Spirit of God.

   Concerning Judah Were we to render it to Judah, it would make little
   difference, for the preposition l (al) has both significations, and the
   meaning will still be, that everything contained in this book belongs
   strictly to Judah and Jerusalem. For though many things are scattered
   through it which relate to Babylon, Egypt, Tyre, and other cities and
   countries, yet it was not necessary that those places should be
   expressly enumerated in the title; for nothing more was required than
   to announce the principal subject, and to explain to whom Isaiah was
   chiefly sent, that is, to Jerusalem, and the Jews. Everything else that
   is contained in his prophecies may be said to have been accidental and
   foreign to the subject.

   And yet it was not inconsistent with his office to make known to other
   nations the calamities which should overtake them; for in like manner
   Amos did not go beyond the limits of his calling, when he did not spare
   the Jews, though he was not sent to them. (Amos 2:4, 5.) A still more
   familiar instance is found in the calling of Peter and Paul, the former
   of whom was appointed to the Jews, and the latter to the Gentiles.
   (Galatians 2:8.) And yet Peter did not rush beyond the limits of his
   office, by preaching to the Gentiles; as, for example, when he went to
   Cornelius: (Acts 10:17:) nor did Paul, when he offered his services to
   the Jews, to whom he immediately went as soon as he entered into any
   city. (Acts 13:5; 14:1; 17:2, 10; 18:4,19.) In the same light ought we
   to view Isaiah; for while he is careful to instruct the Jews, and
   directs his labors expressly towards that object, he does not
   transgress his proper limits when he likewise takes a passing notice of
   other nations.

   Judah and Jerusalem He takes Judah for the whole nation, and Jerusalem
   for the chief city in the kingdom; for he does not make a distinction
   between Jerusalem and the Jews, but mentions it, by way of eminence,
   (kat ' exochen,) as the metropolis, just as if a prophet of the present
   day were to address the kingdom of France, and Paris, which is the
   metropolis of the nation. And this was of great importance, that the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem might not hold themselves exempted, as if they
   were free from all blame, or placed above the laws on account of their
   high rank, and thus might send the meaner sort of people to be
   instructed by homely prophets. It is a mistake, however, to suppose
   that Jerusalem is mentioned separately, on account of its being
   situated in the tribe of Benjamin; for the half of that tribes which
   was subject to the posterity of David, is included under the name of
   Judah

   2. Hear, O heavens Isaiah has here imitated Moses, as all the prophets
   are accustomed to do; and there cannot be a doubt that he alludes to
   that illustrious Song of Moses, in which, at the very commencement, he
   calls heaven and earth to witness against the people:

   Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words
   of my mouth. (Deuteronomy 32:1.)

   This is unquestionably a very severe protestation; for it conveys this
   meaning, that both turn to the elements which are dumb and devoid of
   feeling, because men have now no ears, or are bereft of all their
   senses. The Prophet, therefore, speaks of it as an extraordinary and
   monstrous thing, which ought to strike even the senseless elements with
   amazement. For what could be more shocking than that the Israelites
   should revolt from God, who had bestowed on them so many benefits?
   Those who think that by heaven are meant angels, and by earth men,
   weaken too much the import of those words, and thus destroy all their
   force and majesty.

   Almost all the commentators consider the clause to end with the words,
   for the Lord hath spoken; as if the Prophet had intimated, that as soon
   as the Lord opens his sacred mouth, all ought to be attentive to hear
   his voice. And certainly this meaning has the appearance of being more
   full; but the context demands that we connect the words in a different
   manner, so as to make the word hear to refer, not in a general manner
   to any discourse whatever, but only to the expostulation which
   immediately follows. The meaning therefore is, Hear the complaint which
   the Lord brings forward, I have nourished and brought up children, etc.
   For he relates a prodigy, which fills him with such horror that he is
   compelled to summon dead creatures as witnesses, contrary to nature.

   That no one may wonder at the circumstance of his addressing dumb and
   lifeless objects, experience very clearly shows that the voice of God
   is heard even by dumb creatures, and that the order of nature is
   nothing else than the obedience which is rendered to him by every part
   of the world, so that everywhere his supreme authority shines forth;
   for at his bidding the elements observe the law laid down to them, and
   heaven and earth perform their duty. The earth yields her fruits; the
   sea flows not beyond her settled boundaries; the sun, moon, and stars
   perform their Courses; the heavens, too, revolve at stated periods; and
   all with wonderful accuracy, though they are destitute of reason and
   understanding But man, endued with reason and understanding, in whose
   ears and in whose heart the voice of God frequently sounds, remains
   unmoved, like one bereft of his senses, and cannot bend the neck to
   submit to him. Against obstinate and rebellious men shall dumb and
   lifeless creatures bear testimony, so that they will one day feel that
   this protestation was not in vain.

   I have nourished Literally it runs, I have made them great; [7] but as
   he is speaking about children, we cannot obtain a better rendering than
   I have nourished, or, I have brought up; [8] for instead of the verb,
   to nourish, [9] the Latins employ the phrase, to bring up children [10]
   But he afterwards mentions other benefits which he had bestowed on them
   in rich abundance; as if he had said, that he not only had performed
   the part of a kind father, by giving them food and the ordinary means
   of support, but had labored to raise them to an honorable rank. For in
   every sort of kindness towards them he had, as it were, exhausted
   himself, as he elsewhere reproaches them,

   What could have been done to my vineyard that I have not done? (Isaiah
   5:4.)

   A similar charge the Lord might indeed have brought against all
   nations; for all of them he feeds, and on all he confers great and
   multiplied benefits. But he had chosen the Israelites in a peculiar
   manner, had given them a preference above others by adopting them into
   his family, had treated them as his most beloved children, had tenderly
   cherished them in his bosom, and, in a word, had bestowed on them every
   kind of blessings.

   To apply these observations to our own times, we ought to consider
   whether our condition be not equal, or even superior to that which the
   Jews formerly enjoyed. Their adoption into the family of God bound them
   to maintain the purity of his worship. Our obligation is twofold; for
   not only have we been redeemed by the blood of Christ, but he who once
   redeemed us is pleased to favor us with his Gospel, and in this manner
   prefers us to all those whom he still allows to remain blinded by
   ignorance. If we do not acknowledge these things, how much severer
   punishment shall we deserve? For the more full and abundant the grace
   of God which hath been poured out on us, the higher will be the
   ingratitude of which it shall convict us.

   They have revolted. [11] Jerome translates it, they have despised; [12]
   but it is plain enough, from many passages, that phs (pashang) means
   something more, namely, revolt. God declares, that by no acts of
   kindness could they be kept in a state of obedience, that they were
   utterly disaffected and estranged, like a son who leaves his father's
   house, and thus makes manifest that there remains no hope of his
   improvement. It is indeed a monstrous thing that children should not be
   obedient to their father, and to a Father who is so kind, and who gives
   unceasing attention to his family. Lycurgus refused to enact a law
   against ungrateful persons, because it was monstrously unnatural not to
   acknowledge a benefit received. A child who is ungrateful to his father
   is therefore a double monster; but a child who is ungrateful to a kind
   and generous father is a threefold monster. For he employs the word
   children, not for the purpose of treating them with respect, but in
   order to exhibit that revolt in a more striking manner, and in more
   hateful colors.

   3. The ox knoweth his owner This comparison marks the more strongly the
   criminality of the revolt; for the Lord might have compared his people
   to the Gentiles; but he is still more severe when he compares them to
   dumb beasts, and pronounces them to be more stupid than the beasts are.
   Though beasts are destitute of reason and understanding, still they are
   capable of being taught; to such an extent, at least, as to recognize
   those who feed them. Since, therefore, God had not only fed this people
   at a stall, but had nourished them with all the kindness which is wont
   to be exercised by a father towards his sons, and had not only filled
   their bellies, but supplied them daily with spiritual food; having
   perceived them to be so exceedingly sluggish, he justly considers that
   they deserve to be taught in the school of beasts, and not of men; and
   therefore he sends them to the oven and asses to learn from them what
   is their duty. Nor ought we to wonder at this; for the beasts
   frequently observe the order of nature more correctly, and display
   greater kindness, than men themselves.

   Not to multiply instances, it will be sufficient to notice that which
   is here mentioned by Isaiah, that the beasts, though they are
   exceedingly dull and stupid, do, notwithstanding, obey their masters
   and those who have the charge of them. But if we choose to attend to
   other points in which they excel men, how many shall we discover? What
   is the reason why scarcely any animal is cruel to its own species, and
   that it recognizes in another its own likeness? What is the reason why
   all animals commonly bestow so much care in rearing their young, while
   it frequently happens that mothers, forgetful of the voice of nature
   and of humanity, forsake their children? What is the reason why they
   are accustomed to take no more meat and drink than what is sufficient
   for sustaining their life and their strength, while men gorge
   themselves, and utterly ruin their constitutions? In a word, What is
   the reason why they do not, in any respect, transgress the laws which
   nature has prescribed to them?

   The papists, who are accustomed to set aside the true meaning of the
   Scriptures, and to spoil all the mysteries of God by their own
   fooleries, have here contrived an absurd fable; for they have falsely
   alleged that the oxen and asses in the stall worshipped Christ when he
   was born; by which they show themselves to be egregious asses. (And
   indeed I wish that they would imitate the ass which they have invented;
   for then they should be asses worshipping Christ, and not lifting up
   the heel against his divine authority.) For here the Prophet does not
   speak of miracles, but of the order of nature, and declares, that those
   who overturn that order may be regarded as monsters. We must not
   contrive new miracles for the purpose of adding to the authority of
   Christ; for, by mingling the false with the true, there is danger lest
   both should be disbelieved; nor can there be any doubt but that, if
   such a miracle had been wrought, the Evangelists would have committed
   it to writing.

   Israel doth not know. The name Israel, which he contrasts with those
   beasts, is emphatic. We know how honorable it was for the posterity of
   Abraham to be known by this name, which God had bestowed on the holy
   patriarch, because he had vanquished the angel in wrestling. (Genesis
   32:28.) So much the more dishonorable was it for bastard and rebellious
   children to make false boasting of that honor. First, there is an
   implied reproof, not only because those who do not at all resemble the
   holy mall do wrong in assuming his name, but because they are
   ungrateful to God, from whom they had received most valuable blessings.
   Secondly, there is also conveyed an indirect comparison; for the higher
   their rank was in being far exalted above all other nations, so much
   the greater disgrace is flow intended to be expressed by separating
   them from other nations under the honorable designation of Israel

   The Greek translators have added the word me [13] ; but I prefer to
   repeat what he had said before, Israel doth not know His Owner, that
   is, God; nor his crib, that is, the Church, in which he had been
   brought up, and to which he ought to be attracted; while those beasts,
   on the other hand, recognize the master by whom they are nourished, and
   willingly return to the place where they have been fed.

   4. Ah sinful nation! [14] Though he held already reproved their crime
   with sufficient severity, yet, for the purpose of exposing it still
   more, he adds an exclamation, by which he expresses still more strongly
   his abhorrence of such base ingratitude and wickedness. Some are of
   opinion that the particle hvy (hoi) denotes grief; Jerome renders it
   vae (Wo to); but for my part I reckon it sufficient to say that it is
   an exclamation, suggested partly by astonishment, and partly by sorrow.
   For we burst into loud cries, when the disgracefulness of the action is
   such as cannot be expressed in plain terms, or when we want words to
   correspond to the depth of our grief Where we have rendered wicked
   nation, the Greeks have translated hamartolon that is, a sinner; and
   such is likewise the rendering of the Vulgate. But the Hebrew word
   denotes those who are given up to crime; and the Prophet unquestionably
   charges them with abandoned wickedness.

   A people laden with iniquity The force of the metaphor ought to be
   observed; for not only does he mean that they are sunk in their
   iniquity, as in a deep mire, but he likewise brings a charge against
   them, that they sin, not through mistake or thoughtlessness, as
   frequently happens with those who are easily led astray, but that they
   follow out their rebellion with a firm purpose of mind; as if he had
   said that they were the slaves of sin, or sold to act wickedly.

   When he adds, a seed of evil-doers, he means a wicked seed. Others,
   with greater ingenuity, consider this passage to mean, that they are
   declared to be unworthy of holding a place among the children of
   Abraham, because they are bastards, and not related to him; as they are
   elsewhere called the seed of Canaan, and are reproached with being
   uncircumcised, (Jeremiah 9:26,) as if they had been the descendants of
   heathens and foreigners. But it is customary with the Hebrews to employ
   the phrase, "children of the good" for "good children," a mode of
   expression which has been imitated by the Greeks. [15]

   Degenerate children. The word mschytym (mashchithim) literally means
   corrupting, and accordingly translators supply the word themselves, or,
   their pursuits. But I reckon that degenerate is a more appropriate
   rendering; for the Prophet means that they are so depraved as to be
   altogether unlike their parents. The four epithets which are here
   bestowed by him on his nation are far from being honorable, and are
   widely different from the opinion which they had formed about
   themselves. For this is the manner in which we must arouse hypocrites;
   and the more they flatter themselves, and the farther they are from
   being regulated by the fear of God, so much the more ought we to wield
   against them the thunderbolts of words. On such persons a milder form
   of instruction would produce no effect, and an ordinary exhortation
   would not move them. It is necessary, also, to remove that false
   conviction of their holiness, righteousness, and wisdom, which they
   commonly employ as a disguise, and as the ground of idle boasting.

   For they have forsaken the Lord He assigns the reason why he reproves
   them with such sharpness and severity. It is, that they may not
   complain, as they are wont to do, of being treated with excessive
   harshness and rigour. And first he upbraids them with that which is the
   source of all evils, their revolt from God; for, as it is the highest
   perfection of righteousness to cleave to God, agreeably to those words
   of Moses, Now, Israel, what doth thy God require from thee but that
   thou shouldst cleave to him? [16] so, when we have revolted from him,
   we are utterly ruined. The design of the Prophet is, not to convince
   the Jews that they are guilty of a single crime, but to show that they
   are wholly apostates.

   The following words, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel, whether
   the word be rendered provoke, or despise, the latter of which I prefer,
   are undoubtedly added in order to place their sin in a still stronger
   light; for it was shamefully base to treat with contempt the favor of
   him who had chosen them alone out of all the nations to be adopted into
   his family. This is also the reason why he calls himself the Holy One
   of Israel; because, by admitting them to alliance with him, he had at
   the same time adorned them with his holiness; for wherever this name
   occurs it is ascribed to him on account of the effect. What barbarous
   pride was there in despising so great an honor! If any one choose
   rather to render the word provoke, the meaning will be, that they
   rejected God, as if they expressly intended to provoke his anger; which
   shows how detestable their apostasy is.

   They are gone away backward The meaning is, that when the Lord laid
   down to them a fixed way and rule of living, they were hurried along by
   their sinful passions; but he confirms the statement which he had just
   now made, that their licentiousness was so unbridled that they utterly
   revolted from God, and deliberately turned aside from that course to
   which their life ought to have been directed.

   5. Why should ye be stricken any more? Some render it, Upon what? or,
   On what part? and interpret the passage as if the Lord had said that he
   had not another scourge left; because so various are the methods by
   which he has attempted to bring them back to the path of duty, that no
   other way of chastising them remains to be tried. But I prefer to
   render it Why? because this corresponds to the Hebrew word, and agrees
   better with the context. It is equivalent to phrases in daily use, To
   what purpose? For what object? [17] He means that the Jews have
   proceeded to such a pitch of wickedness and crimes, that it is
   impossible to believe that chastisements will do them any good; for
   when desperate men have been hardened, we know that they will rather be
   broken to shreds than submit to correction. He complains of their
   prodigious obstinacy, like a physician who should declare that every
   remedy had been tried, and that his skill was now exhausted.

   At the same time he charges them with extreme malice; for when ungodly
   men are not even humbled by punishments, they have arrived at the very
   height of wickedness; as if the Lord had said, "I see that I should do
   you no good if I were to chastise you;" for although chastisements and
   afflictions are the remedies which God employs for curing our vices,
   yet, when they are found to be of no advantage to us, we are past hope.
   True, indeed, God does not on that account cease to punish us, but, on
   the contrary, his wrath against us is the more enflamed; for such
   obstinacy God abhors above all things else. But he justly says that his
   labor is lost when he does not succeed in bringing us to repentance,
   and that it is useless to apply remedies to those who cannot be cured.
   Thus he does not fail to double their chastisements and afflictions,
   and to try the very utmost of what can be done, and he is even
   compelled to take this course until he absolutely ruin and destroy
   them. But in all this he does not discharge the office of a physician;
   but what he laments is, that the chastisements which he inflicts will
   be of no avail to his people.

   You will yet grow more faithless It is a confirmation of the former
   statement, and therefore I separate it from the former clause, though
   there are some who put them together. It is as if he had said, "Still
   you will not cease to practice treachery; yea, you will add to your
   crimes; for I perceive that you rush to the commission of iniquity as
   if you had leagued and banded yourselves for that purpose, so that we
   can no longer hope that you will slacken in your course." The design of
   God is to exhibit their incorrigible disposition, that they may be left
   without excuse.

   The whole head is sick. Others translate it every head, and suppose
   that those terms denote the princes and nobles of the nation. I rather
   agree with the opinion of those who render it the whole head; for I
   consider it to be a plain comparison taken from the human body, to this
   effect, that the body is so severely afflicted that there is no hope of
   returning health. He points out two principal parts on which the health
   of the body depends, and thus shows the extent of the disease which, he
   tells us, has infected this wretched people to such a degree that they
   are wasting away; that the disease exists not in a single member, or in
   the extremities of the body, but that the heart itself has been
   wounded, and the head is severely afflicted; in short, that the vital
   parts, as they are called, are so much injured and corrupted that it is
   impossible to heal them.

   But here also commentators differ; for some of them view this state of
   disease as referring to sins, and others to punishments. Those who view
   it as referring to sins interpret it thus: "You are like a rotten and
   stinking body, in which no part is sound or healthy. Crimes of the
   worst description prevail amongst you, by the infection of which every
   thing is corrupted and debased." But I choose rather to interpret it as
   referring to punishments; for unquestionably God still proceeds with
   this complaint, that the nation is so obstinate as to be incapable of
   being cured by any chastisements, because, though it has been beaten
   almost to death, or at least has been maimed and frightfully torn by
   repeated blows, still it is not reformed. Such too is the import of --

   6. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness
   in it Here he proceeds with the same comparison, and repeats the same
   statement; for certainly those who explain the former part of the
   verse, as referring to punishments, do not sufficiently consider the
   remaining part of the context. If we shall admit that a nation
   corrupted by vices is compared to a diseased body, what is the meaning
   of the words which immediately follow, that the wounds have not been
   bound up or mollified with ointment? It is plain that the Prophet
   speaks of afflictions by which the nation had almost wasted away, and
   that he adduces this long-continued weakness as a proof of hardened
   impenitence. He calls it a putrifying sore, from which diseased matter
   is continually flowing, as if some concealed fountain were perpetually
   sending forth an additional supply of venom. By this comparison he
   shows that the wound is incurable, because that supply cannot be
   stopped. All this is prodigiously heightened by affirming that no
   remedies have been applied; for the three metaphors which he joins
   together -- they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither
   mollified with ointment -- have all the same meaning that the nation,
   without any hope of relief, without comfort, without remedy, is reduced
   to such a state of distress, that in such punishments the utmost
   severity of God is openly displayed.

   7. Your country is desolate Literally, it is desolation; and thus
   Isaiah goes on to speak more fully and plainly of what he had already
   said figuratively about chastisements, that the country has been
   reduced to a frightful state of devastation: for I choose to interpret
   all those statements as relating to past occurrences, because the
   Prophet does not threaten the vengeance of God, but describes those
   heavy calamities which have already happened. He upbraids them with
   indolence and stupidity in remaining unmoved by their afflictions.

   Like the destruction of strangers [18] . This is added for the sake of
   heightening the picture; for the opinion that zrym (zarim) is here put
   for zrm (zerem), an inundation, is farfetched. That word might no doubt
   be applied to enemies, but it is better to take it as literally
   denoting foreigners. The calamity is more grievous when it is brought
   on by men who are unknown, and who have come from a distant country,
   who lay waste with far greater recklessness and cruelty than
   neighboring tribes. Such men destroy cities, burn houses, buildings,
   and villages, and spread desolation all around. In short, they rush
   forward with barbarous ferocity, bent on murders and conflagrations,
   and are more eager to inflict damage than to make gain. But neighbors,
   when they have subdued a country, can retain possession of it by having
   a garrison, and as soon as a revolt is attempted, or an insurrection
   takes place, can send additional troops; and therefore they are not so
   cruel; nor do they lay waste a country from which they hope to derive
   some advantage. It is therefore no ordinary calamity, but the most
   shocking of all calamities, that is here described.

   Hence we ought to learn that, when God begins to punish us, if we do
   not repent, he does not immediately desist, but multiplies the
   chastisements, and continually follows them up with other afflictions.
   We ought therefore to abstain from such obstinacy, if we do not wish to
   draw down upon ourselves the same punishments, or at least to deserve
   the same reproach which was brought against the Jews, that though they
   had received sharp warnings, and had felt the hand of God, still they
   could not be corrected or reformed.

   Moreover, we ought not to wonder that we are visited with so great an
   amount and variety of afflictions, of which we see no end or limit, for
   by our obstinacy we fight with God and with his stripes. It must
   therefore happen with us as with wincing and unruly horses, which, the
   more obstinate and refractory they are, have the whip and spur applied
   to them with greater severity. In the present day there are many who
   almost accuse God of cruelty, as if he always treated us with
   harshness, and as if he ought to chastise us more gently; but they do
   not take into account our shocking crimes. If those crimes were duly
   weighed by them, they would assuredly acknowledge that, amidst the
   utmost severity, the forbearance of God is wonderful; and that we may
   not think that in this case the Lord was too severe, we must take into
   consideration the vices which he afterwards enumerates.

   Here an objection will be started. Why does Isaiah declare that the
   nation endured such a variety of afflictions, while we have already
   mentioned that he began to prophesy under Uzziah, [19] during whose
   reign the kingdom of Judah was in a prosperous condition? (2 Chronicles
   26:5-15.) For although, towards the end of his life, the kingdom of
   Israel met with some disasters, still this did not affect the kingdom
   of Judah. Accordingly, the Jews think that these words relate to the
   reign of Jotham, (2 Kings 15:32,) and not of Uzziah. Their opinion
   appears at first sight to have little weight; and yet, when the whole
   matter is examined, it is not destitute of probability; for we know
   that the prophets did not always attend to chronological arrangement in
   collecting their prophecies; and it is possible that this discourse of
   Isaiah was placed first in order for no other reason but because it
   contains a summary view of that doctrine which is afterwards to be
   delivered.

   Others think that they can easily get rid of the difficulty by
   interpreting the whole passage as a description of vice, and not of
   punishments; but what is said about the burning of cities and about the
   desolation of the country cannot easily be disposed of in that manner.
   If it is supposed that the Prophet speaks of the future and not the
   present condition of that kingdom, and that in the name of God he
   foretells approaching calamities, though they did not behold them with
   their eyes, I do not greatly object to that view, though it is probable
   that he treats of events which were known to them. It is a real
   narrative, and not a prediction, though in the next verse I acknowledge
   he announces the approaching result.

   8. And the daughter of Zion shall be left [20] as a cottage in a
   vineyard He alludes to a custom which exists in France, that the
   vinekeepers rear a cottage for themselves when the grapes begin to
   ripen. His next comparison, which is closely allied to the former, is
   taken from a custom of that nation of protecting also gardens of
   cucumbers [21] by means of men who kept watch during the night. He next
   explains what he intended to convey by both comparisons.

   Like a besieged city This may be explained in two ways; either that the
   whole country will be wasted, with the solitary exception of the city,
   which shall be left standing like a cottage, or that the city itself
   will be destroyed. The former interpretation is adopted by the Jews,
   and they understand this passage to relate to the siege of Sennacherib;
   but I think that it has a wider signification, and embraces other
   calamities which followed afterwards. This may indeed refer to the
   neighboring country, from the misery and devastation of which it was
   impossible but that the city should sustain much damage; but I consider
   the Prophet's meaning to be, that the evils of which he speaks shall
   reach even to the city itself, until, broken and ruined, it shall wear
   the aspect of a mean cottage

   The daughter of Zion is the name here given to Jerusalem, in accordance
   with what is customary in Scripture to give the designation of daughter
   to any nation, in the same manner as the daughter of Babylon (Isaiah
   47:1) and the daughter of Tyre (Psalm 45:12) are names given to the
   Tyrians and Babylonians. Zion is the name here employed rather than
   Jerusalem, on account of the dignity of the temple; and this figure of
   speech, by which a part is taken for the whole, is frequently employed.

   9. Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us Here he concludes what he
   had formerly declared concerning God's chastisements, that the
   desolation which shall take place -- or rather which is present, and
   which they now behold -- may be compared to the destruction of Sodom,
   were it not that the Lord snatched as it were from the burning a very
   small remnant. And this verse confirms what I formerly said, that the
   Prophet's description of the calamities which had already taken place
   is interwoven with those events which were immediately at hand, as if
   he had said, Be not deceived by flatteries; you would be in the same
   condition that Sodom and Gomorrah now are, were it not that God, in
   compassion on you, has preserved a remnant. This agrees with the words
   of Jeremiah,

   It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed. (Lamentations
   3:22.)

   Hence we ought to observe two things. First, the Prophet here describes
   utter destruction; and yet, because God had to deal with his Church and
   his beloved people, that judgment is mitigated by special grace, so
   that out of the general ruin of the whole nation God rescues his
   people, whom he justly compares to a very small remnant. But if God
   punished the crimes of the Jews by such dreadful chastisements, let us
   consider that we may share the same fate if we imitate their rebellion:
   for God had set apart that nation for himself, and had distinguished
   them from the ordinary lot of other men. Why then should he spare us if
   we shall be hardened in our ungodliness and treachery? Or rather, what
   is likely to be the result of that mass and sink of crimes in which men
   throughout the whole world give way to their passions? Unquestionably
   it will be the same with the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, unless his
   vengeance shall be restrained by a regard to that gracious covenant in
   which he promised that the Church shall be eternal; and this
   threatening, which is truly awful and alarming, is applicable to all
   obstinate and incurable men, whose vices no punishments can destroy or
   weaken.

   Again, we ought to observe that saying of Jeremiah, which I have
   already glanced at, that it must be attributed to the tender mercies of
   God that we are not altogether destroyed. (Lamentations 2:22.) For if
   We Shall Consider the vast amount Of wickedness which prevails among
   all classes, we shall wonder that even a single individual is left, and
   that all have not been removed from the land of the living; and in this
   way God withdraws his hand, (Ezekiel 20:22,) that there may be some
   Church preserved in the world. This is the reason assigned by Paul, who
   is the best interpreter of this passage, when, by quoting it, he
   represses the haughtiness of the Jews, that they may not boast of the
   mere name, as if it had been enough that they were descended from the
   fathers; for he reminds them that God could act towards them as he had
   formerly done towards the fathers, but that through his tender mercies
   a remnant shall be saved. (Romans 9:27.) And why? That the Church may
   not utterly perish; for it is through the favor which he bears towards
   it that the Lord, though our obstinacy lays him under the necessity of
   trying the severest judgments, still reserves some small seed. (Romans
   9:29.) This statement ought to yield us powerful consolation even in
   those heaviest calamities in which we are apt to think that it is all
   over with the Church; that, though everything should go into confusion,
   and the world, as we say, be turned upside down, we may persevere with
   unshaken fortitude, and may rest assured that God will always be
   mindful of his Church.

   A very small remnant This clause may be connected either with what goes
   before or with what follows, and accordingly some render it, We would
   have been almost like Sodom. But I prefer connecting it with the former
   clause, so as to deduce that the number which God had reserved out of
   the destruction is small. Some think that: k (caph) is here used
   affirmatively, so as to express the matter more strongly; and I have no
   objection to that view, though we may take it in its natural and
   literal signification, as if he had said, "and that shall be a small
   number." This declaration ought to be carefully observed; for if the
   Church does not spread far and wide, men are wont to despise her. Hence
   it comes that hypocrites are proud of their numbers; and weak men,
   terrified by the pompous display of those numbers, stagger. We also
   learn from it that we ought not to judge by the largeness of the
   number, unless we choose to prefer the chaff to the wheat, because the
   quantity is greater; but we ought to be satisfied with knowing that,
   though the number of the godly be small, still God acknowledges them as
   his chosen people; and we ought also to call to remembrance that
   consolatory saying,

   Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure
   to give you the kingdom. (Luke 12:32.)

   10. Hear the word of the Lord He confirms what he had formerly said,
   that the Lord's vengeance is not cruel; because they deserved far more
   severe punishment. For although there was a difference between them and
   the inhabitants of Sodom as to punishment, yet their guilt was the
   same; so that equal punishment might have been inflicted, if the Lord
   had not spared them. It amounts to this, that, if they have received
   milder treatment, it is not because they have sinned less heinously
   than the inhabitants of Sodom, but it must be ascribed to the mercy of
   God.

   When he gives to the rulers the name of Sodom, and distinguishes the
   people by the name of Gomorrah, this does not point out that there is a
   difference, but rather that their condition is alike. But by repeating
   the same thing twice, the diversity of the names lends additional
   elegance; as if he had said, that there is no greater difference
   between the rulers and the people than there is between Sodom and
   Gomorrah. There is, no doubt, an allusion to the various ranks of men,
   by assigning to them, separately, as it were, two cities; but as Sodom
   and Gomorrah mean the same thing, we perceive that he throws them, as
   it were, into one bundle. In short, the meaning is, "If any one shall
   form an opinion about the people and the rulers, he will find that
   there is as close a resemblance between them as between Sodom and
   Gomorrah, or between one egg and another; for no one part is more sound
   than any other part."

   The Prophet begins with stripping the Jews of their disguises, and
   justly; for while all hypocrites are accustomed to employ strange
   coverings for concealing themselves from view, that nation was
   particularly addicted to this vice, and on no subject did the prophets
   contend with them more keenly or fiercely. Along with their vaunting
   about pretended holiness pride also reigned, and they boasted of the
   grandeur and excellency of their nation as much as of ceremonies and
   outward worship. So much the more were they offended at the great
   harshness with which Isaiah addressed them. But it was necessary to
   drag their wickedness from their lurking places, and therefore the more
   haughty their demeanour, the greater is the vehemence with which the
   Prophet thunders against them. In the same manner ought we to deal with
   all hypocrites.

   The word of the Lord The Prophet takes the word and the law for the
   same thing; and yet I fully believe that he purposely employed the term
   law, in order to glance at their absurd opinion; because, by imagining
   that the offering of sacrifices, unaccompanied by faith and repentance,
   can appease God, they put an absurd interpretation on the law. By these
   words he reminded them that, by quoting Moses to them, he introduces
   nothing new and makes no addition to the law; that it is only necessary
   for them to hear what the will of God is; and that on this subject he
   will faithfully instruct them. Lest they should suppose that, by an
   unfounded belief of their own righteousness, they can deceive God, he
   likewise reminds them that the law gives no countenance to them in this
   matter.

   11. To what purpose is he multitude of your sacrifices to me? Isaiah
   now introduces God as speaking, for the purpose of making known his own
   meaning; for it belongs to a lawgiver not only to issue commands, but
   likewise to give a sound interpretation to the laws, that they may not
   be abused. Beyond all doubt, the former reproof was exceedingly
   unpalatable and oppressive to them; for what language expressive of
   stronger disapprobation or abhorrence could have been employed? They
   gloried in the name of Abraham, boasted that they were his children,
   and on this ground maintained a haughty demeanor. This is the reason
   why the Prophet arms himself with the authority of God against them; as
   if he had said, "Know that it is not with me but with God that you have
   to do."

   Next he explains the intention and design of God in demanding
   sacrifices; that he does so, not because he sets a high value on them,
   but in order that they may be aids to piety; and, consequently, that
   the Jews were greatly mistaken who made all their holiness to consist
   of those services. For they thought that they had performed their duty
   admirably well when they offered sacrifices of slain beasts; and when
   the prophets demanded something beyond this, they complained that they
   were treated harshly. Now the Lord says that he rejects and abhors
   them, which may appear to be excessive severity, for it was by him that
   they were appointed. But it ought to be observed that some of the
   commandments of God ought to be obeyed on their own account, while
   others of them have a remoter object. For instance, the law enjoins us
   to serve and worship God, and next enjoins us to do good to our
   neighbors. (Deuteronomy 6:5; Leviticus 19:18.) These things are in
   themselves acceptable to God, and are demanded on their own account.
   The case is different with ceremonies; for they are performances which
   are not demanded on their own account, but for a different reason. The
   same thing may be said of fasting;

   For the kingdom of God does not consist in meat and drink; (Romans
   14:17;)

   and therefore fasting is directed to another object.

   It follows, therefore, that ceremonies were not appointed in such a
   manner as if they were a satisfaction by which he should be appeased,
   but in order that by means of them the nation might be trained to
   godliness, and might make greater and greater progress in faith and in
   the pure worship of God. But hypocrites observe them with the most
   scrupulous care, as if the whole of religion turned on this point, and
   think that they are the most devout of all men, when they have long and
   anxiously wearied themselves in observing them. And that they may be
   thought more devout, they likewise add something of their own, and
   daily contrive new inventions, and most wickedly abuse the holy
   ordinances of God, by not keeping in view their true object. All their
   ceremonies, therefore, are nothing else than corruptions of the worship
   of God. For when their whole attention is given to the outward and
   naked performance, in what respect do their sacrifices differ from the
   sacrifices of the Gentiles, which, we know, were full of sacrilege,
   because they had no regard to a lawful end?

   This is the reason why the Lord rejects those ceremonies, though they
   had been appointed by his authority, because the nation did not
   consider the object and purpose for which they were enjoined. The
   unceasing contest between the prophets and the nation was to tear off
   these masks, and to show that the Lord is not satisfied with merely
   outward worship, and cannot be appeased by ceremonies. In all places
   godly ministers have experience of the same kind of conflicts; for men
   always form their estimate of God from themselves, and think that he is
   satisfied with outward display, but cannot without the greatest
   difficulty be brought to offer to him the integrity of their heart.

   All the perplexity of this passage will be easily removed by Jeremiah,
   who says,

   When I redeemed your fathers out of Egypt, I did not order them to
   offer sacrifices to me; I only enjoined them to hear me and to keep my
   commandments. (Jeremiah 7:22.)

   For he shows that the observance of ceremonies depends wholly on the
   word, and that it is as idle and unprofitable to separate there from
   the word as it would be for the soul to be parted from the body. To
   this also belongs the argument in Psalm 50:13, 14, --

   Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer to
   God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows to the Most High.

   And in another passage the same Jeremiah says,

   "Trust not in words of falsehood, saying, The temple of the LORD, the
   temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD are we.
   But rather excel in doing good, etc." (Jeremiah 7:4.)

   The Prophet Micah likewise says, "Doth the LORD take pleasure in
   thousands of rams, or in ten thousand rivers of oil?" Immediately
   afterwards he adds,

   "I will show thee, O man, what is good, and what the LORD requireth
   from thee, namely, to do justly, to love mercy,
   and to walk humbly with thy God." (Micah 6:7, 8.)

   From these passages it is evident that the reason why ceremonies are
   condemned is, that they are separated from the word as from their soul.
   Hence we see how great is the blindness of men, who cannot be convinced
   that all the pains they take to worship God are of no advantage unless
   they flow from integrity of heart. Nor is this vice confined to the
   common people, but is found in almost all men; and in those who in
   their opinion excel all others. Hence springs the notion of the
   efficacy which belongs to the mere performance of the outward act --
   or, as they call it, the opus operatum -- which Popish doctors have
   contrived, and which at the present day keeps a firm hold of the minds
   of many. Now here it is not man but God himself who speaks, and who
   pronounces, by an unchangeable decree, that all that men do is in vain
   offered for his acceptance, is empty and unprofitable, unless they call
   upon him with true faith.

   12. Who hath required this at your hand? What an admirable confutation
   of false worship, when God declares that they will not come before him
   according to the appointed manner, and makes a general declaration,
   that in vain do they offer to him anything which he does not require;
   for he does not choose to be worshipped in any other way than that
   which has been enjoined! For how comes it that men are so highly
   delighted with those inventions, but because they do not consider that
   all their services are neither profitable to themselves nor acceptable
   to God? Otherwise they would immediately recollect that obedience is
   all that remains for them to do; (1 Samuel 15:22;) and they would not
   so insolently vaunt of their exertions, which the Lord looks upon with
   scorn, not only because he derives no advantage from it, but because he
   does not wish that men should attribute to him what they have rashly
   undertaken without his authority, or suffer the caprice of men to pass
   for a law: Yet in order to express still stronger contempt, he
   immediately adds, that they improperly give the name of obedience to
   that which he considers to be labor thrown away; namely, that their
   close attendance at the temple amounts to nothing more than treading
   its pavements; as if, in reference to their hypocritical prayers, he
   had said, "Truly they lay me under deep obligations by stunning my
   ears."

   13. Bring no more vain oblations This is a useful admonition for
   restraining the irregular desires of those who do not cease to follow
   inveterately unmeaning and hypocritical worship, that, warned by God,
   they may at length repent, if they would listen to any advice. But
   hence we learn how hard it is to shake the false confidence of
   hypocrites, when they have once been hardened, since they cannot even
   endure to hear God plainly warning them not to go on in losing their
   pains, and in the practice of such madness.

   Incense is an abomination to one To press them more closely, he
   proceeds farther, and declares that such worship is not only
   unprofitable, but even that he detests and abhors it; and justly,
   because the profanation of the worship of God, in which his name is
   falsely employed, is not free from sacrilege. For as nothing is more
   dear to God than his own glory, so there is nothing which he more
   strongly detests than to have it infringed by any kind of corruptions:
   and this is done, when any sort of unmeaning service is put in the room
   of true worship. The meaning of this passage has been mistaken by some,
   who have thought that the Prophet speaks of the repeal of the law; for
   that is not his object, but he recalls the people of his time to the
   right manner of observing ceremonies, and shows with what design and
   for what purpose they were instituted. For since the beginning of the
   world the worship of God was spiritual, and the diversity of our
   worship from that which prevailed under the Old Testament had a
   reference to men, but not to God. In God there is no change, (James
   1:17,) but he accommodates himself to the weakness of men. That kind of
   government therefore was suitable to the Jews, just as a preparatory
   training [22] is needed for children. For what purpose they were
   instituted, and what is the right manner of observing ceremonies, he
   now describes.

   14. Your new-moons The Prophet adds nothing new to his former doctrine;
   but with respect to all ceremonies, in which there is no spiritual
   truth, but only the glare of a false pretense, he declares generally
   that they are not merely useless but wicked. Hence we ought to observe
   that we labor to no purpose, if we do not worship God in the right
   manner, and as God himself enjoins. In all things God delights in
   truth, but especially in the worship due to his majesty. Besides, not
   only do we lose our labor, but the worship of God (as we have already
   said) is perverted; and nothing can be more wicked than this. Now all
   superstitions are so many corruptions of the worship of God; it
   follows, therefore, that they are wicked and unlawful.

   Superstition may be viewed, either in itself, or in the disposition of
   the mind. In itself when men have the audacity to contrive what God has
   not commanded. Such are those actions which spring from will-worship,
   (ethelothreskeia, Colossians 2:23,) Which is commonly called devotion.
   One man shall set up an idol, another shall build a chapels another
   shall appoint annual festivals, and innumerable things of the same
   nature. When men venture to take such liberties as to invent new modes
   of worship, that is superstition. In the disposition of the mind, when
   men imitate those services which are lawful and of which God approves,
   but keep their whole attention fixed on the outward form, and do not
   attend to their object or truth. In this manner the Jews earnestly
   adhered to the ceremonies which Moses had enjoined, but left out what
   was of the greatest importance; for they paid no regard to a pure
   conscience, never mentioned faith and repentance, had no knowledge of
   their guilt, and -- what was still worse -- separated Christ from them,
   and left no room for the truth. This plainly shows, as I have already
   stated, that it was a spurious and deceitful mask; so that their
   sacrifices did not at all differ from the sacrifices of the Gentiles.
   It is therefore not wonderful that the Lord calls them abomination

   I shall not stay to notice the phrases here used, which are various;
   and yet they ought not to be lightly passed over. For the Lord
   perceives how great is the wantonness of men in contriving modes of
   worship; and therefore he heaps up a variety of expressions, that he
   may more powerfully restrain that wantonness, and again declares that
   those actions are hateful to him. Moreover, because men flatter
   themselves, and foolishly entertain the belief that the Lord will hold
   in some estimation the idle contrivances which they have framed, he
   declares, on the contrary, that he regards them with detestation and
   abhorrence.

   15. When ye spread forth your hands The ancient custom of spreading
   forth the hands in prayer did not arise from superstition; nor did that
   practice, like many others, obtain currency through foolish and idle
   ambition; but because nature herself prompts men to declare, even by
   outward signs, that they betake themselves to God. Accordingly, since
   they cannot fly to him, they raise themselves by this sign. No
   injunction, certainly, respecting this sign, was given to the fathers;
   but they used it as men divinely inspired; and by this very sign all
   idolaters are convicted of gross blindness; for, while they declare by
   an outward attitude that they betake themselves to God, in reality they
   betake themselves to idols. In order to convict them more strongly, the
   Lord permitted the uninterrupted use of this custom to continue among
   them. The Prophet, therefore, does not condemn the spreading forth of
   the hands, but their hypocrisy; because they assumed the appearance of
   men who called on God, while in their heart they were wholly averse to
   him, as he elsewhere declares more fully that

   "this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do
   honors me, but have removed their heart far from me"
   (Isaiah 29:13.)

   The Lord saith that he is nigh, but it is
   to those who call upon him in truth. (Psalm 145:18.)

   Where hypocrisy is, there can be no true calling on God. And yet this
   passage does not contradict what is said elsewhere, "When they shall
   spread forth their hands, I will hear." [23] For in that passage the
   Lord speaks of that calling which proceeds from confidence in him.
   Faith is the mother of calling on God; and if that be absent, nothing
   is left but empty mockery.

   Yea, when ye make many prayers He amplifies the former statement by
   threatening that he will be deaf to their cries, to whatever extent
   they may multiply prayers; as if he had said, "Though you be constant
   in prayer, that diligence will be of no avail to you." For this also is
   a fault which belongs to hypocrites, that the more their prayers abound
   in words, they think that they are more holy, and will more easily
   obtain what they wish. Thus their idle talkativeness is indirectly
   rebuked.

   Your hands are full of blood Here he begins to explain more fully the
   reason why he disapproves, and even disdainfully rejects, both their
   prayers and their sacrifices. It is because they are cruel and bloody,
   and stained with crimes of every sort, though they come into his
   presence with hypocritical display. Though he will afterwards add other
   kinds of crime, yet as he had mentioned the spreading forth of the
   hands, so he speaks of the hands, and says that in them they carry and
   hold out a testimony of their crimes, so that they need not wonder that
   he thrusts them back so harshly. For, on the other hand, the phrase, to
   lift up clean hands, was employed not only by prophets and apostles, (1
   Timothy 2:8,) but even by profane authors, who were driven by mere
   instinct to reprove the stupidity of men; if it were not that God
   perhaps forced them to make this confession, in order that true
   religion might never be without some kind of attestation.

   And yet the Prophet does not mean that they were robbers or murderers,
   but reproves the tricks and deceit by which they obtained possession of
   the property of others. God judges in a different manner from men; for
   the hidden tricks and wicked arts, by which wicked men are accustomed
   to deceive and take advantage of the more simple, are not taken into
   account by men; or if they are taken into account, they are at least
   extenuated, and are not estimated according to their just weight. But
   God, dragging forth to light those very men of dazzling reputation, who
   under specious pretenses had been in the habit of concealing their
   unjust practices, plainly declares that they are murderers. For in
   whatever way you kill a man, whether you cut his throat or take away
   his food and the necessaries of life, you are a murderer. Consequently,
   God does not speak of men who are openly wicked, or whose crimes have
   made them openly infamous, but of those who wished to be thought good
   men, and who kept up some kind of reputation.

   This circumstance ought to be carefully observed; for on the same
   grounds must we now deal with wicked men, who oppress the poor and
   feeble by fraud and violence, or some kind of injustice, and yet cloak
   their wickedness by plausible disguise. But with whatever impudence
   they may exclaim that they do not resemble thieves or assassins we must
   reprove them with the same severity which the Prophet employed towards
   persons of the same stamp; for when we speak in the name of God, we
   must not judge according to the views and opinions of men, but must
   boldly declare the judgment which the Lord hath pronounced.

   16. Wash you, make you clean He exhorts the Jews to repentance, and
   points out the true way of it, provided that they wish to have their
   obedience approved by God. Hence we conclude that nothing can please
   God, unless it proceed from a pure conscience; for God does not, like
   men, judge of our works according to their outward appearance. It
   frequently happens that some particular action, though performed by a
   very wicked man, obtains applause among men; but in the Sight of God,
   who beholds the heart, a depraved conscience pollutes every virtue. And
   this is what is taught by Haggai, holding out an illustration drawn
   from the ancient ceremonies, that everything which an unclean person
   has touched is polluted; from which he concludes that nothing clean
   proceeds from the wicked. Our Prophet has already declared, that in
   vain do they offer sacrifices to God, in vain do they pray, in vain do
   they call on his name, if integrity of heart do not sanctify the
   outward worship. For this reason, in order that the Jews may no longer
   labor to no purpose, he demands that cleanness; and he begins with a
   general reformation, lest, after having discharged one part of their
   duty, they should imagine that this would be a veil to conceal them
   from the eyes of God.

   Such is the manner in which we ought always to deal with men who are
   estranged from God. We must not confine our attention to one or a few
   sores of a diseased body but if we aim at a true and thorough cure, we
   must call on them to begin anew, and must thoroughly remove the
   contagion, that they who were formerly hateful and abominable in the
   sight of God may begin to please God. By the metaphor washing, he
   unquestionably exhorts to remove inward pollution, but shortly
   afterwards he will also add the fruits of actions.

   When he bids them wash, he does not mean that men repent by their own
   exercise of free-will; but he shows that there is no other remedy but
   this, that they shall appear pure in the sight of God. Now, we know
   that the sacred writers attribute to men what is wrought in them by the
   Spirit of God, whom Ezekiel calls clean water, because to him belongs
   the work of repentance. (Ezekiel 36:25.)

   Put away the evil of your doings The Prophet now comes to describe the
   fruits of repentance; for not only does he explain without a metaphor
   what it is to wash and to be cleansed, but he enjoins them to exhibit
   in their whole life, and in every action, the evidence of their being
   renewed. Yet he confirms the former statement, that the pollution of
   the people is before the eyes of God, that it stains and debases all
   their actions, and thus makes it impossible that they shall be pleasing
   in his sight. And he particularly mentions the eyes of God, lest, when
   they employed a veil to hinder themselves from seeing, they should
   vainly imagine that God shared with them in their blindness.

   Cease to do evil He still proceeds to reprove their manner of life.
   This passage is commonly interpreted as if by doing ill the Prophet
   meant loving ill; but it ought strictly to be understood as denoting
   those crimes by which a neighbor is injured; so that in the
   exhortation, Learn to do well, which occurs in the next verse, the
   expression to your neighbor ought to be supplied; for he speaks of the
   injuries and kind offices which Eve perform to our neighbors. Now since
   repentance has its seal in the heart of man, he describes it by those
   outward appearances by means of which it is, in some measure, brought
   before the eyes of men. There is no man who does not wish to be
   reckoned a good man; but the true character of every man is manifested
   by his actions. He therefore calls them to the performance of those
   outward actions by which they may give evidence of their repentance.

   He comprehends under two heads the fruits of repentance, ceasing to do
   evil, and doing well. First, we must cease to commit every act of
   injustice; for we must not imitate those spendthrifts who wish to be
   thought bountiful, and fraudulently take from one person what they
   bestow on another. Again, we must not resemble those idle people who
   think that they have done enough, if they have kept themselves from
   doing harm, and from invading the property of their neighbors, but are
   not careful to perform acts of kindness. He intended, therefore, to
   include both; for under those two heads the keeping of the second table
   of the law is comprehended.

   17. Learn to do well As he had just now, ill enjoining them to cease to
   do evil, charged them with the continual practice of iniquity as if he
   had said that their whole life was a constant habit of sinning; so now
   he enjoins them to become skilled in acts of kindness, and in
   entreating them to learn this, he addresses them as scholars who had
   not yet learned their earliest lessons. And first he bids them seek
   judgment. Others render it, inquire respecting judgment, of which I do
   not approve; for by the word seek the Prophet meant more than this, he
   meant what we call the actual practice of it. By the word judgment he
   denotes what is good and right; as if he had said, "Aim at
   uprightness."

   Relieve the oppressed The Prophet, after his wonted manner, adds to the
   general description the mention of particular classes; and although he
   has already given a special exhortation to kindness and justice, yet
   wishing to press them more closely, he enters into a more careful
   enumeration of certain classes, so as to present a more complete view
   of the subject. For otherwise men always wish to be reckoned good and
   righteous, and can scarcely be moved by general instruction; but when
   we come to particular cases, they are forced, as it were, to deal with
   the matter in hand, and are compelled to yield, or at least become more
   tractable, of which we have daily experience.

   Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow The Prophet here selects two
   classes, by means of which the wickedness of men is more fully exposed;
   for it seldom happens that the causes of the fatherless and widows are
   defended, because men do not expect from them any rewards. To such an
   extent are they exposed to every kind of injustice, that no man comes
   forward in defense of them, because there is no man who follows justice
   on its own account; and not only so, but there is a very great number
   of persons who are ready to plunder the poor and needy. This proves
   that there is no one who cares about exercising judgment; for we need
   not at all wonder that men of wealth and influence have friends to
   assist them, who are excited and allured by the expectation of reward.
   But the Lord declares that he takes charge of the fatherless and
   widows, and will avenge them if they shall sustain any injury.

   "Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. If thou afflict
   then in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their
   cry: and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword;
   and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless." (Exodus
   22:22-24.)

   The same declaration is now extended to all others, who are oppressed
   and groan under the violence and lawless passions of men of rank and
   influence.

   This ought to yield the highest consolation to all the children of God,
   who are enjoined to possess their souls in patience. (Luke 21:19.)
   Whatever may be the haughty boasting of enemies, this will not prevent
   the people of God from glorying amidst their tribulations, while such
   considerations as these shall have an abiding place in their minds:
   "The Lord will be our avenger. Though men disregard us, he takes care
   of us. He will aid the destitute, and will defend their cause."

   18. Come now, and let us reason together [24] The Hebrew word n' (na)
   is commonly translated I pray, or therefore; but I think that it
   denotes the confidence of a good cause, and thus is an exhortation,
   Come. For the Lord declares that the Jews will have nothing, to reply,
   and that, even though they obtain an opportunity of clearing
   themselves, they will still be speechless. And certainly this is the
   way in which hypocrites ought to be treated; for they boldly enter into
   disputes with God, and there is no end of their reasonings.
   Accordingly, he tells them that, if they choose to debate, he will be
   equally prepared on the other side.

   The question will perhaps be put, Why does the Prophet speak chiefly
   about the second table of the law, and not rather about the worship of
   God? For we know that there were good reasons why God assigned the
   foremost place to the first table, when he divided the law; and there
   can be no doubt that, as it comes first in order, so it is likewise of
   greater importance. I reply, when the Prophets reprove the hypocrisy of
   men, they employ various modes of address. Sometimes they complain that
   the Sabbath has been profaned; sometimes they say that men do not call
   on God; but for the most part they censure idolatry, and raise their
   voice against superstitions. But here Isaiah complains that their
   duties towards their neighbors have not been performed.

   Still in all these cases the object is the same, to show that our
   actions are of no value in the sight of God, when they do not proceed
   from a good conscience, and when we are destitute of the fear of God.
   This fear they sometimes denote by "calling on the name of God,"
   sometimes by "keeping the Sabbath," and sometimes by other actions; but
   as the distinction between true worship and hypocrisy is most clearly
   and manifestly pointed out by means of the duties of brotherly
   kindness, there are good reasons why the mention of those duties is
   brought forward by Isaiah. For hypocrites are careful to perform
   outward worship and ceremonies; but inwardly they are full of envy,
   they swell with pride and contempt of the brethren, they burn with
   covetousness and ambition; and while they conceal themselves under
   those masks, they cannot easily be detected. They must, therefore, be
   tried by this rule, as by a touchstone, and thus it must be ascertained
   whether or not they fear God.

   We might, indeed, be deceived, were it from the second table only that
   we formed our judgment about the godliness of a man; but if any one
   discharge the duties of the first table, which are evidences of
   godliness and of the worship of God, he must then be brought to this
   standard, Does he act inoffensively towards other men? Does he abstain
   from every act of injustice? Does he speak truth? Does he live in the
   exercise of kindness to his brethren? This is the reason why Christ
   pronounces

   mercy, judgment, and faith, to be the weighty matters of the law,
   (Matthew 23:23,)

   and censures the Pharisees because, in their eagerness about tithes and
   offerings, they attended only to smaller matters, and neglected true
   righteousness. By faith he means fidelity, or what we commonly call
   loyalty. [25] By judgment he means every kind of uprightness, when we
   render to every man what belongs to him, and do not allow others to be
   injured, but assist them, as far as lies in our power.

   But if these are the weighty matters of the law, in what order ought we
   to place the commandments of the second table? I answer, they retain
   their due importance and order; but by means of those duties which
   Christ so rigidly demands, and on which he dwells so largely, hypocrisy
   is more fully detected, and we are better enabled to judge whether a
   man sincerely fears God or not. In the same sense ought we to
   understand that passage, I will have mercy and not sacrifice; (Hosea
   6:6; Matthew 9:13;) for mercy is an evidence and proof of true
   godliness. Again, it is pleasing to God, because it is a true
   demonstration of the love which we owe to our fellow-men; but
   sacrifices are pleasing to him for a different reason. It is now, I
   think, sufficiently plain why the Prophet Isaiah mentions kindness
   rather than faith or calling upon God; and why the prophets employ such
   variety in their modes of address, when they endeavor to bring back
   hypocrites to the true worship of God, and when they bid them show it
   by its fruits.

   Though your sins be as scarlet It is as if he had said, that he does
   not accuse innocent persons, and has no wish to enter into controversy;
   so that the charges which he makes against them are not brought forward
   or maintained without strong necessity. For hypocrites are wont to find
   fault with God, as if he were too severe, and could not be at all
   appeased. They go still farther, and discover this excuse for their
   obstinacy, that it is in vain for them to attempt to return to a state
   of favor with God. If every other expedient fail, still they fly to
   this, that it is not proper to make such rigid demands on them, and
   that even the very best of men have something that needs to be
   forgiven. The Prophet anticipates the objection, by introducing the
   Lord speaking ill this manner -- "For my part, if it be necessary, I do
   not refuse to dispute with you; for the result will be to show that it
   is your own obstinacy which prevents a reconciliation from taking place
   between us. Only bring cleanness of heart, and all controversy between
   us will be at an end. I would no longer contend with you, if you would
   bring me an upright heart."

   Hence we obtain a declaration in the highest degree consolatory, that
   God does not contend with us as if he wished to pursue our offenses to
   the utmost. For if we sincerely turn to him, he will immediately return
   to favor with us, and will blot out all remembrance of our sins, and
   will not demand an account of them. For he is not like men who, even
   for a slight and inconsiderable offense, often refuse to be reconciled.
   Nay, so far is he from giving us reason to complain of his excessive
   severity, that he is ready to cleanse us, and to make us as white as
   snow. He is satisfied With cleanness of heart, and if, notwithstanding
   of this cleanness of heart, there be any offense, he forgives it, and
   acquits those who have provoked him.

   19. If ye be willing and obedient Isaiah continues to plead the cause
   of God against the people, and states in a few words, that not only
   must the people bear the blame of all the calamities which they
   endured, but that it lies in their own power to regain immediately
   prosperity and happiness; because God is always ready to forgive them,
   provided that they do not harden their hearts. But because happiness
   appears here to be placed in the power of men, and at their disposal,
   the papists openly maintain that men, by the exercise of their own
   will, are free to choose either good or evil. When God charges men with
   obstinacy, we must not on that account believe that he describes the
   nature or extent of their ability.

   But it would be useless to say, if ye be willing, unless it were in the
   power of men to will. I answer, though the choice be not so free as
   they pretend that it is, yet sinners are justly chargeable with being
   the voluntary agents of their calamities, because it is of their own
   accord, and not by compulsion, that they provoke God to anger. It is
   therefore true, that it is a special gift of God when a man aims at
   what is good; but it is equally true that it is their own wickedness
   that hinders the reprobate from applying their mind to it, and,
   consequently, that the whole blame of their obstinacy rests with
   themselves. On this depends the reproach brought against the people,
   that they would have led a prosperous and happy life, if they had been
   submissive and obedient to God. For since God is by nature disposed to
   acts of kindness, nothing but our ingratitude and enmity hinders us
   from receiving that goodness which he freely offers to all. On the
   other hand, he adds a sharp and heavy threatening, that it is in his
   power to take vengeance; lest they should imagine that they who despise
   God will escape without punishment. It ought also to be observed, that
   the only rule of living well is to yield obedience to God and his word;
   for to will and to hear mean nothing else than to comply with the will
   of God.

   A change of the construction of the words (hypallage) has been admitted
   into this sentence; for the meaning fully brought out would stand thus:
   "if your mind be ready, and your will be disposed, to obey;" or, which
   amounts to the same thing, "if you render obedience to me, and lend an
   ear to my word." since, therefore, God places the happiness of men in
   obedience, it follows that our life is properly conducted, when we hear
   God speaking, and obey him in all things. How great, therefore, is the
   wickedness of men, when they refuse to listen to God who is continually
   speaking to them, and reject the happiness which he has provided and
   offered! It was proper that their wayward dispositions should be
   subdued, lest those wretched men should draw down on themselves the
   wrath of God, and willingly throw themselves, like wild beasts, on the
   edge of the sword. We must likewise observe, that he at length
   threatens them with final destruction, if they shall obstinately refuse
   to submit themselves to God.

   Ye shall eat the good of the land He means the fruits which the earth
   yields for supplying the necessaries of life; for in some sense the
   earth may be said to be unkind when it does not produce its fruits, and
   keeps them, as it were, in its bosom. Yet I have no doubt he alludes to
   the promises of the law, in which God declares, that to those who fear
   him he will bless the earth and will cause it to produce a great
   abundance of all good things.

   The Lord shall make thee plenteous in the fruit of the ground, in the
   land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers to give thee. (Deuteronomy
   28:11.)

   And yet, when he offers to us the conveniences of the earthly life, it
   is not because he wishes that our attention should be confined to our
   present happiness, which alone hypocrites value, and which entirely
   occupies their minds; but in order that, by the contemplation of it, we
   may rise to the heavenly life, and that, by tasting so much goodness,
   he may prepare us for the enjoyment of eternal happiness. More
   especially was God accustomed to act in this manner towards the ancient
   people, that, by tasting present benefits, as by a shadow, they might
   be called to the heavenly inheritance. This distinction ought to be
   carefully observed, that we may apply this instruction to ourselves,
   according to the degree of prosperity to which God has exalted us. The
   Prophet intended to show that true happiness, with its accompaniments,
   consists in obedience to God; and that the wicked, by their obstinacy,
   bring upon themselves every kind of calamities, and therefore that all
   our distresses ought to be ascribed to the sins and crimes which we
   have committed.

   20. But if ye refuse and rebel The wicked always think that the
   severity of the punishment is greater than their guilt, even though the
   Lord chastise them very gently; and although they do not venture to
   justify themselves entirely, yet they never cease, as I formerly said,
   to accuse God of excessive severity. But the Prophet threatens that
   there will be no end of their calamities till they be destroyed; and
   lest they should imagine that they had nothing more to fear than those
   slight and inconsiderable punishments which they had hitherto suffered,
   he declares that far heavier judgments of God are still awaiting them.

   The papists torture this passage to support the doctrine of freewill,
   and argue in the following manner: -- "If men be happy whenever they
   are willing to obey God, it follows that this is placed in our own
   power." The argument certainly is very childish; for the Lord does not
   inform us by the Prophet what is the nature or extent of our capacity
   for good or evil; but he reminds us that it is our own fault if we do
   not enjoy good things, and that the calamities with which we are
   afflicted are the punishments of our disobedience. The question,
   whether a man can make his bad will good, is altogether different from
   the question, whether, by the bad will, which is natural to him, he
   brings upon himself all the evils which he endures. Unjustly and
   falsely, therefore, do those skillful and ingenious doctors employ this
   passage to support their doctrine about a free choice of good and evil.

   For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it [26] Since men who are blinded
   by their lusts are little moved by threatenings, the Prophet, in order
   to arouse them from deep slothfulness, reminds them that this
   declaration is not uttered by a mortal man, but has proceeded from the
   mouth of God, who is not changeable like men, but adheres constantly to
   his purpose. [27] He therefore mentions the mouth of the Lord, in order
   to terrify them, that they who in their vices have fallen into a deep
   slumber may give earnest attention to his threatenings.

   21. How is the faithful city become an harlot! In order to make the
   rebuke more forcible, and the crime of the people more shocking, in
   having thus departed from God and from all uprightness, he cries aloud
   as if he had seen some monstrous thing; and certainly it was a change
   fitted to awaken horror, that a nation devoted to God, and chosen to a
   royal priesthood, (Exodus 19:6,) had fallen from lofty piety to the
   lowest sink of wickedness. More especially he speaks of the city of
   Jerusalem, which was God's sanctuary and royal abode. He complains that
   the city which had formerly been a guardian of justice is a den of
   robbers; that she who formerly was a chaste and pure virgin hath become
   a harlot, To strike the deeper shame into the degenerate Jews, who had
   departed widely from their holy fathers, he assumes the air of a person
   astonished, and asks himself how this could possibly have happened.

   The faithful city By the word faithful he alludes, in my opinion, to
   the conjugal fidelity which a wife ought to preserve to her husband.
   The signification is undoubtedly more extensive; but when I look at the
   connection of the passage I do not hesitate to say that faithful means
   chaste; for immediately afterwards he employs another term in contrast
   with it, calling her an harlot. Whereas she once was a virtuous wife,
   faithful to the marriage-contract, she has now become an harlot, and
   her base conduct brings not a blush on her countenance. The Scriptures
   frequently call the Church the wife of God. (Hosea 2:19, 20.) That
   honorable rank Jerusalem held, so long as she maintained spiritual
   chastity, and continued in the pure and lawful worship of God; but as
   soon as she departed from it she became an harlot.

   This astonishment of the Prophet was undoubtedly joined with the
   deepest grief; for we ought to look upon it as something monstrous when
   men revolt from God, and refuse that allegiance which they have
   promised to render; nor is it possible that right-hearted men, when
   they behold such a revolt, can fail to be affected with the most
   poignant grief. We read that the angels in heaven rejoice at the
   conversion of one sinner; (Luke 15:7, 10;) and therefore they cannot
   but mourn over the final ruin of any sinner. How much more then will
   they bewail the ruin and destruction of a whole state and Church!

   Besides, that astonishment conveys also a complaint; as if the Prophet
   had said, "O Jerusalem, from what a flourishing condition hast thou
   fallen! Into what distress hast thou plunged thyself! What shame and
   disgrace hast thou brought upon thee!" When the flourishing state in
   which she had been, and the respect that had been paid to her in former
   times, are called to her remembrance, it ought to produce a still
   deeper impression on her mind; for she who was at one time the
   respected mother of a family is naturally more careful about her honor
   and reputation than one who has spent her whole life in base and
   licentious conduct.

   It was full of judgment He shows what fruits were produced by that
   allegiance to God at a former period. We may take judgment as but
   another name for uprightness; or, if it be thought preferable, we may
   call it justice when men render to every man his own, and judgment when
   the cause of the innocent is defended, and the poor and needy are
   avenged; for such is the use of the words in Scripture when they are
   employed together; but as they are not perfectly connected in this
   passage, I consider judgment to denote uprightness; so that the same
   thing is twice expressed for the purpose of explaining it more fully.

   But now murderers He shows in what manner Jerusalem became an harlot.
   It was, that the city, which had formerly been distinguished for the
   love of justice and equity, was now full of murders. The meaning is, as
   we have formerly said, not that they were assassins or robbers, but
   that, by fraudulent and dishonest methods, under the pretense of
   justice, they had gained the property of others. In short, he means
   that they did not act fairly and justly towards their fellow-men,
   whatever might be the estimation in which they were held; for
   sometimes, and indeed very frequently, it happens that very wicked men
   are held in high esteem.

   The condition to which Jerusalem was reduced should lead us to consider
   how often Satan exercises what may be called unbounded tyranny over the
   Church of God; for if ever there was a Church, there was one at that
   time in Jerusalem; and yet Isaiah affirms that it was a den of robbers,
   or a slaughterhouse, where they cut men's throats. But if Satan could
   freely riot in that Church, let us not wonder that the same thing takes
   place among us; but let us labor not to suffer ourselves to be
   corrupted by such wicked examples.

   22. Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water Isaiah speaks
   metaphorically, and by two comparisons shows here, that though the
   outward appearance of affairs was not openly overturned, yet their
   condition was changed and corrupted, so as to be widely different from
   what it had formerly been: for he says that dross now shines instead of
   gold, and that the wine, though it retains its color, has lost its
   flavour. "Though thou still make an empty show," saith the Prophet,
   "yet nothing pure will be found in thee: that wine which was wont to be
   Stare in thee is corrupted; and though its color deceive the eye, its
   taste shows that it has been mixed."

   All this means nothing more than that the Jews should lay aside
   hypocrisy, and should begin to confess their sins, and no longer
   flatter themselves after the manner of hypocrites. The comparisons here
   employed are exceedingly well adapted to this end, for dross bears some
   resemblance to gold; and in like manner, the color of wine mixed with
   water resembles that of pure wine; and yet both are very far from
   having that purity of which they make an outward show. In like manner
   hypocrites, by their hypocrisy, may be said to assume a false color of
   silver, though they are of no more value than dross, and indeed are the
   more detestable on this account, that, though they are exceedingly
   wicked, yet, with not less treachery than baseness, they present to God
   and to men those hollow pretensions by which they cloak their malice.

   23. Thy princes are rebellious There is here an elegant allusion or
   play on words. [28] He does not speak of princes in such a manner as if
   the common people were holy and needed no reproof, but he points out
   the source of the evil; for as no disease is more injurious than that
   which spreads from the head into the whole body, so no evil is more
   destructive in a commonwealth than a wicked and depraved prince, who
   conveys his corruptions into the whole body both by his example and by
   the liberty which he allows. Hence, too, comes the proverb, hopoia he
   despoina, toiai kai hai therapainides, like mistress, like maids. The
   meaning, therefore, is as if the Prophet had said that there was no one
   vice more than another that reigned among the people, but that an
   unbounded commission of crimes prevailed among the nobles themselves,
   and that in this manner the whole body was stained with pollution.
   Something which gives additional force to the statement is implied in
   the word princes; for it is deeply to be lamented when an evil arises
   from that very quarter in which the remedy for it ought to be expected.
   He next mentions a particular instance.

   Companions of thieves By these words he means that they are so far from
   restraining theft and false dealing, that, on the contrary, they draw
   gain from them; and he justly calls those persons companions of
   thieves, who, by receiving part of the booty, grant permission to
   commit theft. And, indeed, when a judge is corrupted by a bribe, it is
   impossible but that crimes shall abound and pass unpunished, with the
   perpetrators of which we must consider him to be in collusion.

   Every one loveth a gift He next points out the reason why princes have
   made themselves companions of thieves, and have bound themselves by a
   wicked conspiracy to lend countenance to crimes. It is avarice. When
   judges are devoted to the love of money, justice is utterly destroyed;
   for if the acceptance of persons be a corruption of judgment, so that
   no room is left for justice, every man who is under the dominion of
   covetousness will assuredly regard the person rather than the cause.
   The consequence is, that he will not be able to perceive what is just
   and right, but, as one expresses it, will make laws and unmake them.

   This reminds us how great a virtue it is in a magistrate to disregard
   money; for unless he keep his mind, his hands, and his eyes under
   restraint, he will never be able to judge justly. It is absurd to say,
   as some men do, that they keep their heart pure and uncorrupted, even
   though they receive bribes. What the Lord saith must be true, that a
   gift blindeth the eyes of the wise, and perverteth the words of the
   righteous. (Exodus 23:8.) No man is so upright, no man is so
   clearsighted and sagacious, that his mind shall resist the enchantment,
   and his eyes the blinding influence, of gifts. Such judges, therefore,
   he justly declares to be companions of thieves; for, hurried along by a
   blind desire of money, they overturn all law both of God and man, and
   leave no room for justice or modesty.

   We must likewise observe that the Prophet, in order to convince
   hypocrites, brings forward their actions which were open and
   universally known; for otherwise they would not submit. And yet there
   can be no doubt that there were at that time many who objected, when he
   thus called them thieves, as even in the present day most men
   impudently and obstinately exclaim that they are not thieves on account
   of receiving the rewards and gifts which are offered to them, because
   their do not prevent them from passing a just judgment. But these
   replies being frivolous, the Prophet, after having exposed their wicked
   actions, satisfies himself with the reproof which he has given, and
   argues with them no longer. And, indeed, nature declares that it is
   impossible to give just judgment, when judges are so eager for gain and
   regard; because they cannot but absolutely expose to sale their honesty
   and reputation.

   They judge not the fatherless As the Lord specially recommends to us
   the fatherless and widows, because they have been deprived of the
   protection of men, so we need not wonder if he is displeased when they
   are abandoned by the judges, who ought to have been their guardians and
   defenders; for since they have neither foresight, nor industry nor
   strength if no one comes forward to render assistance they must be
   exposed without redress to every kind of violence and injustice. Now,
   when no regard is paid to them, it follows that the sway is held, not
   by justice, but by covetousness and plunder.

   24. Therefore saith the lord, the LORD of hosts He first employs the
   word h'dvn, (haadon) which literally signifies lord, and expresses the
   relation to a servant. Next is added the word yhvh (Jehovah,) which
   denotes the eternal essence and majesty of God. After having laid open
   some kinds of crimes, which made it manifest that in that nation
   everything was corrupted, Isaiah, now wishing to threaten and to hold
   out to them the judgment of God, not only represents God as invested
   with the power and authority of a Judge, but at the same time reminds
   them that the children of Abraham are his peculiar people, and for this
   reason he immediately adds, the mighty One of Israel. There may also be
   implied in it a kind of irony, by which he stings the Jews, as if he
   had said that it was foolishness in them to boast of the name of God,
   seeing that they were worthless and unprincipled servants, and that it
   was vain for them to rely on his strength, which would immediately
   break forth against them. After this preface, he adds --

   Ah! I will take consolation on my adversaries [29] By these words he
   intimates that God will not be pacified until he has satiated himself
   with inflicting punishment. He employs the word consolation after the
   manner of men; for as anger is nothing else than the desire of revenge,
   so revenge gives relief to the mind, and he who has taken vengeance
   congratulates himself and is satisfied. By this course, which may be
   regarded as a kind of compensation, the Lord says that he will satisfy
   himself with inflicting punishment on his adversaries

   There are various ways, indeed, of expounding this passage; and I shall
   not undertake the task of examining all the interpretations and
   refuting those which I do not approve: it will be enough if we
   ascertain the true meaning. He does not here speak of Chaldeans or
   Assyrians, as some imagine, but of Jews, to whom, in the character of a
   herald, he proclaims war in the name of the Lord. This threatening
   sounded harshly in their ears; for they supposed that they were joined
   in such a confederacy with God, that he was an adversary to their
   adversaries. He declares, on the other hand, that he is their enemy
   because he had so often been provoked by their crimes. In this manner
   we must shake off the slothfulness of hypocrites, who are continually
   waging war with God, and yet do not hesitate to allege that they enjoy
   his protection. We need not wonder, therefore, if the Prophet sternly
   pronounces them to be adversaries of God, who had broken the covenant,
   and had thus carried on war against him.

   And yet, in order to show that he is unwillingly, as it were,
   constrained to inflict punishment on his people, God utters his
   threatening with a kind of groan. For as nothing is more agreeable to
   his nature than to do good, so whenever he is angry with us and treats
   us harshly, it is certain that our wickedness has compelled him to do
   so, because we do not allow his goodness to take its free course. More
   especially he is disposed to treat his own people with gentleness, and
   when he sees that there is no longer any room for his forbearance, he
   takes measures, as it were in sorrow, for inflicting punishment.

   Some would rather choose perhaps to explain the particle hvy (hoi) as
   of God made this exclamation when aroused by anger. For my own part, I
   rather consider it, in this passage, to be an expression of grief;
   because God, being mindful of his covenant, would willingly spare his
   chosen people, were it not that pardon was entirely prevented by their
   obstinacy.

   And avenge me of mine enemies In this second clause there is a
   reduplication, (anadiplosis) a figure of speech customary with the
   Hebrews, who frequently express the same thing twice in one verse.
   Hence also we learn that the object of the statement is, that God
   cannot rest until he has taken vengeance on a wicked and treacherous
   people

   25. And I will turn my hand upon thee This is an alleviation of the
   former threatening; for though he still proceeds with what he had begun
   to state about his severity, he at the same time declares that, amidst
   those calamities which were to be inflicted, the Church would be
   preserved. But the principal design was to comfort believers, that they
   might not suppose the Church to be utterly ruined, though God treated
   them more roughly than before. The Spirit of God, by the Prophets,
   continually warns the children of God, who always tremble at his word,
   not to be overwhelmed and lose heart on account of terrors and
   threatening; for the more daringly that wicked men practice
   licentiousness and scoff at all threatening the more do those who are
   affected by a sincere fear of God tremble at them.

   Besides, the turning of the hands of God denotes generally a token of
   his presence, as if he should say, I will display my hand. This he is
   wont to do in two ways, either by chastising the wicked, or by
   delivering believers from their distresses. Since, therefore, it is
   evident from the context that God purposes, by applying consolation, to
   mitigate the severity of punishment, the turning of the hands must here
   be viewed as referring to the restoration of the Church; for although
   he declared in general terms that all were his enemies, he now modifies
   or limits that statement by addressing Jerusalem or Zion by name.

   When he adds, I will purge away thy dross, though he points out the
   fruit of correction, that believers may not be immoderately grieved or
   distressed on account of it, yet we learn from this expression that the
   purification of the Church is God's own work. For this purpose he
   always lifts up his hand to punish transgressions, that he may bring
   back wanderers into the road; but rods would be of no avail, if he did
   not make them useful by touching their hearts inwardly. And, indeed,
   since he points out here a special favor which he bestows on his elect,
   it follows from this that repentance is a true and peculiar work of the
   Holy Spirit; for otherwise the sinner, instead of profiting in the
   smallest degree, would be more and more hardened by chastisements.

   The pure purging, so that no dross remains, must not, however, be
   understood as if God ever cleansed his Church entirely in this world
   from every stain, but must be regarded as spoken after the manner of
   men; as if he said that the condition of his Church will be such that
   her holiness will shine like pure silver. These words, therefore,
   indicate real purity, for the Jews had formerly been too well satisfied
   with their filthiness. This is a highly appropriate comparison, by
   which the Prophet declares, that though the Church was at that time
   polluted by many defilements, still some remnant would be left, which,
   after the removal of the pollution, would regain its brightness. In
   this manner he also connects both clauses; for when he formerly spoke
   of their crimes, he said that their silver had become dross. (Isaiah
   1:22.)

   26. And I will restore thy judges as at the first He now speaks without
   a figure; and having said that the source and origin of the evils was
   in the princes, he shows that a divine hand will purify that rank, when
   the Lord shall be pleased to restore the Church to perfect health. And,
   indeed, when they who rule are good and holy men, public order is
   maintained; for when wicked men have power, everything goes to ruin. By
   judges and counsellors are evidently meant any kind of magistrates; and
   when he promises that they will be such as they were at the beginning,
   he brings to their remembrance the extraordinary goodness of God, of
   which they had been deprived. God had graciously raised up the throne
   of David, and in that government was pleased to give a bright
   resemblance of his own parental love. Though the authority of the
   family of David had degenerated into the grossest tyranny, yet they
   continued to boast of a false title; for they still vaunted of the
   reign of David in the same manner as the papists of the present day
   plume themselves on a false pretense of the Church. Justly, therefore,
   are the people reminded of the happiness from which they had fallen by
   their own fault, that they might not be displeased at a diminution of
   their numbers, by means of which they would again possess that order
   which God had established

   Then shalt thou be called He describes the fruit of that reformation,
   of which he has spoken, as extending to the whole body; for, having
   said that Jerusalem, before she revolted from God, was a faithful city,
   full of righteousness, the Prophet now says, that when she shall have
   been chastised the same virtues will be illustriously displayed in her.
   Here, too, is expressed the sum of true repentance; for by
   righteousness is meant uprightness, when every man obtains what belongs
   to him, and men live with each other without committing injury. The
   word faithful has a still more extensive meaning; for when a city is
   called faithful, it means not only that justice and honesty between man
   and man are observed, but that the purity of God's worship is
   maintained and therefore the chastity and purity of the mind are
   included under that designation.

   It must also be observed, however, that from this faithfulness springs
   justice; for when we adhere to truth in our mutual intercourse, justice
   easily gains the ascendency. And, indeed, when I closely examine the
   whole passage, I think that the Prophet now employs the word
   faithfulness in a more limited sense than formerly, and connects the
   two virtues as leading to the same object, so that, while truth goes
   first as the cause, justice is the effect of it. Isaiah promises not
   only that she will be righteous and faithful, but that she will also be
   distinguished by these commendations; by which he means that the
   knowledge or reputation of it will be everywhere diffused. We know that
   hypocrites, too, are adorned with honorable titles; but Isaiah, having
   introduced God as speaking, takes for granted that the city will
   actually be righteous, as it is foretold that she shall be. In the
   meantime, as I have said, he describes the fruit of a true conversion;
   as if he had said," When Jerusalem shall be brought Jack to true
   godliness, men will be persuaded that she is renewed."

   27. Zion shall be redeemed with judgment He confirms the same doctrine;
   and because the restoration of the Church was hard to be believed, he
   shows that it does not depend on the will of men, but is founded on the
   justice and judgment of God; as if he had said, that God will by no
   means permit his Church to be altogether destroyed, because he is
   righteous. The design of the Prophet, therefore, is to withdraw the
   minds of the godly from earthly thoughts, that in looking for the
   safety of the Church they may depend entirely on God, and not cease to
   entertain good hopes, although instead of aids they should see nothing
   but obstructions. It is a great mistake to consider justice and
   judgment to refer to the Church, as if Isaiah were speaking about the
   well-ordered condition of a city; for the plain meaning is what I have
   stated, that though men yield no assistance, the justice of God is
   fully sufficient for redeeming his Church. And, indeed, so long as we
   look at ourselves, what hope are we entitled to cherish? How many
   things, on the contrary, immediately present themselves that are fitted
   to weaken our faith! It is only in the justice of God that we shall
   find solid and lasting ground of confidence.

   And they that return to her [30] This second clause points out the
   manner of their deliverance; namely that the exiles, who had been
   widely dispersed, will again be gathered together.

   28. And the destruction of the transgressors Lest hypocrites should
   imagine that any fruit of these promises belongs to them, and should
   indulge in vain boasting, he threatens that they shall perish, though
   God redeem his Church. For hypocrites have always been mingled with the
   Church, and indeed are connected with it in the closest manner; but
   they form their estimation of it from outward show. All that God
   promises they at once apply confidently to themselves. The apostle
   tears from them this trust, if indeed it deserve the name of trust,
   which springs from pride and the arrogance of a haughty mind. Here we
   ought to observe how great wisdom is needed by godly teachers, that,
   while they terrify the wicked by the judgment of God, they may at the
   same time support good men, and strengthen them by some consolation,
   that they may not be cast down and discouraged. On the other hand, when
   believers are encouraged be the promise of God, and when wicked men
   falsely apply it to themselves, and puff up their minds with vain
   confidence, the method and course which we ought to pursue is, that we
   neither give occasion to wicked men to become proud, nor depress and
   discourage the minds of the godly; as Isaiah does in this passage. For
   while he speaks of the redemption of the Church, he at the same time
   threatens that sinners, that is, wicked men, shall be destroyed, that
   they may not suppose that these acts of God's kindness belong at all to
   them.

   And yet, while he pronounces destruction against the wicked, by this
   comparison he exhibits more fully the favor of God towards believers,
   which is far more distinctly seen, when God allows the reprobate to
   perish, but preserves his own in safety, as it is said,

   A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand;
   but it shall not come nigh thee. Psalm 91:7.

   Besides, he mitigates the grief and anguish which the diminution of the
   numbers of the Church might produce in godly minds; for he shows that
   there is no other way of imparting health to the whole body than by
   removing its corruption.

   29. For (or, that is) they shall be ashamed In the Hebrew the particle
   ky(ki) is employed, which properly denotes a cause, but frequently also
   denotes exposition. Now, since the Prophet does not here state anything
   new, but only explains the cause of the destruction which awaited the
   ungodly, to render ky (ki) by that is, appears to connect it better
   with the preceding word, klh, (kalah,) consumed, They shall be
   consumed, that is, they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have
   desired; as if the Prophet had said that no evil will be more
   destructive to them than their own superstition. The idols, says he,
   which you call upon for your protection and safety will rather bring
   destruction upon you.

   The word 'lym, (elim,) oaks, [31] has been sometimes rendered Gods;
   [32] but this meaning is set aside by the context; for immediately
   afterwards he adds the word groves: Ye shall be ashamed of the groves
   which you have chosen. Now, under the image both of trees and of
   groves, the Prophet, by a figure of speech, in which a part is taken
   for the whole, reproves every kind of false worship; for although among
   the Jews there were many forms of idolatry, the custom here mentioned,
   of choosing groves and forests for offering sacrifices, was the most
   common of all. Whether the word gnvt (gannoth) in the second clause be
   translated groves or gardens, there can be no doubt that it means the
   altars and sacred buildings in which they performed their idolatrous
   worship. Although they did not intend openly to revolt from God, they
   invented new kinds of worship; and, as if one place had been more
   acceptable to God than another, they devoted it to his service, as we
   see done by the papists. Next follows a change of the person; for, in
   order to make the reproof more severe, those wicked men of whom he
   spoke in the third person are now directly addressed, Ye shall be
   ashamed

   Which you have desired By the word desired he reproves the mad and
   burning eagerness with which wicked men follow their superstitions.
   They ought to have been earnestly devoted with their whole heart to the
   service of one Gods but they rush with blind violence to false worship,
   as if they were driven by brutish lust. In almost every human mind
   there naturally exists this disease, that they have forsaken the true
   God, and run mad in following idols; and hence Scripture frequently
   compares this madness to the loves of harlots, who shake off shame, as
   well as reason.

   For the gardens that ye have chosen That the Prophet describes not only
   their excessive zeal, but their presumption, in corrupting the worship
   of God, is evident from this second clause, in which he says that they
   chose gardens, for this term is contrasted with the injunction of the
   law. Whatever may be the plausible appearances under which unbelievers
   endeavor to cloak their superstitions, still this saying remains true,
   that obedience is better than all sacrifices. (1 Samuel 15:22.)
   Accordingly, under the term willworship (ethelothreskeia) Paul includes
   (Colossians 2:23) all kinds of false worship which men contrive for
   themselves without the command of God. On this account God complains
   that the Jews have despised his word, and have delighted themselves
   with their own inventions; as if he had said, "It was your duty to
   obey, but you wished to have an unfettered choice, or rather an
   unbounded liberty."

   This single consideration is sufficient to condemn the inventions of
   men, that they have it not in their power to choose the manner of
   worshipping God, because to him alone belongs the right to command. God
   had at that time enjoined that sacrifices should not be offered to him
   anywhere else than at Jerusalem (Deuteronomy 12:13); the Jews thought
   that they pleased him in other places, and that false imagination
   deceived also the heathen nations. Would that it had gone no farther!
   But we see how the papists are involved in the same error, and, in
   short, experience shows that the disease has prevailed extensively in
   every age.

   If it be objected that there was not so much importance in the place,
   that God ought to have regarded with such strong abhorrence the worship
   which was everywhere offered to him, -- first, we ought to consider the
   reason why God chose that at that time there should be only one altar,
   which was, that it might be a bond of holy unity to an uncivilized
   nation, and that by means of it their religion might continue
   unchanged. Besides, granting that this spiritual reason were but of
   temporary force, we must hold by the principle that commandments were
   given in the smallest matters, that the Jews might be better trained to
   obedience; for since superstition conceals itself under the pretense of
   devotion, it is hardly possible but that men will flatter themselves
   with their own inventions. But since obedience is the mother of true
   religion, it follows that when men exercise their own fancy, it becomes
   the source of all superstitions.

   It must also be added, that as Isaiah formerly complained of those
   crimes which were contrary to brotherly love and to the second table of
   the law, so he now complains of their having transgressed the first
   table. For since the whole perfection of righteousness consists in
   keeping the law, when the Prophets wish to reprove men for their sins,
   they speak sometimes of the first, and sometimes of the second, table
   of the law. But we ought always to observe the figurative mode of
   expression, when under one class they include the whole.

   30. Ye shall certainly be [33] as an oak whose leaf fadeth The Hebrew
   particle ky (ki) may be taken in an affirmative sense, as I have
   translated it; and the Prophet appears to allude to those groves to
   which they had improperly restricted the worship of God; for, having
   mentioned gardens, he reproaches them with the confidence which they
   placed in theme and threatens drought. "You take pleasure," says he,
   "in your gardens and trees, but you shall be like withered trees that
   have lost their foliage." God therefore mocks the vain boasting of
   idolaters, who marvellously flatter themselves with their contrivances,
   and think that heaven is open to them, when they are employed in their
   ceremonies. Just as at the present day, when the papists have lighted
   their lamps and adorned their temples, when they dazzle with gold and
   precious stones, when they have played on their organs and rung their
   bells, they imagine that they are the happiest of all men, as if there
   were now no reason to dread that any evil should come to them from God,
   who had received from them a hundredfold satisfaction.

   31. And your God [34] shall be as tow The Hebrew word chsn (chason)
   signifies strong: and though it is here applied to God, still it
   retains its signification, as if he had said, "That god who was your
   strength shall be turned into stubble."

   And the maker of it By the maker he means the carver; but as he
   mentions an idol, we must explain it agreeably to the matter in hand.
   Some think that he expresses the repentance of idolaters, by telling us
   that they would acknowledge their folly, and, being covered with shame,
   would burn their idols. But I consider the meaning to be different; for
   as a fire is made of dry fuel such as tow, "in like manner," saith the
   Prophet," gather you and your idols into one heap, as when a pile of
   wood is built up, that you may be consumed together, so that the idols
   may be like tow, and the men like fire, and that one conflagration may
   consume the whole."

   And there shall be none to quench them It ought to be observed that the
   Prophets, when they mention the wrath of God, describe it by outward
   representations, because it cannot be perceived by the eyes or by any
   other sense. Thus the wrath of God, by which the ungodly are destroyed,
   is compared to fire, which consumes all things. It is now evident
   enough what the Prophet means, namely, that all the ungodly shall be
   destroyed, whatever may be the nature of their confidence; and not only
   so, but that their destruction shall be the greater, because they have
   placed their confidence in false and deceitful things, and that utter
   destruction will overtake them from that very quarter from which they
   had vainly looked for deliverance. For the images and idols are
   excitements of the wrath of God, kindling it into a flame which cannot
   be quenched.

   [9] Enutrire.

   [10] Tollere liberos.

   [11] Our Author, in his Latin version of the Prophet, ([4]see p. 33,)
   has rendered this word by "scelerate egerunt in me" -- "they have acted
   wickedly towards me;" and, in the margin, by "rebellarunt contra me,"
   -- "have rebelled against me." Without taking notice of either of these
   translations, he has here introduced a third, "defecerunt" -- "have
   revolted," for which it would be easy to produce authorities. The
   participle, phvsym (poshegnim,) at Hosea 14:10, is defined by Aben Ezra
   (quoted by Buxtorff) to mean syvts'ym mhrsvt, (sheyotzeim meharshoth,)
   those who withdraw from authority, who set at nought, or oppose, the
   authority of a lawful magistrate. -- Ed

   [12] Spreverunt.

   [13] Israel de me ouk egno, kai ho laos me ou sunoken -- But Israel
   doth not know me, and the people doth not understand me

   [15] Vigerus remarks, that paides, when construed with the genitives of
   nouns, denoting artists, nations, or any particular condition or
   profession of men, is put for the nouns themselves; and he adduces the
   following instances, rhetoron, iatron philosophon, grapheon paides,
   which is far more elegant than rhe'tores etc.; and in like manner,
   Kelton paides, sons of the Celts, or, Gauls, that is, Gauls; dustenon
   paides, sons of the wretched, that is, the wretched -- Ed

   [16] Our Author, quoting from memory, has mingled two passages: And
   now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear
   the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to
   serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul?
   (Deuteronomy 10:12.) Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou
   serve, and to him shalt thou cleave and swear by his name. (Deuteronomy
   10:20.) -- Ed.

   [17] A quel propos? Pour quelle fin?

   [18] In the English version it runs, as overthrown by strangers; and
   the marginal reading, adhering more closely to the Hebrew idiom, is, as
   the overthrow of strangers. The interpretation rejected by Calvin has
   been approved by some able critics; and Lowth, distrusting the
   philological views given by his predecessors, has resorted to a
   conjectural alteration of the Hebrew text: -- "This reading, though
   confirmed by all the ancient versions, gives us no good sense; for your
   land is devoured by strangers, and is desolate as if overthrown by
   strangers, is a mere tautology, or, what is as bad, an identical
   comparison. Aben Ezra thought that the word, in its present form, might
   be taken for the same with zrm, an inundation. Schultens is of the same
   opinion, (see Taylor's Concord;) and Schindler, in his Lexicon,
   explains it in the same manner, and so, says Kimchi, some explain it."
   After enumerating the attempts of Abendana "to reconcile it to
   grammatical analogy," he adds, "but I rather suppose the true reading
   to be zrm, and have translated it accordingly: the word zrym, in the
   line above, seems to have caught the transcriber's eye, and to have led
   him into this mistake." -- Notes on Isaiah. -- Ed

   [20] Residua manebit.

   [21] A lively French traveler, Tavernier, who flourished about the
   middle of the seventeenth century, in describing the eastern shores of
   the Mediterranean Sea, gives the following account: -- "There we see
   large beds of melons and of cucumbers, but especially of the latter, of
   which the inhabitants of the Levant are particularly fond. Most
   frequently they eat them without peeling, and afterwards drink a glass
   of water. Throughout the whole of Asia this is the ordinary food of the
   common people for three or four months. The whole family lives on it;
   and when a child asks for something to eat, instead of giving it bread,
   as in France and other places is the custom, in the Levant they offer
   it a cucumber, which it eats raw just as it has been fresh pulled.
   Cucumbers in the Levant have a peculiarly excellent flavour, and though
   they are eaten raw they never do any injury." -- Ed.

   [22] Poedagogia. In what sense our Author uses this term may be
   gathered from his [5]Commentary on Galatians 3:24. The law was our
   schoolmaster (paidagogos) to Christ. -- Ed

   [23] Our Author seems to allude to Isaiah 65:24, It shall come to pass
   that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking,
   I will hear. This conjecture is confirmed by the [6]remarks which
   immediately follow on the word call, as the leading word in the
   passage. It appears to have escaped his recollection, that in this
   instance the spreading forth of the hands is not mentioned, though it
   occurs in an analogous passage of Solomon's prayer at the dedication of
   the temple -- What prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of
   any man, when he shall spread forth his hands in this house; then hear
   thou from heaven thy dwelling-place. 2 Chronicles 6:29, 30. -- Ed.

   [27] "For Jehovah hath spoken, who fulfills his threatening as well as
   his promises, and does not rashly recall what he hath spoken." --

   [28] Our author illustrates it by the alliteration of primi pravi. "The
   word svrrym (sorerim) is here equivalent," says Jarchi, "to srym,
   (sarim,) that is, persons departing from the right path." "In this word
   svrrym, (sorerim,)" says his annotator Breithaupt, which our
   Commentator here explains by srym, (sarim,) departers, "there is an
   allusion to the word srym, (princes,) which we here find in the sacred
   text." -- Ed

   Isaiah Chapter 2:1-22

   1. The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
   Jerusalem.

   1. Verbum quod vidit Isaias, filius Amos super Iuda et Ierusalem.

   2. And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the
   Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and
   shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.

   2. Et accidet in novissimo dierum, ut statuatur mons domus Iehovae in
   verticem montium, et erigatur supra omnes colles; et fluent ad eum
   omnes gentes.

   3. And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
   mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will
   teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion
   shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

   3. Et venient populi multi, ac dicent, Venite, et ascendemus in montem
   Iehovae, in domum Dei Iacob. Et instituet nos in viis suis, et
   ambulabimus in semitis ejus. Quoniam e Zion exibit lex, et verbum
   Domini e Ierusalem.

   4. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people;
   and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears
   into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
   neither shall they learn war any more.

   4. Et judicabit inter gentes, arguetque populos multos: et concident
   gladios suos in ligones, et lanceas suas in falces: nec levabit gens in
   gentem gladium, nec consuescent ultra praelio.

   5. O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.

   5. Domus Iacob, venite, et ambulabimus in lumine Domini.

   6. Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because
   they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the
   Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.

   6. Certe deseruisti populum tuum, domum Iacob: eo quod impleti sint
   Oriente, (vel, antiquitate,) et auguribus, ut Philistaei: atque in
   filiis alienis acquieverint.

   7. Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end
   of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there
   any end of their chariots:

   7. Impletur est terra ejus argento et auro; nec finis thesauris ejus.
   Equis quoque repleta est terra ejus, nec quadrigis ejus finis.

   8. Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own
   hands, that which their own fingers have made:

   8. Impleta est etiam terra ejus idolis: et coram opere manuum suorum se
   incurvarunt, coram eo quod fixerunt digiti ipsorum.

   9. And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself:
   therefore forgive them not.

   9. Et inclinatus est homo, et humiliatus est vir: ideo, ne remittas,
   (vel, non remittes.)

   10. Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the
   LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.

   10. Ingredere in petram, abscondere in pulvere a conspectu pavoris
   Domini, et gloria magnificentiae ejus.

   11. The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men
   shall be bowed down; and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.

   11. Sublimitas oculorum hominis humiliabitur, et incurvabitur altitudo
   hominum, et exaltabitur Iehova solus in die illa.

   12. For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is
   proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be
   brought low:

   12. Quoniam dies Iehovae exercituum super omnem superbum et excelsum,
   et super omne elevatum, et humile erit.

   13. And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
   and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

   13. Super omnes, inquam, cedros Libani sublimes et elevatos, super
   omnes quercus Basan,

   14. And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are
   lifted up,

   14. Et super omnes montes excelsos, et super omnes colles elevatos,

   15. And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

   15. Et super omnem turrim excelsam, et super omnem murum munitum,

   16. And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.

   16. Super omnes naves Tharsis, et super exquisitas picturas.

   17. And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness
   of men shall be made low; and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that
   day.

   17. Et incurvabitur celsitudo hominis, et humiliabitur altitudo
   hominum, et exaltabitur Iehova solus in die illa.

   18. And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

   18. Idola autem in universum abolebit.

   19. And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves
   of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty,
   when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

   19. Et ingredientur in cavernas petrarum, et in voragines terrae, a
   praesentia terroris Iehovae et gloria majestatis ejus: cum surrexerit
   ut concutiat terram.

   20. In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of
   gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and
   to the bats;

   20. In die illa projiciet homo idola sua argentea, et idola sua aurea,
   quae fecerunt ei ad adorandum, in cavernam talparum et vespertilionum;

   21. To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged
   rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he
   ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

   21. Et ingredientur in scissuras petrarum, et cacumina saxorum, a facie
   pavoris Iehovae et gloria majestatis ejus, cum surrexerit ut concutiat
   terram.

   22. Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is
   he to be accounted of?

   22. Cessate igitur ab homine cujus in nare spiritus; qua enim in re
   (vel, ad quid, vel, quanti) ipse reputatur?


   1. The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw This prophecy is a
   confirmation of that doctrine which we had a little before, concerning
   the restoration of the Church. For since it is difficult to cherish the
   hope of safety, when we are, as it were, in the midst of destruction,
   while the wrath of God burns and consumes everything far and wide, or
   while his threatenings strike terror into our minds, at such a period
   the bare promises are hardly sufficient to support us and to allay our
   fears. For this reason the Lord determined that to the consolation
   which had already been proclaimed there should be added this special
   vision, by way of confirmation, in order to make it more certain and
   undoubted that, whatever calamities might arise, his Church would never
   perish. I have no doubt, therefore, but that this vision agrees with
   what is stated in the 26th and 27th verses of the former chapter.

   Hence we learn what was the advantage and design of visions; for since
   doctrine sometimes has not sufficient weight with us, God therefore
   adds visions, that by means of them he may seal his doctrine to us.
   Since, therefore, this vision is connected with the former promise, we
   learn from it this useful doctrine, that all visions of every kind
   which God formerly gave to his Prophets must be joined to the promises
   in such a manner as to be seals of them. And thus we perceive more and
   more the astonishing goodness of God, that, not satisfied with giving
   us his bare word, he places before our eyes, as it were,
   representations of the events.

   He has added a confirmation, that the restoration of the Church is a
   matter of very great importance, and necessary to be known. For where
   is the truth of the Lord, where is faith, if there be no Church? If
   there be none, it follows that God is a liar, and that everything
   contained in his word is false. But as God frequently shows, by
   striking proofs, that he preserves the Church by unknown methods and
   without the assistance of men, so he now declares by a remarkable
   prediction that he will do this.

   There were two purposes to be served by this prediction. First, since
   Isaiah, and others who came after him, were unceasingly to proclaim
   terror, on account of the obstinate wickedness of the people, until the
   temple should be burnt, and the city destroyed, and the Jews carried
   into captivity, it was necessary that such severity should be mitigated
   towards believers by some consolation of hope. Secondly, as they were
   to languish in captivity, and as their minds were shaken, even after
   their return, by a succession of varied calamities, and at length were
   almost overwhelmed with despair by the dreadful desolation and
   confusion, they might a hundred times have fainted, if they had not
   been upheld. As to those who had already fallen, they were raised up
   and confirmed by the promised restoration, to such an extent, at least,
   that they retained among them the practice of calling on God, which is
   the only and undoubted remedy for the worst of evils. hdvr, (haddabar,)
   the word, is rendered by some interpreters the thing, which accords
   with the general signification of this term; but it is better to view
   it as denoting a divine purpose. Isaiah says that it was revealed to
   him by a special vision.

   2. And it shall come to pass in the last of the days [35] When he
   mentions the end or completion of days, let us remember that he is
   speaking of the kingdom of Christ; and we ought also to understand why
   he gives to the kingdom of Christ this appellation. It was because till
   that time everything might be said to be in a state of suspense, that
   the people might not fix their eyes on the present condition of things,
   which was only a shadow, but on the Redeemer, by whom the reality would
   be declared. Since Christ came, therefore, if that time be compared
   with ours, we have actually arrived at the end of ages. It was the duty
   of the fathers who lived at that time to go, as it were, with
   outstretched arms to Christ; and since the restoration of all things
   depended on his coming, it is with good reason that they are enjoined
   to extend their hope to that period. It was indeed always useful for
   them to know, that under Christ the condition of the Church would be
   more perfect; more especially because they were held under figures, for
   the Lord was pleased to arouse them in various wavy for the express
   purpose of keeping them in suspense.

   But there was a peculiar importance attached to this prediction; for,
   during four hundred years or thereby, there were innumerable occasions
   on which they might have fainted, had they not called to remembrance
   that fullness of days, in which the Church was to be perfectly
   restored. During the various storms, therefore, by which the Church was
   nearly overwhelmed, every believer, when shipwrecked, seized on this
   word as a plank, that by means of it he might be floated into the
   harbour. Yet it ought to be observed, that while the fullness of days
   began at the coming of Christ, it flows on in uninterrupted progress
   until he appear the second time for our salvation. (Hebrews 9:28.)

   That the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established This vision
   might be thought to wear the aspect of absurdity, not only because Zion
   was a little hill of no extraordinary height, just as if one should
   compare a handful of earth to huge mountains; but because he had but a
   little before predicted its destruction. How, then, could it be
   believed that Mount Zion, after having lost all her greatness, would
   again shine with such lustre as to draw upon her the eyes of all the
   nations? And yet she is extolled as if she hail been loftier than
   Olympus." Let the Gentiles," says Isaiah, "boast as much as they please
   of their lofty mountains; for they shall be nothing in comparison of
   that hill, though it be low and inconsiderable." According to nature,
   this certainly was very improbable. What! shall Zion be hung up in the
   clouds? And therefore there can be no doubt that wicked men scoffed at
   this prediction; for ungodliness has always been ready to break forth
   against God.

   Now the peculiarity which I have noticed tended to weaken the belief of
   this prediction; for when Zion, after the destruction of the temple,
   had fallen into the deepest disgrace, how could she rise again so
   suddenly? And yet it was not in vain that Isaiah prophesied; for at
   length this hill was actually raised above all the mountains, because
   from it was heard the voice of God, and sounded through the whole
   world, that it might lift us up to heaven; because from it the heavenly
   majesty of God shone brightly; and lastly, because, being the sanctuary
   of God, it surpassed the whole world in lofty excellence.

   The use of this prophecy deserves our attention. It was, that Isaiah
   intended to bring consolation, which would support the minds of the
   people during the captivity; so that, although there should be no
   temple, and no sacrifices, and though all should be in ruins, still
   this hope would be cherished in the minds of the godly, and, amidst a
   condition so desolate and so shockingly ruinous, they would still
   reason thus: "The mountain of the Lord is indeed forsaken, but there he
   will yet have his habitation; and greater shall be the glory of this
   mountain than of all others." To prevent them, therefore, from doubting
   that such would be the result, the Prophet has here, as it were,
   sketched a picture in which they might behold the glory of God; for
   although the mountain was still in existence, yet a disgraceful
   solitude made it almost an object of detestation, since it had lost its
   splendor in consequence of having been forsaken by God. But it was the
   duty of the pious to look not at those ruins, but at this vision.
   Moreover, the reason why he speaks in such lofty terms concerning the
   exaltation of Mount Zion is sufficiently evident from what follows;
   because thence proceeded the Gospel, in which the image of God shines.
   Other mountains might excel it in height; but as the glory of God has
   surpassing excellence, so the mountain in which he is manifested must
   also be highly distinguished. It was not, therefore, on her own account
   that he extolled Mount Zion, but in respect of her ornament, the
   splendor of which would be communicated to the whole world.

   3. And many people shall go In the former verse he had slightly noticed
   the reason why Mount Zion would hold so high a rank. It was because all
   nations would flow to it, as if the rivers were overflowing through the
   great abundance of waters. He now makes the same statement, and assigns
   the reason; for it might be asked why various nations flocked to it in
   crowds from distant lands. He says, therefore, that the desire of
   serving God was their motive.

   The word rvym, (rabbim,) many, implies a contrast; for it means that
   there will not be, as formerly, but one nation which devotes itself to
   the worship of the true God, but that those who formerly were strangers
   and foreigners (Ephesians 2:19) will come into the same agreement with
   them about religion; as if he had said that the Church, which had
   formerly been, as it were, shut up in a corner, would now be collected
   from every quarter. By the word many he meant various; for
   unquestionably he did not intend to weaken the force of what he had
   said a little before about all nations. Now, though this was never
   fulfilled, that the nations of the whole world, each of them leaving
   their native country, made a journey into Judea; yet, because the
   doctrine of the gospel, by which God hath gathered to himself a Church
   indiscriminately out of all nations, proceeded from Mount Zion, he
   justly says that they will come to it who having, with one consent of
   faith, embraced the covenant of eternal salvation, have been united
   into one Church. We must also observe the harmony between the figures
   of the law and that spiritual worship which began to be introduced at
   the coming of Christ.

   And shall say, Come By these words he first declares that the godly
   will be filled with such an ardent desire to spread the doctrines of
   religion, that every one not satisfied with his own calling and his
   personal knowledge will desire to draw others along with him. And
   indeed nothing could be more inconsistent with the nature of faith than
   that deadness which would lead a man to disregard his brethren, and to
   keep the light of knowledge choked up within his own breast. The
   greater the eminence above others which any man has received from his
   calling so much the more diligently ought he to labor to enlighten
   others.

   This points out to us also the ordinary method of collecting a Church,
   which is, by the outward voice of men; for though God might bring each
   person to himself by a secret influence, yet he employs the agency of
   men, that he may awaken in them an anxiety about the salvation of each
   other. By this method he likewise strengthens their mutual attachment,
   and puts to the test their willingness to receive instruction, when
   every one permits himself to be taught by others.

   Next Isaiah shows that those who take upon them the office of teaching
   and exhorting should not sit down and command others, but should join
   and walk along with them as companions; as we see that some men are
   very severe instructors, and eager to urge others forward, who yet do
   not move a step. But here believers, instead of addressing to their
   brethren the command, Go up, rather lead the way by their own example.
   This is the true method, therefore, of profitable teaching, when, by
   actually performing what we demand, we make it evident that we speak
   with sincerity and earnestness.

   And he will teach us in his ways [36] He shows, first, that God cannot
   be worshipped aright until we have been enlightened by doctrine; and,
   secondly, that God is the only teacher of the Church, on whose lips we
   ought to hang. Hence it follows that nothing is less acceptable to God
   than certain foolish and erring services which men call devotion and
   likewise, that though he employs the agency of men in teaching, still
   he reserves this as his own right, that they must utter nothing but his
   word. Had this rule been followed by those who called themselves
   teachers of the Church religion would not have been so shamefully
   corrupted by a wide and confused diversity of superstitions. Nor is it
   possible that we shall not be carried away into various errors, where
   we are tossed about by the opinions of men. Justly therefore, does
   Isaiah, when he claims for God alone the power and authority to teach
   the Church, shut the mouths of all mortals; so that the office of
   teaching is committed to pastors for no other purpose than that God
   alone may be heard there. Let those who wish to be reckoned ministers
   of Christ allow themselves to be regulated by this statement, that they
   may take nothing away from his authority.

   The Hebrew words vyvrnv mdrkyv (veyorenu midderachaiv) may be literally
   rendered, he will teach us OF his ways; which means, "He will show us
   what his ways are," or, he will set before us his ways for a perfect
   instruction.

   Next he adds obedience, we will walk in his paths, by which he points
   out both the object and the result; for the instruction which is
   delivered to us from the mouth of the Lord is not mere speculation, but
   directs the course of our life, and leads us to obey him. But we ought
   also to observe, that the commandments of God are called ways and
   paths, in order to inform us that they go miserably astray who turn
   aside from them in the smallest degree. Thus every kind of unlawful
   liberty is restrained, and all men, from the least even to the
   greatest, are enjoined to observe this rule of obedience, that they
   keep themselves within the limits of the word of God.

   For out of Zion shalt go forth the law This is an explanation of the
   former verse, in which he said that Mount Zion will be placed above all
   mountains; that is, that she will be raised to the highest pitch of
   honor, when she shall become the fountain of saving doctrine, which
   shall flow out over the whole world. He calls it the law; but we have
   elsewhere spoken of the derivation and meaning of this word; for tvrh
   (torah) means instruction, and the most complete of all kinds of
   instruction is contained in the law. He speaks, therefore, after the
   manner of the prophets; for since the rule of godliness was to be
   obtained from the law, they were wont, by a figure of speech,
   (synecdoche,) in which a part is taken for the whole, to include under
   the word law all the instruction which God has given; just as under the
   word altar they include the whole worship of God.

   Now, since we know that this prediction was fulfilled, when the
   preaching of the gospel began at that very place, (for Christ first
   taught at Jerusalem, and afterwards his doctrine was spread throughout
   the whole world,) we must not take the word law in a limited sense; for
   at that time, as to its figures and bondage, it was rather abolished.
   (Luke 2:46; Mark 16:10; Ezekiel 47:1; Luke 24:47.) Hence we conclude
   that the term is applied, without limitation, to the word of God. And
   when the prophets say that waters will spring out of the temple to
   water the whole world, (Ezekiel 47:1,) they express metaphorically what
   Isaiah lays down in plain language; namely, that the source of saving
   doctrine will be from that place; for out of it the apostles and other
   teachers spread the gospel through the whole world.

   We must observe the reason why the Prophet made these statements. It
   was, that he might fortify the godly against various changes, which
   otherwise, on manifold occasions, might have crushed their minds; and
   therefore it was of great importance to provide against offenses, and
   to fortify the minds of the godly. "Whatever may be the condition of
   your affairs, and though you should be oppressed by afflictions on all
   sides, still continue to cherish this assured hope, that the law will
   go forth out of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem; for this
   is an infallible decree of God, which no diversity or change of events
   will make void."

   How much the godly needed this consolation may be easily inferred from
   the course of events which immediately followed; for when Judea had
   been forsaken, the temple destroyed, the worship of Goal overturned,
   and the comely order of the Church utterly defaced while tyranny became
   more and more oppressive, it was natural that their minds should be
   discouraged, and that all hope should be thrown away. On the other
   hand, after the return of the Jews from Babylon, when dreadful
   superstitions gradually obtained prevalence, and the priests, instead
   of discharging their office in a lawful manner, grasped at wicked
   tyranny, what else could have occurred to the minds of the goodly than
   that religion had fallen into neglect, and that the worship of Goal was
   entirely laid aside, if they had not been supported by this promise?
   For there can be no doubt that this temptation, which arose out of
   internal vices, was more injurious than their banishment into Babylon.
   So long as they were exiles, they had at least prophets, by whose
   instruction they were encouraged; but in that state of corruption the
   good effect of instruction had been lost, and no regard was paid to
   religion or godliness. But by the aid of this prediction alone the Lord
   granted to them the support which they needed. For why had the law,
   which God appeared to have consecrated for himself in his own
   habitation, been thrown down and basely trampled under foot? Who, then,
   would have thought not only that it would have a place there, but that
   it would also reign in all foreign places, and in the most distant
   regions? On the other hand, the Prophet declares not only that the law
   will remain in its place, but that it will travel further; by which he
   means that it will not be confined within its former boundaries, for it
   will be proclaimed to the Gentiles without distinction.

   And undoubtedly this had very great authority and weight with the
   Apostles, when they knew that they were appointed to perform those
   things which are here promised. Otherwise they would never have had
   courage enough to venture to undertake the office, and, in short, would
   not have been able to endure the burden, especially when the whole
   world furiously opposed them. But they knew that he by whom this had
   been promised, and from whom they had received authority to deliver
   this message, would easily remove every obstacle. It ought also to be
   observed that we obtain from it a strong confirmation of our faith,
   when we learn that the doctrine of the gospel came forth out of Zion;
   because we thence conclude that it is not new, or lately sprung up, but
   that it is the eternal truth of God, of which a testimony had been
   given in all ages before it was brought to light.

   We also infer that it was necessary that all the ancient ceremonies
   should be abolished, and that a new form of teaching should be
   introduced, though the substance of the doctrine continue to be the
   same; for the law formerly proceeded out of Mount Sinai, (Exodus
   19:20,) but now it proceeded out of Zion, and therefore it assumed a
   new form. Two things, therefore, must be observed; first, that the
   doctrine of God is the same, and always agrees with itself; that no one
   may charge God with changeableness, as if he were inconsistent; and
   though the law of the Lord be now the same that it ever was, yet it
   came out of Zion with a new garment; secondly, when ceremonies and
   shadows had been abolished, Christ was revealed, in whom the reality of
   them is perceived.

   4. And he shall judge among the nations He means that the doctrine will
   be like a king's scepter, that God may rule among all nations; for, by
   a figure of speech in which a part is taken for the whole, the Hebrew
   word spht, (shaphat,) to judge, means to govern or to reign. since,
   therefore, God had not taken more than one nation to be subject to his
   reign, the Prophet here shows that the boundaries of his kingdom will
   be enlarged, that he may rule over various nations. He likewise notices
   indirectly the difference between the kingdom of David, which was but a
   shadow, and this other kingdom, which would be far more excellent. At
   that time God ruled over his chosen people by the hand of David, but
   after the coming of Christ he began to reign by himself, that is, in
   the person of his only-begotten Son, who was truly God manifested in
   the flesh. (1 Timothy 3:16.) The prophets sometimes employ the name of
   David when they are speaking about the kingdom of Christ, and they do
   so with propriety, that is, with respect to his human nature; for the
   Redeemer had been promised to spring from that family. (Jeremiah 30:9;
   Ezekiel 34:23; 37:24.) But here the Prophet extols his divine majesty
   from which it is evident how much more excellent is the condition of
   the new Church than that of the ancient Church, since God hath revealed
   himself as King in his Son. And again he confirms the calling of the
   Gentiles, because Christ is not sent to the Jews only, that he may
   reign over them, but that he may hold his sway over the whole world.

   And shall rebuke many nations The word ykch (yakach) sometimes means to
   expostulate, sometimes to correct, and likewise to prepare; but the
   ordinary interpretation is most suitable to this passage, in which the
   Prophet speaks of the reformation of the Church. For we need
   correction, that we may learn to submit ourselves to God; because, in
   consequence of the obstinacy which belongs to our nature, we shall
   never make progress in the word of God, till we have been subdued by
   violence. Accordingly, Christ makes the beginning of preaching the
   gospel to be, that the world be reproved concerning sin. (John 16:8.)
   That the doctrine may not be without profit, Isaiah shows that the
   stubbornness of our flesh must be subdued; and therefore he attributes
   to God the office of a reproving judge, that he may try our life, and,
   by condemning our vices, may effect a reformation of our morals. And,
   indeed, we see how little effect is produced by the gospel unless where
   that power of the Spirit is exercised which leads men to repentance.

   And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares He next mentions the
   beneficial result which will follow, when Christ shall have brought the
   Gentiles and the nations under his dominion. Nothing is more desirable
   than peace; but while all imagine that they desire it, every one
   disturbs it by the madness of his lusts; for pride, and covetousness,
   and ambition, lead men to rise up in cruelty against each other. Since,
   therefore, men are naturally led away by their evil passions to disturb
   society, Isaiah here promises the correction of this evil; for, as the
   gospel is the doctrine of reconciliation, (2 Corinthians 5:18,) which
   removes the enmity between us and God, so it brings men into peace and
   harmony with each other. The meaning amounts to this, that Christ's
   people will be meek, and, laying aside fierceness, will be devoted to
   the pursuit of peace.

   This has been improperly limited by some commentators to the time when
   Christ was born; because at that time, after the battle of Actium, the
   temple of Janus [37] was closed, as appears from the histories. I
   readily admit that the universal peace which existed throughout the
   Roman empire, at the birth of Christ, was a token of that eternal peace
   which we enjoy in Christ. But the Prophet's meaning was different. He
   meant that Christ makes such a reconciliation between God and men, that
   a comfortable state of peace exists among themselves, by putting an end
   to destructive wars. For if Christ be taken away, not only are we
   estranged from God, but we incessantly carry on open war with him,
   which is justly thrown back on our own heads; and the consequence is,
   that everything in the world is in disorder.

   Besides, Isaiah promises that, when the gospel shall be published, it
   will be an excellent remedy for putting an end to quarrels; and not
   only so, but that, when resentments have been laid aside, men will be
   disposed to assist each other. For he does not merely say, swords shall
   be broken in pieces, but they shall be turned into mattocks; by which
   he shows that there will be so great a change that, instead of annoying
   one another, and committing various acts of injustice, as they had
   formerly done, they will henceforth cultivate peace and friendship, and
   will employ their exertions for the common advantage of all; for
   mattocks and pruning-hooks are instruments adapted to agriculture, and
   are profitable and necessary for the life of man. He therefore shows
   that, when Christ shall reign, those who formerly were hurried along by
   the love of doing mischief, will afterwards contend with each other, in
   every possible way, by acts of kindness.

   Neither shall they practice war any more [38] The word lmd (lamad)
   signifies either to be accustomed to, or to learn. But the meaning of
   the Prophet is plain enough, that they will not train themselves in
   destructive arts, and will not strive with each other in acts of
   cruelty and injustice, as they were formerly accustomed to do. Hence we
   infer that they have made little proficiency in the gospel, whose
   hearts have not been formed to meekness, and among whom there does not
   yet reign that brotherly love which leads men to perform kind offices
   to each other. But this cannot be done before the consciences have been
   brought into a state of peace with God; for we must begin there, in
   order that we may also be at peace with men.

   Some madmen torture this passage to promote anarchy, (anarchian) as if
   it took away from the Church entirely the right to use the sword, and
   bring it forward for condemning with great severity every kind of wars.
   For example, if a prince defend the people entrusted to him, and
   protect them against injustice, those people say, "It is unlawful for
   Christians to use the sword." But it is easy to reply to this; for the
   Prophet speaks metaphorically about the kingdom of Christ, which leads
   men, through mutual kindness, to become reconciled to each other. The
   Scriptures frequently employ a metaphor, in which the thing signified
   is denoted by a sign; as in that passage,

   He who hath not a sword, let him buy one. (Luke 22:36.)

   Christ certainly did not intend to induce his followers to fight, but
   intimated that the time of war was at hand. 0n the other hand, we are
   told that swords shall cease to exist, or shall be beaten down to serve
   a different purpose, when hatred and fighting shall be at an end, and
   when they who formerly were at enmity shall be reconciled to each
   other.

   It may be objected that, in a state of harmony and peace, the sword
   will no longer be needed. I reply, that peace exists among us just as
   far as the kingly power of Christ is acknowledged, and that these two
   things have a mutual relation. Would that Christ reigned entirely in
   us! for then would peace also have its perfect influence. But since we
   are still widely distant from the perfection of that peaceful reign, we
   must always think of making progress; and it is excessive folly not to
   consider that the kingdom of Christ here is only beginning. Besides,
   God did not gather a Church -- by which is meant an assembly of godly
   men -- so as to be separate from others; but the good are always mixed
   with the bad; and not only so, but the good have not yet reached the
   goal, and are widely distant from that perfection which is required
   from them. The fulfillment of this prophecy, therefore, in its full
   extent, must not be looked for on earth. It is enough, if we experience
   the beginning, and if, being reconciled to God through Christ, we
   cultivate mutual friendship, and abstain from doing harm to any one.

   5. O house of Jacob He sharply rebukes the Jews by holding out the
   example of the Gentiles; for since, in consequence of the spread of his
   kingdom, God would give law to all nations from Mount Zion, so as to
   ingraft them into the body of his chosen people, nothing could be more
   strange than that the house of Jacob should revolt from him, and that,
   when strangers were drawing near, the members of the household, who
   ought to have been foremost, should withdraw. This is, therefore, not
   only an exceedingly vehement exhortation, but also a heavy and sharp
   complaint. Accordingly, he addresses them by an honorable name, saying,
   O house of Jacob, come; that he may express more strongly their
   ingratitude, which appeared in twist that though they were in the
   Church God's first-born, they utterly renounced that right of
   inheritance which they held in common with others.

   There is, therefore, an implied comparison, as if he had said, "Lo, the
   Gentiles flow together to Mount Zion, and every one exhorts and urges
   on his neighbor; they submit to receive instruction from God, and to be
   reproved by him and why do you, O Israelites, you who are the
   inheritance of God, why do you draw back? Shall the Gentiles submit to
   God, and shall you refuse to acknowledge his authority? Has so great a
   light been kindled in every part of the world, and shall you not be
   enlightened by it? Shall so many waters flow, and will you not drink?
   What madness is this, that when the Gentiles run so eagerly, you sit
   still in idleness?"

   And we will walk in the light of the Lord When he adds we will walk, he
   means that the light is placed before their feet, but that they
   disregard it by shutting their eyes, and even extinguish it as far as
   lies in their power; and yet its brightness draws to it distant
   nations.

   6. Surely thou hast forsaken thy people In these words he now plainly
   charges the people with having a perverse disposition; and he does this
   not in direct terms, but, as it were, bursting into astonishment, he
   suddenly breaks off his discourse, and, turning to God, exclaims, "Why
   should I waste words on a nation grown desperate, which thou, O Lord,
   hast justly rejected, because, giving itself up to idolatrous
   practices, it has treacherously departed from thy word?"

   It may also be a prediction of punishment still future which he foresaw
   by the Spirit; as if he had said, That it was not wonderful if ruin and
   desolation were about to overtake Mount Zion on account of the great
   crimes of the nation. His design may have been, that so mournful a
   spectacle might not be the occasion of despair, and that those who were
   capable of being cured might be moved by repentance, and turn to God
   ere this calamity arrived. For while the prophets are heralds of God's
   judgments, and threaten vengeance against the ungodly, they usually
   endeavor, at the same time, to bring as many as they can to some kind
   of repentance. The servants of God ought never to lay aside this
   disposition, which would lead them to endeavor to do good even to the
   reprobate, if that were possible. (2 Timothy 2:25.)

   This passage ought to yield abundant consolation to godly teachers; for
   when we think that we are speaking to the deaf, we become faint, and
   are tempted to give up all exertion, and to say, "What am I about? I am
   beating the air." Yet the Prophet does not cease to exhort those in
   whom he perceived no ground of comfortable hope; and while he stands
   like one astonished at this destruction of the people, he nevertheless
   addresses those whom he sees going to ruin. At the same time we must
   observe that, however obstinate the ungodly may be, we must pronounce
   vengeance against them; and though they refuse and gnaw the bridle,
   yet, that they may be left without excuse, we must always summon them
   to the judgment-seat of God.

   I consider the ky (ki) to mean surely; [39] for this signification is
   more suitable, because he breaks off the exhortation which he had
   begun, and addresses God. And when he again calls them the house of
   Jacob, this is added for the purpose of imparting greater vehemence, as
   is usually done in a moving discourse; as if he had said, "This holy
   nation, which God had chosen, is now forsaken."

   Because they are replenished from the East As the Hebrew word qdm
   (kadem) sometimes denotes the east, and sometimes antiquity, it may be
   interpreted to mean that they were filled with ancient manners; because
   they had again brought into use those superstitions by which the land
   of Canaan was formerly infected. For we know that the prophets often
   reproach the nation of Israel with resembling the Canaanites more than
   they resembled Abraham and the rest of the holy fathers. And, indeed,
   because they had been brought into the possession of this land, when
   the ancient inhabitants had been driven out, in order that it might be
   cleansed from its pollution, and afterwards devoted to holiness, the
   refusal to change their wicked customs involved a twofold ingratitude.
   But as the other meaning -- from the East -- has been more generally
   adopted, I have chosen to retain it; though even in this view the
   commentators differ, for some consider the letter m (mem) to denote
   comparison, and mqdm (mikkedem) to denote more than the inhabitants of
   thee East, while others adopt the simpler, and, as I think, the more
   correct view, that they were filled with the east, that is, with the
   vices which they had contracted from that quarter; for wicked imitation
   is amazingly contagious, and nothing is more natural than that
   corruptions should glide from one place into another more distant.

   And with divinations, like the Philistines This clause explains the
   former more fully; for under divinations he includes, by synecdoche,
   the impostures of Satan to which heathen nations were addicted. The
   Prophet therefore means that they now differ in no respect from the
   Philistines, though God had separated them from that people by the
   privilege of his adoption; and this was sufficient to bring upon them
   the severest condemnation, that they had forgotten their calling, and
   polluted themselves with the corrupted and ungodly customs of the
   Gentiles. Hence it appears that to sin by the example of another
   contributes nothing to alleviate the guilt.

   And have delighted in the children of strangers The last part of the
   verse is interpreted in various ways; because the phrase, the children
   of strangers, is viewed by some metaphorically, as denoting laws and
   customs; while others regard them as referring to marriages; because,
   by marrying indiscriminately women of foreign extraction, they had
   mingled their seed, so that there were many illegitimate children.
   Jerome gives a harsher exposition, that they polluted themselves by
   wicked lusts contrary to nature. For my own part, I have no doubt that
   by the children of strangers are meant foreign nations, and not
   figuratively the laws themselves. The crime charged against them by the
   Prophet therefore is, that, by endeavoring to please the Gentiles, they
   entangled themselves in their vices, and thus preferred not only mortal
   men, but wicked men, to God. He says that they delighted, because the
   desire or delight of wicked imitation effaced from their hearts the
   love of God and of sound doctrine.

   7. Their land is filled with silver and gold We must attend to the
   order which the Prophet here observes; for he now enumerates the
   reasons why the Lord rejected his people. In the former verse he began
   with divinations and the customs of strangers; he now comes down to
   silver and gold; and afterwards he will speak of horses and chariots.
   There can be no doubt that, having first condemned idolatry, he
   reproves them, secondly, for covetousness, and, thirdly, for sinful
   trust, when men depart from God, and contrive for themselves vain
   grounds of confidence. It was not a thing in itself to be condemned,
   that this nation had abundance of gold and silver; but because they
   burned with insatiable covetousness, and trusted to horses and
   chariots, he justly reproves them.

   The Hebrew particle v (vau) is here viewed by some as denoting a
   contrast, supposing the meaning to be, and yet their land is filled
   with silver and gold. This would show the ingratitude of the people to
   be the greater, because, though they enjoyed an abundance of all good
   things, they betook themselves, as if their case had been desperate, to
   magical arts and to idols, which is much less excusable than if they
   had fled to them during their adversity; because, though they were fed
   to the full with an abundance of good things, yet they shook off the
   yoke of God. In this way he would aggravate the criminality of a nation
   that fled to idols freely and of their own accord, even though they
   were luxuriating in their abundance. But I do not receive this
   interpretation, for I think it too far-fetched. On the contrary, he
   includes in one continued enumeration the vices with which that nation
   was chargeable, covetousness, sinful confidence, and idolatry.
   Accordingly, though the opinion of those who explain it as a contrast
   be a true opinion, it does not harmonize with this passage.

   And there is no end of their treasures Isaiah proceeds to illustrate
   more clearly and forcibly what he has formerly said; for, though it be
   not in itself sinful or blamable that a person should possess gold or
   silver, provided that he make a proper use of it, he properly launches
   out against that wicked desire and mad eagerness to accumulate money,
   which is most detestable. He says that there is no end, because their
   eagerness is insatiable, and goes beyond the bounds of nature. The same
   opinion must be formed about horses and chariots, for false confidence
   is here reproved. To prevent this evil, the Lord had forbidden kings to
   gather together a great multitude of horses or chariots, lest, trusting
   to them, they should cause the people to return to Egypt. (Deuteronomy
   17:16.) since, therefore, it is difficult for men to have resources of
   this kind in abundance without being also lifted up with pride, it was
   the will of God that his people should not have them at all, or at
   least should be satisfied with a moderate share.

   8. Their land is also full of idols He repeats what he had already
   noticed about idolatry, but enters into it more fully; and, having
   first mentioned the subject itself, he next speaks of the use of it,
   which almost always follows. It seldom happens that we do not abuse
   idols when they are set up among us, for it is as when fire has been
   applied to a pile of wood, which must immediately burn; and wood is not
   more ready to be set on fire than we are to follow superstition. In the
   Hebrew language idols are very properly denominated by the word 'lylym,
   (elilim) which the Prophet here employs, for they are empty things, and
   of no value. [40] And undoubtedly the Holy Spirit intended by this word
   to reprove the madness of men who imagined that, by relying on such
   inventions, they approached nearer to God; as the papists of the
   present day, in order to plead for the usefulness of their idols, boast
   that they are the books of the unlearned: but we ought rather to
   believe the testimony of the Holy Spirit; and even the facts themselves
   plainly show what advantage the unlearned derive from them; for, led
   away by gross fancies, they imagine to themselves earthly and carnal
   gods. Hence Jeremiah justly declares not only that idols are useless,
   but that they are teachers of falsehood and lies. (Jeremiah 10:14.)

   And they have bowed down [41] before the work of their own hands We
   must also attend to this description, in which the Prophet relates that
   the people bowed down before the works of their own hands; for how
   stupid was it that men should not only worship wood and stone instead
   of God, but should honor their own workmanship with the appellation of
   Deity, which they cannot bestow on themselves! It is truly shocking and
   monstrous that, as soon as a block of wood which lay neglected has
   received the finishing-stroke from a mortal man, he presently worships
   it as if it had been made a God. Although the Prophet addresses the
   ancient people, the same reasoning applies to the papists, who
   acknowledge no majesty of God but in the works of their own hands.

   Before that which their own fingers have made The repetition is
   emphatic, and to the hands he adds the fingers, in order to exhibit
   more strongly the grossness of the crime. We must also attend to the
   mode of expression, which denotes adoration by means of outward
   gesture; not that it is unlawful among men to bend the knee or the head
   for the sake of paying public respect, but because he who bows down
   before an idol professes to render divine worship. Consequently, the
   silly talk of papists about that adoration which they call Dulia [42]
   (douleia) is a childish evasion; for when the Prophet speaks of
   religious worship he condemns universally every token of homage. [43]

   9. And the mean man boweth down Some commentators read these words in
   immediate connection with what goes before, as if the Prophet were
   proceeding still farther to show the extent of their criminality. If we
   adopt this meaning, then by the mean man and the mighty man we must
   understand all the Israelites; as if the Prophet said that no man is
   pure and free from this stain. Others not improperly are of opinion
   that he repeats in other words what he had said about punishment, and
   that in this way he expresses the destruction which awaits a people
   forsaken by God. This will agree best with the scope of the passage,
   that all, both small and great, will speedily be overtaken by the ruin
   which lays low a whole nation; because amidst so great wickedness there
   was no reason to expect deliverance from the vengeance of God.

   Besides, in those two expressions, bow down and humble, there is a
   rapid allusion to that bowing down which he mentioned a little before,
   as if he had said, "They have bowed themselves down before idols,
   therefore God will lay them low under a vast weight of calamities." Yet
   I have no doubt that he likewise attacks their pride; for it was
   difficult to believe that a nation so abundantly supplied with wealth
   would, in a short period, be overwhelmed by calamities.

   Therefore forgive them not; or, thou wilt not forgive them. This latter
   clause is explained in two ways, though it does not much affect the
   real meaning which of the views you adopt; for the design of the
   Prophet is to show that towards such obstinate men God will not be
   appeased. If it be taken in the future tense, thou wilt not forgive
   them, the meaning will be more easily brought out; but if it be taken
   as a prayer, forgive them not, it will amount to the same thing; for we
   know that, when the prophets, inflamed by zeal for God, pour out
   prayers as under the dictation of the Spirit, they threaten just
   punishment against the ungodly: and we need not wonder that the
   Prophets offended by crimes so numerous and so shocking, kindles into
   such warmth that he consigns his countrymen to destruction; for nothing
   was more dear to him than the sacred honor of God. But at the same time
   it must be understood that he makes a tacit reservation of a remnant;
   because he does not here speak of every individual, but of the body of
   the people, which was so deeply infected by its vices that there was no
   hope of cure; otherwise it would have been unreasonable to give
   exhortations to repentance, and to hold out the hope of pardon to men
   who were incurable and thoroughly obstinate. The meaning therefore
   amounts to this, that the restoration of a new Church must not be
   expected till God has executed his judgments by destroying the temple.

   10. Enter into the rock As ungodly men, for the most part, lull
   themselves in excessive indifference about God's threatenings, it is
   customary with the prophets, when they threaten sinners, with the view
   of producing terror, to add lively descriptions, as if for the purpose
   of bringing those matters under the immediate view of men. This is the
   reason why the Prophet now bids despisers of God enter into the rocks
   and caves, to conceal themselves under ground. And, first, he means
   that the judgment of God is more to be dreaded than a thousand deaths,
   and that for the sake of escaping that judgment it were to be wished
   that they should go down into the grave. But, by addressing men
   themselves, he gives a more impressive illustration of the weight of
   the divine vengeance.

   From the dread of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty Although
   by the dread of God he means the scourges by which God would take
   vengeance on a wicked people, yet it is not without good reason that he
   immediately adds, his magnificent glory; as if he had said, "It is
   according to the measure of his own glory that God ought to be dreaded
   by the ungodly, in whose destruction he displays his boundless power."
   But though the ungodly are not reformed or made to bow down by any
   punishment, they are forced to tremble when they feel the presence of
   the wrath of God. In quite a different manner do punishments instruct
   the elect to fear God; for, in consequence of being subdued by strokes,
   they learn to bear the yoke. Isaiah therefore declares that the glory
   of God will be more illustriously displayed when he shall come forth as
   a righteous judge; for when he conceals himself he is not observed, and
   they scarcely think of his existence.

   Hence let pastors learn how they ought to deal with drowsy consciences,
   which must be awakened by the judgment of God, that they may regard
   that judgment with actual dread. Though we often sing to the deaf, yet
   terror pierces even hearts of iron, so that they are without excuse.
   Frequently, too, it happens that some are healed; and in like manner
   believers gain advantage from it, when they learn the terrific forms of
   punishment which await the ungodly and reprobate.

   11 The loftiness of the looks of man [44] shall be humbled Wicked men,
   relying on the wealth and quietness and prosperity which they at
   present enjoy, regard the threatenings of the Prophets with haughty
   disdain, and thus harden their hearts against God, and are even led to
   indulge in wantonness. 0n this account, Isaiah here determines, as we
   have already said, to repress their arrogance; as if he had said, "The
   time will come when this pride of yours, by which you vainly and madly
   contend against God, shall be brought down." For wicked men, though
   they pretend to have some religion, are yet so daring that they raze
   against God himself, and imagine that they are higher than God. On the
   other hand, by thundering against them, he lays low their haughtiness,
   that he alone may be exalted.

   And this is what we have already said, that when crimes are allowed to
   pass unpunished, it is a sort of cloud held before our eyes, which
   hinders us from beholding the glory of the Lord; but when he takes
   vengeance on men's transgressions, his glory shines forth
   illustriously. This is also the reason which Solomon assigns why wicked
   men are hardened against God: it is because they think that bad and
   good men are equally happy in this world.

   Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
   therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil,
   (Ecclesiastes 8:11;)

   for all of them grow more insolent, and are more and more blinded.

   But here he shows that, when proud men shall have been brought to their
   proper level, there will be nothing to prevent God from being
   acknowledged to be what he is. It was indeed highly becoming that the
   people should, of their own accord, humbly behold the greatness of God,
   under whose shadow they were defended; and for this purpose the
   posterity of Abraham was so remarkably distinguished by numerous
   blessings, that it might be the mirror of the glory and holiness of
   God. Isaiah now threatens that, because the Jews have risen up against
   him, God will employ a new method of exalting his glory, that is, by
   their destruction. When he speaks of lofty looks and loftiness, he
   employs an outward gesture to denote the inward pride of the mind; for
   sinful confidence almost always betrays, by the very looks, a contempt
   of God and of men. In the same sense does David describe the man whose
   eyes are lofty. (Psalm 101:5.)

   12. For the day of the LORD of hosts will be on every one that is proud
   and lofty In this verse he confirms the same thing more fully and from
   the vehement manner in which he heaps up words, we may easily infer how
   bold was the wickedness which at that time abounded. But we shall not
   wonder that he labors so hard to subdue the arrogance of men, if we
   consider how difficult it is to bend the stubbornness of those who,
   relying on their wealth, are afraid of nothing, and who suppose that
   the design of their elevated rank is, that whatever they do shall pass
   unpunished. For even at the present day we experience how sensitive and
   passionate those men are who make arrogant claims for themselves, and
   how obstinately they reject all admonitions. And this is also the
   reason why the Prophet uses sharp language against theme instead of
   threatening vengeance, in general terms, against the whole nation.

   Yet it is not against the princes alone, whose high rank raised them
   far above other men, that his invectives are launched; for not only
   they, but even persons of the lowest rank, often swell with pride; and,
   as the common proverb runs, "Every man carries within him the heart of
   a king." In like manner, we find that even the basest persons, if you
   do but prick them with a pill, vomit out the poison of intolerable
   arrogance. Since, therefore, this vice was so widely spread, Isaiah
   includes both the highest and the lowest of the people, declaring that
   in proportion to the forbearance which God had exercised toward them is
   the severity of the impending judgment; for, in consequence of their
   abundance, their hearts had swollen to fierceness.

   Moreover, though the letter l, (lamed,) [45] which is the sign of the
   dative case, be sometimes superfluous, yet in this passage it retains
   its force; for it would appear that Isaiah appoints a fixed day, as
   usually happens in judicial trials. Accordingly, I interpret it to mean
   that God himself hath previously appointed a day on which proud men
   must be summoned to the judgment-seat of God, to receive a sentence of
   condemnation.

   We may also learn from these words that God avows himself to be the
   enemy of all the proud. This appointing of a day is therefore to the
   same effect as if God declared that he cannot endure men wickedly to
   indulge in pride, and that they who unduly exalt themselves cannot
   escape being crushed by his hand. And if our minds were sincerely
   convinced of this, who would not abhor pride, which provokes the anger
   of God against us? If any person choose rather to interpret (superbum
   et elatum) proud and lofty as in the neuter gender, meaning that which
   is proud and lofty, we must understand them to refer to the fortresses,
   bulwarks, and fortifications; but the rules of grammar do not admit of
   their being applied in any other way than to persons.

   13. Upon all the cedars of Lebanon The allegory which is here
   introduced, about the trees of Lebanon and the lofty mountains, instead
   of obscuring, sheds light on the subject; for however high may be the
   wishes or endeavors of a mortal man, yet he will never be able to reach
   the height of the mountains and the lofty trees, which it is as easy
   for God to throw down as for a breath of wind to scatter the fallen
   leaves. Accordingly, in what may be called a painting, Isaiah shows to
   proud men how idle and foolish they are in believing that their
   elevation will be their defense. There is also an implied exaggeration,
   which must have contributed to heighten the terror. It cannot be
   supposed that God is actually angry with the mountains and trees, or
   that, having changed his purpose, he throws down what he has built up;
   but in the harmless creatures Isaiah holds out to view the judgment of
   God, in order more fully to convince wicked and unprincipled men that
   their presumption will not pass unpunished. Thus we see the reason why
   he mixes up the metaphors of cedars, oaks, and mountains

   15. And upon every lofty tower What he adds about towers and walls is
   not figurative or metaphorical. We know how men, when they think that
   they are well defended, congratulate themselves that they no longer
   need the assistance of God. Accordingly, under the name of towers and
   walls Isaiah mentions the object of false confidence; for if any place
   seem to be impregnable, there do irreligious men build their nest, that
   they may look down from it on heaven and earth; for they imagine that
   they are placed beyond all the uncertainties of fortune. Isaiah
   therefore threatens that, when it shall please God to humble men, he
   will throw down all the defenses on which they place a false
   confidence. And although those things are not in themselves evil, yet
   because they receive too large a share of our attention, it is with
   great propriety that Isaiah sharpens his pen against them.

   To the same purpose is what he says about horses and chariots; for, as
   we are told by Micah, because men have improperly relied on earthly
   riches, they must be altogether deprived of them, that they may owe
   this preservation entirely to the hand of God. (Micah 5:10.) A little
   before, he had reproved them for the abundance of their horses (verse
   7); he now addresses them about the judgment of God, and warns them
   that, as the only possible way of gaining the favor of God, he must
   take from the Jews all their horsemen, that they may no longer place
   sinful reliance on earthly support.

   16. And upon all ships of Tarshish Tarshish was unquestionably the
   Hebrew name for Cilicia; and as the Jews had much traffic with that
   nation, Scripture frequently mentions the ships of Tarshish, which are
   so called, because they sailed on that sea. Navigation cannot, indeed,
   be condemned on its own account; for, by importing and exporting
   articles of merchandise, it is of great advantage to mankind. Nor can
   any fault be found with this mode of intercourse between nations; for
   it is the will of God that the whole human race should be joined
   together by, mutual acts of kindness. But as it most frequently happens
   that abundance leads to pride and cruelty, Isaiah reproves this kind of
   merchandise, which was the chief source of the wealth of the land.
   Besides, in that merchandise which is carried on with distant and
   foreign nations, there is often a large amount of tricks and
   dishonesty, and no limit set to the desire of gain. First, then, Isaiah
   means that the Jews will be deprived of riches, that they may learn to
   submit to God. Secondly, he describes covetousness and unlawful gains
   by means of a sign, as if one were to express murder by holding out a
   bloody sword.

   And upon elegant pictures This second part of the verse shows still
   more clearly that the Prophet condemns navigation, which had brought
   many corruptions into the land. It is too frequent and common that
   riches are followed by luxury, effeminacy, and a superfluity of
   pleasures, which we commonly see in wealthy countries and commercial
   cities; for those who trade by sea in distant countries are not
   satisfied with the commodities obtained at home, but carry away new
   luxuries which were formerly unknown. Since, therefore, wealth is
   usually the mother of superfluity, the Prophet here mentions costly
   furniture, as if he had said that the Jews, by adorning their houses at
   great expense, draw down upon themselves the judgment of God; for he
   employs the word pictures, by a well-known figure of speech, to denote
   rich tapestry, and the productions of Phrygia, and vessels framed with
   consummate skill

   It is certain that the manners of men are corrupted, when they eagerly
   pursue, in every direction, superfluous enjoyments And we see how
   destruction was brought on the Roman Empire by delicacies of this
   nature; for before they traveled into Greece, the greatest moderation
   prevailed among them; and no sooner had Asia been vanquished than they
   began to grow soft and effeminate; and when their eyes were dazzled by
   pictures, furniture, precious stones, and tapestry and their nostrils
   regaled by ointments and perfumes, all their senses were immediately
   overpowered, and, by imitating the luxury of the East as a higher form
   of civilization, they began gradually to indulge in every kind of
   debauchery.

   17. And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down The Prophet declares
   that he had his eye on men, when he described the various kinds of
   loftiness; for God is not displeased saith the steep mountains or tall
   cedars, which he created, but informs us that the whole evil lies in
   men, who vainly trust to what is high and lofty. It may be objected,
   that it frequently happens that wicked men are not rendered more humble
   by chastisement, but, on the contrary, become more fierce and
   obstinate, as is evident from the case of Pharaohs whose hardness of
   heart no plagues could subdue, (Exodus 8:15, and 9:34;) and
   consequently that what the Prophet here threatens does not always take
   place. I reply, he does not describe the effect of chastisement, as if
   God bent rebellious men to obey hills; but the meaning of this passage
   is, that, although the hearts of the reprobate be not changed, yet the
   Lord will not cease to inflict punishment upon them, till their
   haughtiness and presumption are brought low. For, trusting to their
   wealth and fortifications, they congratulate themselves, as we have
   said, on their safety, and do not fear God. But whatever may be the
   nature of their defenses, the Lord will easily subdue and lay them low,
   and that not only by one or another chastisement, but by chastisements
   so numerous and so severe, that they will at length be beaten down and
   subdued, will cease to rise up against him, and will acknowledge that
   they gain nothing by their insolence and presumption. The next clause,
   and the LORD alone shall be exalted, has been already explained.

   18 And the idols he will utterly abolish As he had formerly, in his
   reproof, joined idolatry with luxury and covetousness, and other views;
   so he now joins them in the threatening of punishment.

   19. And they shall enter into the holes of the rocks He had formerly
   used other words when addressing them in the second person, Enter into
   the rock, (verse 10,) that he might inflict a severer stroke on their
   minds. But now he declares what they will do, and says that they must
   enter; and hence it is evident that the former statement was not an
   exhortation, but a severe denunciation of the wrath of God, in order to
   terrify wicked and obstinate men, who despise all warnings and all
   threatenings.

   From the presence of the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his
   majesty What he adds about the terror of God must be understood to mean
   that terror which was thrown into them by the Chaldeans and Assyrians,
   whose hand he called a little before, and now also calls, the glory of
   God for God employed their agency to chastise his people. Although they
   were wicked and treacherous, yet they promoted the glory of God; for
   even the devil himself contributes in some way to the glory of God,
   though contrary to his wish. Thus he speaks of the Assyrians and
   Chaldeans, because in the punishments which the Lord will inflict on
   the Jews by their agency we may behold his glory

   The same thing is confirmed by the word Arise, which means to go before
   the judgment-seat. In the phrase which immediately follows, lrts h'rph,
   (laarotz haaretz,) to shake terribly the earth, there is an elegant
   allusion or play on words, which can hardly be conveyed in any other
   language. [46] He says that the Lord ariseth, because he appears to
   sleep so long as he delays his judgments. But he ariseth, when he comes
   forth as a judge to inflict punishments on the wicked; so as to make it
   evident to men that nothing escapes the knowledge, or is hidden from
   the eyes, of Him who permits no crime to pass unpunished.

   20. In that day a man will cast away his idols Idolaters are amazingly
   delighted with their own superstitions and ungodly worship; for
   although they abound in enormities and crimes, still they betake
   themselves to this refuge, that they imagine that their worship
   appeases God. Just as in the present day, if we should represent the
   crimes and lawless passions of every kind which abound among the
   papists, they certainly will not be able to deny our statements, but
   will flatter themselves on this ground, that they have a plausible form
   of worship, and will believe that this vail covers all their crimes.
   Accordingly, the Prophet deprives idolaters of this cloak, and
   threatens that they will no longer be able to conceal their pollution;
   for the Lord will compel them to throw away their idols, that they may
   acknowledge that they had no good reason for placing their hope and
   confidence in them.

   In short, they will be ashamed of their foolishness; for in prosperity
   they think that they enjoy the favor of God, as if he showed that he
   takes delight in their worship; and they cannot be convinced to the
   contrary, until God actually make evident how greatly he abhors them.
   It is only when they are brought into adversity that they begin to
   acknowledge their wickedness, as Hosea strikingly illustrates by
   comparing them to whores, who do not acknowledge their wickedness so
   long as they make gain, and live in splendor, but who, when they are
   deprived of those enjoyments, and forsaken by their lovers, begin to
   think of their wretchedness and disgrace, and enter into the way of
   repentance, of which they had never thought while they enjoyed luxury.
   (Hosea 2:5.) The same thing almost always happens with idolaters, who
   are not ashamed of their wickedness, so as to cast away their idols,
   until they have been visited by very sore distress, and made almost to
   think that they are ruined.

   Which they made; that is, which were made for them by the agency of
   workmen. Nor was this all unnecessary addition; for he means that
   pretended gods are not entitled to adoration: and what sort of gods can
   they be that have been made by men, seeing that God exists from
   himself, and never had a beginning? It is therefore highly foolish, and
   contrary to reason, that men should worship the work of their own
   hands. So then by this expression, he aggravates their criminality,
   that idols, though they are composed of gold or silver, or some other
   perishable material, and have been manufactured by men, are yet
   worshipped instead of God; and at the same time he states the reason
   why they are displeasing to God: it is, because they are worshipped. On
   what pretense will the papists now excuse their ungodliness? for they
   cannot deny that they render adoration to images; and wherever such
   worship is performed, there ungodliness is clearly proved.

   Into the holes of the moles and of the bats By the holes of the moles
   he means any filthy places in which they are disgracefully concealed.

   21. And they shall enter into the clefts of the rocks This repetition
   is not superfluous, though Isaiah again employs the same words which he
   had lately used; for what is so difficult as to impress on the minds of
   men sincere fear of God? Nor is it only in hypocrites that we perceive
   this, but in ourselves, if we bestow careful attention; for how many
   things are presented to us by which our minds ought to be deeply
   affected, and yet we are scarcely moved! More especially, it was
   necessary that this judgment of God should be earnestly placed before
   hypocrites, who took delight in wickedness. But now he points out the
   severity of God's vengeance by this consideration, that the ungodly
   choose rather to be swallowed up by the deepest gulfs than to come
   under the eye of God. This, too, is the passage from which Christ
   borrowed the threatening which he pronounces on the Jews,

   In that day shall they say to the mountains cover us; and to the hills,
   Hide us. (Luke 23:30.)

   22 Cease therefore from man These words are clearly connected with what
   goes before, and have been improperly separated from them by some
   interpreters. For Isaiah, after having addressed the ungodly in
   threatenings concerning the judgment of God, exhorts them to refrain
   from deluding themselves by groundless confidence; as if he had said,
   "I see that you are blinded and intoxicated by false hope, so that no
   argument can prevail with you; and this you do, because you claim too
   much for yourselves. But man is nothing; and you have to do with God,
   who can reduce the whole world to nothing by a single act of his will."

   Whose breath is in his nostrils The former part of the verse is
   explained in various ways; for some interpret it as referring to
   Christ, and view the word rvch, (ruach,) which we render breath, as
   denoting violence, by a comparison which is frequently used in other
   parts of Scripture; [47] and the nostril as denoting anger, because the
   outward sign of anger is in the nostrils. They bring out the meaning in
   this manner: "Beware of provoking the anger of Christ." [48] But if we
   examine the passage closely, that exposition will be found to be at
   variance with the meaning of the words.

   Others understand it as relating to men in general, but explain it by
   that saving, Fear not them who kill the body. (Matthew 10:28.) But
   neither can this interpretation be admitted, which does not agree
   either with the time or the occasion, since there was no reason for
   dissuading them from the fear of men. But, as I have already said, the
   context will quickly remove all doubt; for the commencement of the
   following chapter clearly explains and confirms what is here stated;
   and he who made this division has improperly separated those things
   which ought to have been joined together. For the Prophet is about to
   add, "The Lord will take from you those things which so highly elevate
   your minds, and put you in such high spirits. Your confidence is
   foolish and groundless. "Such is the connection of what he now says,
   "Cease therefore from man, whose breath is in his nostrils."

   But first we must see what is meant by breath in the nostril. It
   denotes human weakness, or, that the life of man is like a breath,
   which immediately vanishes away. And as David says,

   "If the Lord take away the breath, man returns to the dust."
   (Psalm 104:29.)

   Again:

   "His breath will go out, and he will return to his earth."
   (Psalm 146:4.)

   And again:

   "They are flesh, a breath that passeth away and cometh not again."
   (Psalm 78:39.)

   Since, therefore, nothing is more weak or frail than our life, what
   means that confidence, as if our strength were deeply rooted? We ought
   therefore to cease from man; that is, we ought to lay aside groundless
   confidence; because man has his breath in his nostril, for when his
   breath goes out, he is immediately dissolved like water. We speak here
   of the breath of life, for nothing is more frail.

   Besides, when we are forbidden to place confidence in men, let us begin
   with ourselves; that is, let us not in any respect trust to our own
   wisdom or industry. Secondly, let us not depend on the aid of man, or
   on any creature; but let us place our whole confidence in the Lord.
   Cursed. says Jeremiah, is he who trusteth in man, and who placeth his
   strength and his aid in flesh, that is, in outward resources. (Jeremiah
   17:5.)

   For wherein is he to be accounted of? This is the true method of
   repressing haughtiness. Nothing is left to men on which they ought to
   congratulate themselves; for the meaning is as if the Prophet had said
   that the whole glory of the flesh is of no value. It ought also to be
   observed that this is spoken comparatively, in order to inform us, that
   if there be in us anything excellent, it is not our own, but is held by
   us at the will of another. We know that God has adorned the human race
   with gifts which ought not to be despised. We know, also, that some
   excel others; but as the greater part of men neglect God, and flatter
   themselves beyond measure; and as irreligious men go so far as to think
   that they are more than gods, Isaiah wisely separates men from God,
   which the Holy Spirit also does in many other parts of Scripture: for
   when we look at them in themselves, we perceive more fully the frail,
   and fading, and transitory nature of their condition. Accordingly, as
   soon as men begin to make the smallest claim for themselves, they ought
   to have an opportunity of perceiving their vanity, that they may
   acknowledge themselves to be nothing. This single expression throws
   down the pompous applauses of free-will and merits, by which papists
   extol themselves in opposition to the grace of God. That intoxicated
   self-love, in which irreligious men indulge, is also shaken off.
   Lastly, we are brought back to God, the Author of every blessing, that
   we may not suppose that anything excellent is to be found but in hilly
   for he has not received what is due to hilly until the world has been
   stripped of all wisdom, and strength, and righteousness, and, in a
   word, of all praise.

   [36] And he will teach us his ways. -- Eng. Ver.

   [37] The temple of Janus was built by Numa Pompilius, whose wise and
   peaceful administration contrasts strongly with the bloody and
   ferocious wars by which many of the succeeding emperors endeavored to
   make themselves illustrious. It was expressly intended by its founder
   that this temple should repress the natural fierceness of the people by
   discouraging warlike operations. For this purpose the opening or
   shutting of its doors was made to indicate whether the Roman empire was
   in a condition of war or peace with the surrounding states. When war
   raged on all sides, all its doors stood open by night and by day; and
   the shutting of any one of them declared, that in that direction
   towards which it looked peace had been restored. Livy tells us, that so
   remarkable an event as the entire shutting up of this temple, which
   proclaimed that universal peace existed throughout the empire, had
   occurred but thrice during the long period of seven hundred years; once
   under the reign of Numa, next, during the consulship of Titus Manlius,
   and lastly, after the battle of Actium, in which the Emperor Augustus
   gained a splendid naval victory over Mark Antony and Cleopatra, queen
   of Egypt. (Liv. 1:19.) Historians have fixed the date of the latter
   event with extraordinary precision; and, while their only object was to
   pronounce a lofty panegyric on Augustus as the peculiar favourite of
   heaven, they have unintentionally recorded that the temple of Janus was
   shut up when the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6) was ushered into the
   world. So striking a coincidence could not fail to attract observation,
   as belonging to the fullness of the time (Galatians 4:4) at which the
   Messiah appeared, and as one of the beautiful arrangements of him who
   is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working. (Isaiah 28:29.)

   1. Quoniam ecce Dominator Iehova exercituum, Ierosolymae et Judae
   vigorem et vim adimet, omnem vigorem panis, omnem vigorem aquae,

   2. The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and
   the prudent, and the ancient,

   2. Fortem, et virum bellicosum, judicem et prophetam, et divinum et
   senem,

   3. The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor,
   and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.

   4. And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule
   over them.

   4. Et constituam pueros illis principes, et parvuli dominabuntur eis.

   5. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every
   one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against
   the ancient, and the base against the honourable.

   5. Violenter aget populus qisque in alium, vir in proximum suum;
   insolescet adolescens contra senem, contemptus adversus honoratum.

   6. When a man shall take hold of his brother, of the house of his
   father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this
   ruin be under thy hand:

   6. Cum apprehenderit quisque fratrem suum e familia patris sui,
   Vestimentum, dicens, est tibi: Princeps noster eris: ruina haec in manu
   tua:

   7. In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in
   my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the
   people.

   7. Is jurabit in illa die, dicens, Non ero curator; nam domi meae neque
   panis est, neque vestimentum; itaque ne me principem populi
   constituatis.

   8. For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue
   and their doings are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his
   glory.

   8. Certe corruit Ierusalem, et Iuda cecidit; quoniam lingua eorum et
   studia contra Iehovam, ad exacerbandos oculos gloriae ejus.

   9. The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they
   declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not: woe unto their soul! for
   they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

   9. Probatio vultus eorum respondet in ipsis: (vel adversus iposos:)
   peccatum suum, sicut Sodoma, praedicaverunt, neque dissimularunt. Vae
   animae ipsorum, quia accersiverunt sibi malum.

   10. Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him; for they
   shall eat the fruit of their doings.

   10. Dicite justo, bene erit, quia fructus manuum suarum comedent.

   11. Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him; for the reward of
   his hands shall be given him.

   11. Vae impio, male erit; quoniam secundum opera manuum suarum
   rependetur ei.

   12. As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule
   over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and
   destroy the way of thy paths.

   12. Populi mei exactores sunt parvuli, et mulieres illi dominuntur.
   Popule mi, qui te gubernant seducunt, et viam semitarum tuarum
   depravant.

   13. The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.

   13. Stat ad disceptandum Iehova, et praesto est ad judicandos populos.

   14. The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people,
   and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil
   of the poor is in your houses.

   14. Iehova in judicium veniet cum senibus populi sui, et cum
   principibus ejus; et vos perdidistis vineam, estque rapina pauperis in
   domibus vestris.

   15. What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces
   of the poor? saith the Lord God of hosts.

   15. Quid vobis quod contunditis populum meum, et facies pauperum
   commolitis? dicit Dominus Iehova exercituum.

   16. Moreover, the Lord saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
   haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks, and wanton eyes, walking
   and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:

   16. Dicit quoque Iehova, Quoniam superbiunt filiae Sion, et porrecto
   collo incedunt, oculisque vacantibus, et ambulando plaudendoque
   ambulant, tinnitumque pedibus suis excitant:

   17. Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of
   the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their secret parts.

   17. Ideo decalvabit Dominus verticem filiarum Sion, et Dominus pudenda
   earum nudabit.

   18. In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling
   ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like
   the moon,

   18. In die illa auferet Dominus ornamentum crepitaculorum, et reticula,
   et lunulas,

   19. The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

   19. Olfactoria, armillas, et mitras,

   20. The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and
   the tablets, and the earrings,

   20. Tiaras, crurum ornatus, vittas, bullas, et inaures,

   21. The rings, and nose-jewels,

   21. Annulos et monilia narium,

   22. The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples,
   and the crisping-pins,

   22. Mutatorias vestes, palliola, pepla, et acus,

   23. The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

   23. Specula, et sindones, calyptras et theristra.

   24. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall
   be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well-set hair
   baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and
   burning instead of beauty.

   24. Et erit pro suavi aromate putredo, et pro cinctura laceratio, et
   pro cincinnus calvitium; pro balteo cinctura sacci, adustio pro
   venustate.

   25. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

   25. Viri tui in gladio cadent, et robur tuum in bello.

   26. And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she, being desolate,
   shall sit upon the ground

   26. Moerebunt ac lugebunt portae ejus; et ipsa desolata humi jacebit.


   1. For, behold. We stated, a little before, that this is the same
   subject which the Prophet began to treat towards the close of the
   former chapter; for he warns the Jews that their wealth, however great
   it may be, will be of no avail to prevent the wrath of God, which, when
   it has once been kindled, will burn up all their defenses. Hence it
   follows that they are chargeable with excessive madness, when, in order
   to drive away their alarm, they heap up their forces, strength, and
   warlike accoutrements, consultations, armor, abundant supply of
   provisions, and other resources.

   The demonstrative particle hnh, (hinneth,) "behold," is employed not
   only to denote certainty, but to express the shortness of time, as if
   Isaiah caused wicked men to be eye-witnesses of the event; for it
   frequently happens that they who do not venture openly to ridicule the
   judgments of God pass them by, as if they did not at all relate to
   them, or were still at a great distance. "What is that to us?" say
   they; "Or, if they shall ever happen, why should we be miserable before
   the time? Will it not be time enough to think of those calamities when
   they actually befall us?" Since, therefore, wicked men, in order to set
   at naught the judgments of God, dig for themselves lurking-places of
   this description, on this account the Prophet presses them more closely
   and earnestly, that they may not imagine that the hand of God is
   distant, or vainly expect that it will be relaxed.

   The Lord Jehovah of hosts will take away from Jerusalem. This is also
   the reason why he calls God the Lord and Jehovah of Hosts, that the
   majesty of God may terrify their drowsy and sluggish minds; for God has
   no need of titles, but our ignorance and stupidity must be aroused by
   perceiving his glory. First, the Prophet threatens that the Jews will
   have the whole produce of the harvest taken from them, so that they
   will perish through famine. Immediately afterwards he speaks in the
   same manner about military guards, and all that relates to the good
   order of the state. Hence we may infer that the Jews boasted of the
   prosperity which they at that time enjoyed, so as to entertain a
   foolish belief that they were protected against every danger. But
   Isaiah threatens that not only the whole country, but Jerusalem
   herself, which was the invincible fortress of the nation, will be
   exposed to God's chastisements; as if he had said, "The wrath of God
   will not only fall on every part of the body, but will pierce the very
   heart."

   The power and the strength. [49] As to the words vmsnh msn, (mashgnen
   umashgnenah) which differ only in this respect, that one is in the
   masculine, and the other in the feminine genders, I have no doubt that
   the Prophet intended by this change to express more fully the certainty
   that supports of every kind would be broken; and therefore I have
   translated them the power and the strength [50] I do not agree with
   those interpreters who view it as referring to the persons of men, for
   it more appropriately denotes all supports, whatever may be their
   nature.

   Still it is doubtful whether the Prophet limits it to food, or extends
   it to all other kinds of support, which he mentions immediately
   afterwards. But it is natural to suppose that by msn vmsnh, (mashgnen
   umashgnenah) is included generally everything that is necessary to
   sustain the order of the city or of the people; and next that, for the
   sake of explanation, he enumerates some particulars. The first clause
   therefore means, "God will take away every help and assistance by which
   you think that you are upheld, so that nothing whatever may be left to
   support you."

   Next, he adds, what will be their want and nakedness; and he begins, as
   we have said, with food and nourishment, which hold the first rank in
   sustaining the life of men. Now there are two ways in which God takes
   away the strength of bread and water; either when he deprives us of
   victuals, or when he takes from them the power of nourishing us; for
   unless God impart to our food a hidden power, the greatest abundance of
   it that we may possess will do us no good. (Leviticus 26:26.) Hence in
   another passage God is said to break the staff of bread (Ezekiel 4:16,)
   when the bakers deliver the bread by weight, and yet it does not yield
   satisfaction. And this comparison ought to be carefully observed, in
   order to inform us that, even though the belly be will filled, we shall
   always be hungry, there being nothing but the secret blessing of God
   that can feed or support us.

   Though the hunger which the Prophet threatens in this passage may be
   understood to mean that the fields will be unproductive, or, that God
   will take away from the Jews every kind of food, yet, since the
   Prophets are generally accustomed to borrow their forms of expression
   from the law, this interpretation will apply very well. For he might
   simply have said, "I will take away the bread and wine;" but he
   expresses something more secret when he speaks of the support of bread
   and water; as if he had said that, though the people be not reduced to
   famine, yet God will make them, even while they are rioting in
   gluttony, to pine with hunger; for when the blessing of God is
   withdrawn, all its usefulness will vanish away. We may sum it up in
   this manner, that the people will have no food to strengthen them;
   either because they will not have bread and water, or, if they have,
   will derive no advantage from them.

   2. The strong man, and the man of war He mentions other ends which
   contribute to the safety and good order either of nations or of cities.
   Of these he threatens that the Jews will be wholly deprived, so that
   they will neither have wisdom or bravery at battle, nor military forces
   abroad. He is not careful to attend to order, but is satisfied with
   giving a short abridgement, and mixes one subject with another. He
   begins with men of war, into whose hands was committed the defense of
   the country. God sometimes takes them away by death, and sometimes by
   making them soft and effeminate. The latter is more frequent, so that
   posterity degenerates from the bravery of ancestors, and those who were
   formerly courageous become, in process of time, cowardly and unfit for
   war. But we see also that the former sometimes happens, in consequence
   of which the boldest men suddenly lose heart.

   The judge and the prophet. We know that, in the Hebrew language, the
   word judge stands for every kind of governors; and it is certain that
   by prophets are meant every kind of teachers. Accordingly, he threatens
   that the civil government will be set aside, and that instruction will
   be at an end, and that thus the Jews will be destroyed; and, indeed
   magistrates and teachers hold the same place in the commonwealth that
   the two eyes do in the human body.

   Aged diviners and old men [51] I consider the same rank as before to be
   denoted by old men, who are more fit for governing, because age brings
   along with it prudence, wisdom, and gravity. As to the word diviner,
   though it is used in a bad sense in Scripture, yet here it appears to
   be used in a good sense, when Isaiah enumerates those things which
   contribute to preserve the good order of a city and of a kingdoms. The
   term might, therefore, be applied to a soothsayer, who divines or
   penetrates into dark matters, not by omens or superstitious arts, but
   by extraordinary acuteness and skill. But as God forbade them to
   consult magicians, soothsayers, and diviners, (Deuteronomy 18:20,) and
   as Balaam himself declares that there is no divination against Israel,
   (Numbers 23:23,) I do not quarrel with those who would prefer to use
   the word diviner as denoting magical divinations; nor will there be any
   absurdity in enumerating among the punishments of the nation, that it
   would be deprived also of those aids which were sinful and criminal;
   for along with the altar and sacrifices Hosea mentions teraphim. [52]
   (Hosea 3:4.)

   The captain of fifty. He employs this term agreeably to the custom
   which then prevailed; for as the Romans had centurions, or captains of
   hundreds, so the Jews had captains, or rulers of fifties, which the
   Greeks call pentekontarchous, but as that custom did not exist among
   the Latins, so the name was unknown among them. By persons of venerable
   aspect [53] he means those whose reputation for bravery gave then
   influence among the people.

   The senator. [54] The word yvph (yognetz,) for which I have put
   senator, may be applied to men in private life who are eminent for
   prudence; but as it is strictly applicable to counsellors, who
   discharge a public office, I resolved not to depart from the common
   opinion.

   The sinful artificer. Because the mechanical arts are not less
   advantageous for upholding the prosperity of a nation, and for the
   support of animal life, Isaiah likewise mentions that, through the want
   of them, the destruction of the Jews is at hand.

   And the eloquent. [55] he word which is placed last in the enumeration
   has been variously explained by commentators. Literally it means,
   "skilled in muttering, or in a subdued tone of speech. "Now since the
   heathen oracles give out their replies by whisperings or in mutterings,
   some think that the word denotes enchantments. A better exposition is
   given by those who interpret lchs (lahash) to mean secret designs; but
   as a style which is both mysterious and weighty may be not
   inappropriately denoted by this word, I had no hesitation in rendering
   it by the word eloquent. Yet if it be thought preferable to view it as
   denoting wise and cautious men, who, though not qualified for public
   speaking, give private advices of what may profitably be done, I have
   no objection.

   We must attend to this comprehensive description of a well-regulated
   state. For Isaiah has placed first corn and other things necessary for
   bodily support; secondly, military forces; thirdly, skill in governing
   a nation and the various parts of civil government; fourthly, the
   prophetical office; and fifthly, the mechanical arts. With these
   ornaments does God adorn the nations which he intends to render safe
   and sound; and, on the other hand, he takes them from those nations
   which he intends utterly to destroy. Let us, therefore, know that
   everything which we find to be profitable for the support of life flows
   from the undeserved goodness of God. Hence also there follows another
   instruction, namely, that we ought to beware lest, by our ingratitude,
   we deprive ourselves of those excellent gifts of God.

   4. And I will appoint children to be their princes [56] That the
   vengeance of God may be more manifest, he now describes how sad and
   wretched will be the change, when competent and faithful rulers shall
   be taken from among them and God shall put cowardly and worthless
   persons in their room. By children are meant not only those who are so
   by age, but also by mind and conduct, such as delicate and effeminate
   persons, who are destitute of courage and cannot wield the sword
   entrusted to them. He does not here carry out the contrast, clause by
   clause; for he thought it enough to point out one way in which a
   commonwealth is speedily ruined; that is, when its rulers are weak and
   foolish men like children, who have no gravity or wisdom. But it must
   be laid down as a principle, that no man is qualified for governing a
   commonwealth unless he have been appointed to it by God, and be endued
   with uncommon excellence. Plato, too, understood this matter well: for
   though, being a heathen, he had no true knowledge of this kind, yet his
   quick sagacity enabled him to perceive that no man is fit and qualified
   for public government which has not been prepared for it by God in an
   extraordinary measure; for public government proceeds from God alone,
   and in like manner every part of it must be upheld by him. Besides,
   they whom the Lord does not govern have nothing left for them but to be
   children, or rather to be twice children, that is, destitute of all
   skill and of all wisdom.

   Now the Lord executes this vengeance in two ways; because it frequently
   happens, that when we appear to have those who are grave and skillful
   in business, no sooner do they come to action than they stumble like
   blind men, and have no more wisdom than children; for the Lord deprives
   them of that remarkable ability which they had formerly received from
   him, and stuns them, as if he had struck them with a thunderbolt. But
   sometimes the Lord proceeds more gently, and gradually removes men of
   extraordinary ability, who were fit for ruling, and commits the reins
   of government to those who were unable to govern a family, or even a
   single child liken these things happen, it is very certain that
   destruction is not far off.

   Besides, it deserves our notice, as I lately mentioned, that a
   well-regulated commonwealth is a singular gift of God, when the various
   orders of judges and senators, soldiers, captains, artificers, and
   teachers, aid each other by mutual intercourse, and join in promoting
   the general safety of the whole people. For when the Prophet threatens,
   and pronounces it to be a very severe punishment, that these things
   shall be taken away, he plainly shows that those eminent and uncommon
   gifts of God are necessary for the safety of nations. Accordingly, he
   here commends the office of magistrates, and captains, and soldiers,
   and likewise the office of teachers. This deserves our notice in
   opposition to fanatics, who endeavor to banish from the world the power
   of using the sword, together with all civil government and order. But
   the Prophet declares that these things are not taken away or removed
   unless when God is angry. It follows, therefore, that they who oppose,
   and, as far as lies in their power, set aside or destroy such benefits,
   are wicked men and enemies of the public safety.

   He likewise commends instruction, without which a commonwealth cannot
   stand; for, as Solomon says,

   where prophecy is not, the nation must be ruined. (Proverbs 29:18.)

   At the same time, he commends the mechanical arts, agriculture, manual
   occupations of every description, architecture, and such like, which we
   cannot dispense with; for all artisans of every kind, who contribute
   what is useful to men, are the servants of God, and have the same end
   in view with those who were formerly mentioned, namely, the
   preservation of mankind

   The same thing must be said about war; for, although lawful, war ought
   to be nothing else than an attempt to obtain peace; yet sometimes an
   engagement is unavoidable, that they who have the power of the sword
   may use it, and defend themselves and their followers by arms. War,
   therefore, is not in itself to be condemned; for it is the means of
   preserving the commonwealth. But neither must eloquence be despised;
   for it is often needed, both in public and in private life, that
   something may be clearly and fully explained and demonstrated to be
   true. This is also reckoned among the gifts and important blessings of
   God, when a state abounds in wise and eloquent men,

   who can contend with the adversaries in the gate.
   (Psalm 127:5.)

   This passage may be thus summed up, "When God takes away those gifts,
   and alters the condition of a people, in whatever way this takes place,
   either by changing the form of government, or by taking away the
   rulers, the anger of God ought to be acknowledged;" for, as Hosea says,

   He Taketh Away Kings In His Wrath,
   And Appointeth Them In His Indignation. (Hosea 13:11.)

   Let us not, therefore, ascribe these changes to chance or other causes.

   5. The people will oppress every man his neighbor He describes the
   utmost confusion, which was about to overtake the Jews, when order was
   destroyed or relaxed; and this will happen to all nations, as soon as
   government is removed or falls to the ground. We know how great is the
   wantonness of the human mind, when every man is hurried along by
   ambition and, in short, how furious the lawless passions are when they
   are laid under no restraint. There is no reason, therefore, to wonder
   if, when the judgment-seats have been laid low, every man insults his
   neighbor, cruelty abounds, and licentiousness rages without control. If
   we considered this wisely, we would set a higher value on the kindness
   of God, when he preserves us in any tolerable condition, and does not
   allow us to be lamentably ruined. Hence it is evident that they who
   direct or apply their minds to sap the foundations of civil government
   are the open enemies of mankind, or rather, they are in no respect
   different from wild beasts.

   But this confusion described by the Prophet is most disgraceful, that a
   child shall dare to insult an old man, that the dregs of a low and
   despised multitude shall rise up against nobles and men of high
   reputation; for it is the most preposterous of all things that modesty
   shall be thrown away, so that they who were worthy of veneration shall
   be treated with contempt. And yet this spectacle, so shameful and
   revolting, must unavoidably be exhibited when civil government has been
   overthrown. As to my rendering of the verb ngs (niggash) in an active
   sense, to oppress, I was forced to adopt it, for otherwise the meaning
   of the passage would have been imperfect.

   6. When every man shall take hold of his brother As this verse is
   closely connected with the former, and proceeds without interruption as
   far as the phrase he shall swear, the particle ky (ki) is evidently
   taken for an adverb of time. For Isaiah, intending to express the
   extreme wretchedness of the people, says that there will be no man who
   will undertake to govern them, though he were requested to do so. To
   such an extent unquestionably does ambition prevail among men, that
   many are always eager to contend for power, and endeavor to obtain it
   even at the hazard of their lives. In every age the whole world has
   been convulsed by the desire of obtaining kingly power; and there is
   not a villain so inconsiderable as not to contain men who willingly
   undertake to become rulers; and all this proves that man is an animal
   desirous of honor. Hence it follows that everything is in a deplorable
   condition, when that dignity is not only despised but obstinately
   rejected; for the mournful calamity has reached its lowest depth, when
   that which men naturally desire with the greatest ardor is universally
   disclaimed.

   Isaiah mentions other circumstances of an aggravating nature, tending
   to show that the Jews will rather lay aside every feeling of humanity
   and compassion than undertake the office of rulers. If one shall refuse
   to rule foreign nations, it will not perhaps be thought so wonderful;
   but when the preservation of brethren is in question, it is excessively
   unkind to decline the honorable office. It is therefore a proof that
   matters are utterly desperate, when the office of ruler is disdainfully
   rejected by that man to whom his kinsmen appeal, by entreating his
   support and throwing themselves on his protection. Now, since princes
   are commonly selected on account of their wealth, or, at least, kingly
   power is not usually bestowed on any who have not a moderate share of
   riches, lest poverty should lay them open to contempt and reproach, or
   drive them to unworthy means of gain, he likewise adds this
   circumstance, that though they are able to bear the burden, still they
   will not accept of it; as if he had said, "Not only the common people,
   but also the nobles and the wealthy, decline the task of government."

   The phrase take hold is likewise emphatic, for it means to "lay hands"
   on a person; as if Isaiah had said that those who shall wish to obtain
   a prince will not employ flatteries and entreaties, but will proceed
   with disorder and violence to seize on some person, and endeavor to
   compel him to occupy the throne.

   Let this ruin be under thy hand. This last circumstance is not less
   weighty. The meaning is, "At least if you have any compassion or
   humanity, do not fail to aid us in our extreme wretchedness." For when
   a multitude of men, like a scattered flock, bewailing with tears their
   ruinous condition, implore the protection of a shepherd, he who will
   not stretch out a helping hand must have a heart as hard as iron. Some
   translate it as if, by a figure of speech, (hypallage,) one word had
   been put for another, Let thy hand be under this ruin; that is, for the
   sake of upholding it.

   7. In that day shall he swear. The word swear expresses an absolute and
   vehement refusal; for frequently he who at first excuses himself, or
   declares that he will not do it, at length yields to entreaty; but he
   who, in refusing, employs an oath, shuts out all hope, because he gives
   them to understand that his purpose is firm and decided. Perhaps, too,
   the phrase in that day, means "immediately, without any delay, and
   without long consultation;" but as it may also be viewed
   demonstratively, (deiktikos,) as pointing out more fully the time of
   the calamity, I do not express a strong opinion. The general meaning is
   obvious, that their ruinous condition will be past remedy.

   As to the word chvs, (chobesh,) though commentators differ in their
   interpretation of it, yet I cheerfully concur with those who think that
   the metaphor is here borrowed from surgeons; [57] for nothing can more
   fully meet the case. It is as if one, to whom application had been made
   to heal a sick man, should declare that he has no skill in the art of
   healing, or that the disease is too inveterate to admit of being cured.

   The next copulative v, (vau,) means for; as if he had said, "And
   undoubtedly I have not ability to do so." [58] His meaning therefore
   is, that the state of affairs will be so desperate, that no man, even
   when matters are at the worst, will venture to take measures for their
   defense.

   8. For Jerusalem is ruined. Lest it should be thought that God is
   excessively cruel, when he punishes his people with such severity, the
   Prophet here explains briefly the reason of the calamity; as if he had
   said that the destruction of that ungodly people is righteous, because
   in so many ways they have persisted in provoking God. And thus he cuts
   off all ground of complaint; for we know with what insolent fury the
   world breaks out, when it is chastised with more than ordinary
   severity. He says that they were ready, both by words and by actions,
   to commit every kind of crimes. In speaking of their destruction, he
   employs such language as if it had already taken place; though the past
   may be taken for the future, as in many other passages.

   To provoke the eyes of his glory. This mode of expression aggravates
   the crime, as denotes that they had intentionally resolved to insult
   God; for those things which are done before our eyes, if they are
   displeasing to us, are the more offensive. It is true that wicked men
   mock God, as if they were able to deceive him; but as nothing, however
   it may be concealed, escapes his view, Isaiah brings it as a reproach
   against them, that they openly and shamelessly, in his very presence,
   indulged in the commission of crimes. The word glory also deserves our
   attention; for it is a proof of extraordinary madness, if we have no
   feeling of reverence, when the majesty of God is presented to our view.
   If God had so illustriously displayed his glory before the nation of
   Israel, that they ought justly to have been humbled, if they had any
   remains of shame or of modesty. Whatever, then, may be the murmurings
   of wicked men against God, or their complaints of his severity, the
   cause of all the calamities which they endure will be found to be in
   their own hands.

   9. The proof of their countenance will answer in them, or, will answer
   against them [59] As the Prophet had to do with impudent and
   brazen-faced hypocrites, who impudently boasted that they were good
   men; so he says that their countenance testifies what kind of persons
   they are, and that it will not be necessary to bring witnesses from a
   distance, in order to prove their wickedness; for to answer means "to
   bear testimony," or "to confess." Although, therefore, they disguise
   their face and countenance, so that they frequently deceive others, yet
   God compels them to show and prove what they are; so that, in spite of
   themselves they carry, as it were, in their forehead a mark of their
   deceit and hypocrisy.

   Some explain it, that their crimes are so manifest that they cannot
   avoid seeing, as in a mirror, the baseness which they desire to conceal
   But the former meaning is confirmed by what immediately follows, that
   they declared their sin in the same manner as the inhabitants of Sodom.
   By these words he intimates that they devoted themselves to iniquity in
   such a manner, that they boasted of their transgressions without any
   shame; as if it had been honorable and praiseworthy in them to trample
   on every distinction between right and wrong, and not to indulge in
   every kind of wickedness. On this account he compares them to the
   inhabitants of Sodom, (Genesis 18:20; 19:5,) who were so much blinded
   by their lusts, that they rushed, with brutish stupidity, to everything
   base. So, then, this is the answer of the countenance, which he
   mentioned a little before, that they carry about with them plain tokens
   of impiety, which are abundantly sufficient to prove their guilt.

   Woe unto their soul! Here he declares what was formerly mentioned, that
   the whole cause of their calamities is to be found in themselves; for
   by their sins and iniquities they provoked the Lord; and consequently
   that they have no means of evasion, that it is useless to contrive idle
   pretenses, because the evil itself dwells in their bones; as if he had
   said, "God cannot be accused, as if he punished you unjustly.
   Acknowledge that it has been done by yourselves; give glory to a
   righteous judge and lay the whole blame on yourselves."

   10. Say, it shall be well with the righteous Before quoting the
   opinions of others, I shall point out the true meaning As punishments
   so severe commonly present to pious minds an exceedingly sharp
   temptation, and especially since hardly any public calamities occur
   which do not involve good men along with the bad; so the Prophet -- at
   least, in my opinion -- reminds them of the providence of God, which
   never confounds anything, but even, when there is apparent confusion,
   never ceases to distinguish between good and bad men.

   But there are various ways in which this passage is explained; for some
   render it, "Say to the righteous man, because he is good, therefore he
   shall eat the fruit of his hands." From that interpretation this
   meaning is obtained: "I wish and command the godly to be of good cheer;
   for with whatever severity I may punish the crimes of the nation, still
   it shall be well with the godly." But a more suitable meaning is this:
   Say; that is, hold it to be a settled point; for in Scripture to say
   often means to think, and to be convinced; as David writes, I said, I
   will take heed to thy ways, (Psalm 39:1,) and in a thousand instances
   of the same kind; so that he does not bid them tell the righteous man,
   but he bids every man be fully convinced, that happy will be the
   condition of the righteous man, though he may only appear to be
   unhappy.

   Besides, I consider tvv, (tob,) to mean a happy and prosperous
   condition; as in the former verse he employed the word rh, (ragnah)
   with which tvv is now contrasted; and thus I do not think that rh,
   (ragnah,) means wickedness, but a miserable condition. Now since it
   literally runs, Say to the righteous man, ky tvv: (ki tob,) that it
   shall be well either the particle ky, (ki,) has an affirmative sense,
   as in many other passages, or it appears to be superfluous, though the
   probability is, that it is intended for confirmation. Surely it shall
   be well with the righteous man; that is, let every ground of doubt be
   removed, and let us be fully convinced, that the condition of the
   righteous man will be most excellent and prosperous. It is difficult to
   believe this, and therefore it is added, he shall eat the fruit of his
   doings; that is, he shall not be defrauded of the reward of his good
   conduct. Others consider to say as meaning to exhort, and render the
   two words, ky tvv (ki tob,) that he will do well; but I reject it as a
   forced interpretation.

   11. Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him. He brings forward
   this clause as a contrast to the former one; from which it may be
   easily inferred what was the design of the Prophet, namely, to comfort
   the godly, and to terrify the wicked by the judgment of God. For when
   an uncommonly severe calamity occurs, which attacks all without
   discrimination, we doubt whether it be by the providence of God, or, on
   the contrary, by blind chance, that the world is governed. On this
   account godly men fear and dread that the same destruction which
   overtakes the wicked will ruin them also. Others think that it is of no
   importance whether a man be good or bad, when they see both classes
   visited by pestilence, war, famine and other calamities. And hence
   arises the wicked thought, that there is no difference between the
   rewards of the good and of the bad; and in the midst of these gloomy
   thoughts carnal appetites lead many to despair.

   Accordingly, the Prophet shows that the judgment of God is right, that
   men may continue to fear God, and may be aware that those who, in the
   expectation of escape of punishment, provoke God, will not pass
   unpunished. He likewise exhorts them to ascribe to God the praise of
   justice; as if he had said, "Think not that blind chance rules in the
   world, or that God punishes with blind violence, and without any regard
   to justice, but hold it as a principle fully settled in your minds,
   that it shall be well with the righteous man; for God will repay him
   what he hath promised, and will not disappoint him of his hope. On the
   other hand, believe that the condition of the wicked man will be most
   wretched, for he brings on himself the evil which must at length fall
   on his head."

   By these words the Prophet, at the same time, charges the people with
   stupidity in not perceiving the judgment of God; for they suffered the
   punishments of their crimes, and yet hardened themselves under them, as
   if they had been altogether devoid of feeling. Now there cannot befall
   us anything worse than that we should be hardened against
   chastisements, and not perceive that God chastiseth us. When we labor
   under such stupidity, our case is almost hopeless.

   12. The oppressors of any people are children [60] Here also is
   reproved the madness and sottishness of the people, because they shut
   their eyes at noon-day. There is nothing which men are more reluctant
   to allow than to have a yoke laid on them; nor do they willingly submit
   to be governed by nobles. Feeble and cowardly, therefore, must be the
   minds of those who obey delicate and effeminate men, and permit
   themselves to be oppressed by them; nor can it be doubted that God has
   struck with a spirit of cowardice those who offer their shoulders, like
   asses, to bear burdens. The power of a tyrant must indeed be endured,
   even by men of courage; but the reproach which Isaiah brings against
   the Jews is, that while they obstinately shake off the yoke of God,
   they are ready to yield abject submission to men, and to perform any
   services, however shameful or degrading.

   For the Jews could not complain that they were compelled by violence,
   when of their own accord they obeyed those whose authority they would
   gladly have declined. Hence it is evident that they were struck by the
   hand of God, and were shaken with terror, so that they had no strength
   either of body or of mind.

   This is also the vengeance which God had formerly threatened by Moses;
   for the general doctrine of Moses, as we have already said, is
   continually alluded to by the prophets. [61] or how was it possible
   that men who had the power of resistance should of their own accord
   undergo a slavery from which they would willingly have escaped, had not
   God deprived them of understanding and forethought that he might in
   this manner take vengeance on their crimes? Whenever, therefore,
   anything of this kind shall befall us; let us not imagine that it came
   by chance. On the contrary, whenever it shall happen that we are
   governed by men who are of no estimation, and which are more
   insignificant than children, let us acknowledge the wrath of the Lord,
   if we do not choose that the Prophet shall charge us with the grossest
   stupidity.

   They who govern thee [62] He continues to teach the same doctrine, that
   when God lets loose the reins against the wicked, so as to disturb
   everything, he shows that he is highly offended at the Jews; for if
   they had enjoyed his favor, there was reason to hope that his
   government would be most holy and blessed. At the same time it is
   probable that the common herd of men were so foolishly devoted to their
   rulers, that they revered as oracles both their injunctions and their
   conduct; and hence arose all the corruption that everywhere prevailed.
   Since, therefore, the contagion was spreading farther without being
   perceived by the people, Isaiah cries aloud that they ought to guard
   against the governors themselves, who corrupt and destroy the people.

   Others explain it, they who bless thee; but as the participle which he
   employs may be taken from ysr, (yashar,) which signifies to rule, I
   shall rather adopt that interpretation, for it is more agreeable to the
   context. [63] I do acknowledge that the false prophets flattered the
   people, but I see no reason why their flatteries should be mentioned
   here. But it applies very well to the rulers and heads, that they were
   the cause of the destruction; for as princes are raised to their office
   for the sake of the public safety, so no plague is more destructive
   than when they are bad men, and rule according to their own caprice. He
   says, therefore, that they who rule are the causes of the evils, and
   that they corrupt everything, since it was their duty to correct other
   men, and to point out the way by their own example.

   13. Jehovah standeth up to plead So long as wickedness rages without
   control, and the Lord sends no relief from on high, we think that he is
   idle and has forgotten his duty. More especially, when the nobles
   themselves are spared, he appears to grant them liberty to commit sin,
   as if they were most sacred persons that must not be touched.
   Accordingly, after having complained of the princes, he adds that the
   Lord will do what his authority demands, and will not permit such
   flagrant crimes to pass unpunished. For there is hardly any conduct
   more offensive, or more fitted to disturb our minds, than when the
   worst examples of every sort are publicly exhibited by magistrates,
   while no man utters a syllable against them, but almost all give their
   approbation. We then ask, Where is God, whose glory, a great part of
   which, consisting in authority, is taken away, ought to have been
   illustriously displayed by men of that rank? Isaiah meets this
   difficulty by saying, "Though the nation is wicked, yet because the
   princes themselves are very greatly corrupted, and even pollute the
   whole nation by their vices, God sits as judge in heaven, and will at
   length call them to account, and assign to every one his reward."
   Although he does not exempt the multitude from guilt, yet that the
   sources of the evils may be known, he particularly attacks the rulers,
   and threatens them with the punishment which they deserved.

   14. The Lord will enter into judgement with the ancients of his people.
   Formerly he had erected for God a throne from which he might plead. Now
   he says that he will enter into judgment. How? with the ancients. There
   might have been a slight allusion to lawful assemblies, in which older
   men sit as God's deputies; but I assent to the opinion more commonly
   entertained, that God contends against the ancients of his people. This
   passage, therefore, corresponds to the saying of David,

   God will stand in the assembly of the gods (Psalm 82:1; [64] )

   that is, though it may now be thought that princes do everything with
   impunity, and though there be no one to restrain their caprice and
   their lawless passions, yet one day they will feel that God is above
   them, and will render an account to him of all their actions

   These reproofs, undoubtedly, the judges of that time were very
   unwilling to hear. They have no wish, and do not think that it is
   right, that any one should treat them with such sharpness and severity;
   for they wish that everything should be at their disposal, that their
   will should be held as a law, and that they should be allowed to do
   whatever they choose; that all men ought to flatter and applaud them,
   and to approve of their very worst actions. They think that no man is a
   judge of their actions, and do not yield subjection to God himself.
   Since, therefore, they are so unbridled that they neither endure any
   advices nor any threatening the Prophet summons them to the judgment
   seat of God.

   And with their princes They are honorably described, by way of
   acknowledgment, as the chosen princes of the people. This also deserves
   attention; for they thought that, on account of their rank, they
   enjoyed a kind of privilege which set them free from the restraints of
   law, and that though heathen kings and princes might give an account of
   their actions, they, on the contrary, were sacred persons. They
   thought, therefore, that they were beyond the reach of all reproof, and
   ought not to be addressed, like heathen men, by threats and terrors. On
   this account Isaiah expressly declares, that the Lord will not only
   call to account every kind of princes, but especially the proud
   hypocrites to whose care he had committed his people.

   And you have destroyed the vineyard [65] The metaphor of a vine is very
   common, where a nation, and especially the nation of Israel, is the
   subject. (Psalm 80:8; Jeremiah 2:21.) And by this word the Prophet now
   shows their crime to be double, because they paid no more regard to the
   people whom God had loved with extraordinary affection that if they had
   ruled over a heathen nation. The pronoun you is likewise emphatic; for
   he addresses the vine-dressers themselves, who, instead of devoting
   themselves, as they ought to have done, to the cultivation of the vine,
   devoured it like wild beasts. Accordingly, he represents this to be a
   great aggravation of their cruelty; for how treacherous was it to
   destroy what they ought to have preserved and protected? By this
   comparison the Lord shows how great care he takes of his own people,
   and how warmly he loves them; not only because the Church is called his
   vine and inheritance, but by declaring that he will not endure the
   treachery and wickedness of those who have ruled over it tyrannically.

   The spoil of the poor is in your houses. He adds one circumstance, by
   which the other parts of their life might be known, that they had in
   their houses the prey and spoil of the poor. Now the palace of princes
   ought to resemble a sanctuary: for they occupy the dwelling place of
   God, which ought to be sacred to all. It is, therefore, the grossest
   sacrilege to turn a sanctuary into a den of thieves. He represents
   still more strongly their criminality by adding of the poor; for it is
   the most wicked of all acts of cruelty to plunder a poor and needy man,
   who cannot defend himself, and who ought rather to have been protected.

   15. What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces? He mentions also
   other particulars, from which it is evident that they ruled in a
   haughty, cruel and oppressive manner. It was not necessary that the
   Prophet should describe minutely everything deserving reproof in the
   princes; for from these few circumstances it is evident with what
   injustice and cruelty and tyranny they ruled. But to whom shall the
   poor betake themselves but to the magistrate, who ought to be the
   father of his country and the protector of the wretched? On this
   account he employs a vehement interrogation, What? as if he had said,
   "What effrontery is this! What cruelty and barbarity, to abuse the mean
   condition of the poor, so as to have no compassion on them!" By two
   comparisons he describes their cruel oppression mingled with pride.

   Saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts. That the reproof may have all the
   weight that it ought to have, he brings forward God as speaking; for
   there is an implied contrast that these things should not be viewed as
   coming from the mouth of men, but that the accusation proceeds from God
   himself, and that he pursues those who are guilty of such injustice,
   and will at length take vengeance on them. Because those who have been
   exalted to any kind of honor conduct themselves so haughtily as to
   disdain every direction and advice, he therefore meets their pride by
   bringing forward the majesty of God, that they may not venture to
   despise his earnest and severe threatenings. Yet let us remember that
   this passage ought not to be understood as if the Prophet were speaking
   only about the mercy of God; for after having threatened vengeance
   indiscriminately on all, he particularly mentions those who are their
   heads, in order to show that no man can escape the arm of God: and here
   he employs what is called the argument from the greater to the less."
   How would the Lord spare the lowest of the people, when he punishes
   even the princes themselves, because they have destroyed the vineyard?"

   16. Because the daughters of Zion are haughty. Next follows another
   threatening against the ambition, luxury, and pride of women. On these
   points the Prophet has not followed an exact order, but reproves
   sometimes one vice and sometimes another, as the subject appears to
   require, and afterwards sums up what he has said in a few words, as he
   did in the seventh verse of the first chapter. He therefore pronounces
   censure on gorgeous robes and superfluous ornaments, which were
   undoubted proofs of vanity and ostentation. Wherever dress and splendor
   are carried to excess, there is evidence of ambition, and many vices
   are usually connected with it; for whence comes luxury in men and women
   but from pride?

   And walk with stretched forth neck. First, then, he justly declares
   pride to be the source of the evil, and points it out by the sign, that
   is, by their gait; that the women walk with stretched-forth neck For as
   it is a sign of modesty to have a down-cast look, (as even heathen
   writers have declared,) so to have excessively holy looks is a sign of
   insolence; and when a woman lifts up her head it can betoken nothing
   but pride. The Prophet certainly acts wisely in beginning at the very
   fountain; for if he had begun by mentioning signs, such as dress, gait,
   and matters of that sort, it might have been easy to reply that still
   the mind was pure and upright; and that if their dress was somewhat too
   elegant and splendid, that was not a sufficient reason for approaching
   them with such bitter language, and summoning them to the judgement
   seat of God. Accordingly, in order to meet their unfounded accusations,
   he lays open the inward disease, which is manifested in the whole of
   their outward dress.

   And wandering eyes. [66] What he adds about wandering eyes denotes
   shameless lust, which for the most part is expressed by the eyes; for
   unchaste eyes are the heralds of an unchaste heart; but the eyes of
   chaste women are sedate, and not wandering or unsteady.

   And make a tinkling with their feet This is a part of the indecent
   gesture by which wantonness is discovered. But it is not easy to say
   whether the women wore on their sandals some tinkling ornaments which
   made a noise as they walked, or whether they imitated the dancing women
   by a measured step; for the form of dresses since that time has been
   greatly changed. Yet I readily adopt the interpretation that they made
   a noise in walking, for this is very plainly expressed by the word
   employed.

   17. Therefore will the Lord make bald [67] the crown of the head Here
   the particle v, (vau,) which signifies and, is put for therefore; for
   he threatens that, since neither gentle advices nor any words can
   reform them, the Lord will deal with them in a very different manner,
   and will not only employ sharp and severe language, but will advance in
   dreadful array, with an armed band, to take vengeance. Accordingly, as
   they had manifested their obstinacy from head to foot, so he declares
   that the Lord will exhibit the marks of his vengeance in every part of
   their body. He therefore begins with the head, where ornament is
   chiefly bestowed, and afterwards takes notice of the other parts.

   It is worthy of notice that the Prophet had good reason for reproving,
   with so great earnestness and vehemence, the luxury of women; for while
   they are chargeable with many vices, they are most of all inflamed with
   mad eagerness to have fine clothes. Covetous as they naturally are,
   still they spare no expense for dressing in a showy manner, and even
   use spare diet, and deprive themselves of what nature requires, that
   their clothes may be more costly and elegant. So grievously are they
   corrupted by this vice, that it goes beyond every other.

   History tells us what vast crowds the women brought together on account
   of the Oppian Law [68] which some wished to maintain, and others to
   repeal; and that transaction was not conducted with any gravity or
   moderation in consequence of the crowds of women. But we need not go
   far to find examples; for they are innumerable in almost every nation,
   and it is a vice which has been very common in every age. As we are
   dexterous and sharp-sighted in contriving apologies for defending our
   luxury and extravagance, the Prophet, on that account, has pointed his
   finger at the source of all the evils, namely, that mad ambition by
   which men are hurried along to obtain public notice, and to arrive at
   eminence above others; for, in order that they may be better known,
   they wish to outshine their neighbors by the elegance of their dress,
   that they may draw the eyes of others upon them.

   Having pointed to the source of the evil, the Prophet descends to many
   particulars for the purpose of bringing to public view the fooleries of
   women, and enumerates a long catalogue of them, to show that, in
   gathering them together, nothing can exceed the curiosity which dwells
   in woman. Indeed there is no end to those contrivances; and it was not
   without reason that the ancients called the collection of a woman's
   ornaments a world; [69] for if they were collected into one heap, they
   would be almost as numerous as the parts of the world. On this account
   the Prophet appears to search the women's chests, and to bring into
   public view the gaudy trifles which they have treasured up in them,
   that their extravagant delight and boasting of these things may render
   their idleness and folly more evident to all. There is no superfluity,
   therefore, in this enumeration, though spread out in many words, by
   which their lawless desires are proved to be insatiable.

   As to the particulars, I shall not stay to explain them, especially as
   the best Hebrew scholars have doubts about some of them, and cannot
   distinguish with certainty the forms of those ornaments. It is enough
   if we understand the general import and design of the Prophet; namely,
   that he heaps up and enumerates these trifles in order that the
   prodigious variety of them may disclose their luxury and ambition, so
   as to leave them without any excuse. It would be the height of
   impudence to allege that the contrivances made by the childish vanity
   of women, beyond what nature requires, are necessary for protecting the
   body. How many things are here enumerated which are not demanded by
   nature or necessity or propriety! What is the use of chains, bracelets,
   earrings and other things of the same sort? Hence it is plain enough
   that a superfluous collection of such ornaments admits of no excuse;
   that it gives evidence of excessive luxury which ought to be suppressed
   or restrained; and that frequently they are unchaste contrivances for
   weakening the mind and exciting lust. We need not wonder, therefore,
   that the Prophet speaks so sharply, and threatens severe punishments,
   against this vice.

   24. Instead of a sweet smell there shall be stink. It is evident that
   the country here described abounds in aromatic herbs; and there is no
   reason to doubt that in pleasant smells, as well as in other matters,
   they were luxurious. We see that those nations which are farthest
   removed from the east are not prevented either by distance or by
   expense from indulging in that kind of luxury. What may be expected to
   happen in those places where they are abundant? That they will excite
   lust and promote luxury is beyond all doubt He means, therefore, that
   ointments and sweet smells were abused by them in a variety of ways;
   for the sinful desires of men are ingenious in their contrivances, and
   can never be satisfied.

   Instead of a girdle a rent. Others have rendered it a falling off;
   because the Lord will ungird them. He intends to contrast things which
   are exceedingly opposite to each other; that as the women formerly were
   most carefully girt and adorned when they walked, they shall henceforth
   be torn and naked. He likewise contrasts baldness with curls; because
   they arranged their hair not in a modest but an extravagant fashion.
   Again, a belt is contrasted with sackcloth. Whether it was a belt, or
   some other kind of binding, it is certain that the Prophet meant a
   girdle, which was held in high estimation. Again, burning is contrasted
   with beauty; because fashionable ladies hardly venture to expose
   themselves to the sun's rays, for fear of being sunburned; and he tells
   us that this will happen to them. In short, both men and women are
   instructed to make a sober use of the gifts of Goal, both in food and
   in clothing, and in the whole conduct of life. For the Lord cannot
   endure extravagance, and absolutely must inflict severe punishment on
   account of it; for it cannot be restrained by a lighter chastisement.

   25. Thy men shall fall by the sword. He directs his discourse to
   Jerusalem and to the whole kingdom of Judah; for, after having
   demonstrated that the whole body is infected with a plague, and that no
   part of it is free from disease, and after leaving not even spared the
   women, he returns to the general doctrine. It would be improper that
   more than one husband should be assigned to one woman. Besides, what
   immediately follows applies exclusively to this nation. He particularly
   describes the punishment, that God will bring down by wars the whole
   strength of the people.

   26. Her gates shall mourn and lament. Hence arises the mourning of the
   gates, which, he threatens, will take place when they have met with
   their calamities; for he means, that where there were great crowds and
   multitudes, nothing but a dismal solitude will be found. We know that
   at that time public meetings were held at the gates; and, therefore, as
   the gates sometimes rejoice at the multitude of citizens, so they are
   said to mourn on account of their frightful desolation. And yet I do
   not deny that he compares Jerusalem to a woman who is sad, and who
   bewails her widowhood; for it was customary with mourners to sit on the
   ground, as that nation was in the habit of using ceremonies and outward
   signs to a greater degree than would be consistent with our customs.
   But the sum of the matter is that the city will have lost her
   inhabitants.

   fictitious gods, as we read in many places. The King of Babylon is said
   to have consulted the teraphim; and it is said that Rachel stole the

   bind up." His annotator, Breithaupt, explains it thus: "that is, who
   employ any remedy, or apply a plaster, teaching in the school or

   [68] "The Oppian Law," so called from the tribune, Caius Oppius, who
   proposed it, was enacted during the disastrous wars with Hannibal,
   about 213 years before the Christian era. It was to this effect, "That
   no woman should wear on her person more than half an ounce of gold, or
   use garments of variegated colors, or ride in a carriage in any city or
   town, or within a mile's distance of one, unless when she was going to
   observe the public festivals." This law, though extorted by the hard
   necessities of the state, was all along regarded by many persons as
   harsh and tyrannical, and, after producing extraordinary commotions,
   was overwhelmed by the tide of public opinion. Livy informs us (34:1)
   that "ladies, not restrained either by modesty or by the authority of
   their husbands," and neglecting the privacy which belonged to the
   customs of that age, assembled in a tumultuous manner, and publicly
   solicited the votes of the consuls and praetors, and other persons in
   office, for the repeal of the law. Ultimately their chief opponent was
   Cato, who spoke with all his ability and eloquence, but with a
   sternness peculiar to his character, and increased by the nature of the
   question under discussion. He was overmatched by the tact and resources
   of Valerius, who brought to his aid a considerable amount of historical
   information, placed the popular arguments in an advantageous light, and
   succeeded in obtaining an almost unanimous repeal of the law, when it
   had been twenty years in force. Our Author immediately afterwards
   refers to the arguments employed on that occasion. -- Ed

   [69] In the speech already mentioned, Valerius wittily alludes to this
   antiquated use of the Latin word mundus (a world.) "Our ancestors," he
   says, "gave to it the appellation of a woman's world." Hunc mundum
   muliebrem appellarunt majores nostra -- Ed.

   Isaiah Chapter 4:1-6

   1. And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We
   will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; only let us be called
   by thy name, to take away our reproach.

   1. Apprehendent itaque in die illa septenae mulieres viros singulos,
   dicentes, Pane nostro vescemur, vestimentis nostris induemur, tantum
   invocetur nomen tuum super nos, (vel, censeamur tuo nomine,) tollasque
   probrum nostrum.

   2. In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious,
   and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that
   are escaped of Israel.

   2. In die illa erit germen Iehovae in pulchritudinem et gloriam; et
   fructus terrae in praestantiam et decorem; nempe in liberatis Israelis.

   3. And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that
   remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is
   written among the living in Jerusalem:

   3. Et eveniet ut qui reliquus fuerit in Sion, et residuus manserit in
   Ierusalem, sanctus vocetur, omnesque Ierosolymis inter vivos (vel, ad
   vitam,) asscripti erunt;

   4. When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of
   Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst
   thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.

   4. Cum scilicet Dominus eluerit sordes filiarum Sion, et sanguines
   Ierusalem expiaverit e medio ejus, et in Spiritu judicii, et in Spiritu
   incendii (vel, ardoris.)

   5. And the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of mount Zion,
   and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a
   flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.

   5. Et creabit Iehova super totam habitationem montis Sion, et super
   omnem coetum ejus, nubem et obscuritatem interdiu; noctu vero
   splendorem ignis flammantis; quia super omnem gloriam erit protectio.

   6. And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day-time from
   the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and
   from rain.

   6. Eritque obumbratio per diem in umbram ab aestu, in refugium et
   latibulum a nimbo et imbre.


   1. In that day shall seven women take hold of one man He pursues the
   same subject, and unquestionably this discourse is immediately
   connected with what goes before. This verse certainly ought not to have
   been separated from the preceding. By this circumstance he describes
   more fully the nature of that desolation and calamity which he had
   formerly threatened against the Jews; for hypocrites; unless the
   threatening be conceived in strong terms, either disregard or palliate
   warnings, so that God's severity never produces its proper effect upon
   them. From the effect, therefore, he describes the appalling nature of
   the approaching calamity, that they may not indulge the hope of making
   an easy escape. As if he had said, "Do not imagine that it will be of
   moderate extent, lessening your numbers in a small degree; for utter
   destruction awaits you, so that hardly one man will be found for seven
   women."

   The phrase take hold of conveys the same meaning. It is, no doubt,
   inconsistent with the modesty of the sex that a woman should, of her
   own accord, offer herself to a man. But the Prophet says, that not only
   will they do this, but that seven women will, as it were, lay hands on
   a man, and keep hold of him; so small will be the number of men. The
   greatness of the calamity is likewise denoted by what immediately
   follows: we will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel; for as it
   is a duty which belongs to a husband to support his wife and family,
   the women ask a husband for themselves on unreasonable conditions, when
   they release him from all concern about supplying them with food. Very
   great must, therefore, be the scarcity of men, when a great number of
   women, laying aside modesty, are not only constrained to solicit one
   man, but do not even shrink from the agreement to procure their own
   victuals, and request nothing more from a husband than to receive them
   within the bond of marriage.

   Let thy name be called on us. It may be rendered, Let us be called by
   thy name; for when a woman passes into the family of her husband, she
   is called by his name, and loses her own, because the husband is her
   head. (1 Corinthians 11:3.) Hence the vail is a token of subjection,
   and Abimelech said to Sarah,

   Thy husband Abraham shall be a covering to thy head. (Genesis 20:16.)

   But if she remain unmarried, she is concealed under the name of her
   family. That this is the true meaning of that mode of expression is
   sufficiently evident from what Jacob says when blessing his
   grandchildren,

   Let my name, and the name of my fathers,
   Abraham and Isaac, be called on them; (Genesis 48:16;)

   that is, "Let them be reckoned as our descendants, and let them be
   partakers of the covenant, and never excluded from it, as were Esau and
   Ishmael." In the same manner also do heathen writers speak; as, in
   Lucan, Marcia, wishing to return to Cato, says: "Grant me only the bare
   name of marriage; let permission be given that it may be inscribed on
   my tomb, Marcia the wife of Cato." [70]

   And take away our reproach. Their reason for saying so is, that women
   are sometimes treated with disdain, when they do not obtain husbands,
   not only because they appear to be despised as unworthy, but because
   among the ancient people offspring was reckoned an important blessing,
   and therefore the Prophet says that they will be desirous to wipe away
   this reproach, and will employ every argument for that purpose. Lastly,
   he declares that the calamity will be so great, that almost all the men
   will be carried off.

   2. In that day shall the branch of the Lord be for beauty and glory.
   [71] This consolation is seasonably added; for the announcement of a
   dreadful calamity might have alarmed the godly, and led them to doubt
   as to the stability of God's covenant being maintained amidst the
   destruction of the people. For there is a wide difference between the
   two statements, that the people will be like the sand of the sea,
   (Genesis 22:17; Isaiah 10:22,) and yet that they would be cut down by
   such a frightful massacre, that in the remnant there would be found no
   dignity, no magnificence, and hardly any name. Isaiah, therefore,
   according to the custom generally followed by himself and by the
   prophets, provides against this alarm, and, by adding a consolation,
   assuages their excessive terror, that believers may still rest assured
   that the Church will be safe, and may strengthen their hearts by good
   hope. As he spoke of the restoration of the Church in the second
   chapter, so he now promises that a new Church will arise, as a bud or
   shoot springs up in a field which was formerly uncultivated.

   This passage is usually expounded as referring to Christ; and the
   opinion, plausible in itself, derives additional probability from the
   words of the prophet Zechariah:

   Behold the man whose name shall be The Branch.
   (Zechariah 6:12.)

   It is still further strengthened by the consideration, that the Prophet
   does not barely name this Branch, but mentions it with a title
   expressive of respect, as if he had intended to honor the Divinity of
   Christ. When he afterwards adds the fruits of the earth, they consider
   this as referring to his human nature. But after a careful examination
   of the whole, I do not hesitate to regard the Branch of God and the
   fruit of the earth as denoting an unusual and abundant supply of grace,
   which will relieve the hungry; for he speaks as if the earth, barren
   and exhausted after the desolation, would hold out no promise of future
   produce, in order that the sudden fertility might render the kindness
   of God the more desirable; as if the parched and barren fields would
   yield unexpected herbage.

   This metaphor is frequently employed in Scripture, that the gifts of
   God spring up in the world.

   Truth shall spring out of the earth, and
   righteousness shall look down from heaven. (Psalm 85:11.)

   In like manner the Prophet afterwards says:

   Let the earth open and bring forth salvation. (Isaiah 45:8.)

   These words unquestionably denote a rich supply both of spiritual and
   of earthly blessings. That such is the meaning of the passage now under
   consideration is evident from the context; for Isaiah immediately
   afterwards adds, that it will be for honor and lustre to the delivered
   of Israel, [72] that is, to the number left, whom the Lord will rescue
   from destruction.

   The word phlytt (pheletath) is commonly translated escape, but here, as
   in many other passages, it is a collective noun, denoting those who
   have escaped. He declares that the elect will enjoy that happy
   fertility which he had promised, and therefore (verse 3) that those who
   shall be left will be holy. The meaning of the Prophet is, that the
   glory of God will be illustriously displayed when a new Church shall
   arise; as if he would create a people for himself out of nothing, and
   to enrich it with every kind of blessings.

   They who limit it to the person of Christ expose themselves to the
   ridicule of the Jews, as if it were in consequence of scarcity that
   they tortured passages of Scripture for their own convenience. But
   there are other passages of Scripture from which it may be more clearly
   proved that Christ is true God and true man, so that there is no need
   of ingenious glosses. Yet I acknowledge that the Prophet speaks here
   about the kingdom of Christ, on which the restoration of the Church is
   founded. But it ought to be observed, that the consolation is not
   addressed indiscriminately to all, but only to the remnant, which has
   been marvellously rescued from the jaws of death.

   Besides, as it might be deemed a cold consolation if he had only said
   that a small number would be saved, he discourses about the magnificent
   glory and dazzling brightness, to lead believers to hope that this
   diminution will do no harm; because the excellence of the Church does
   not consist in multitude but in purity when God bestows splendid and
   glorious communications of the Spirit of God on his elect. Hence we
   ought to draw a very useful doctrine, that though believers be
   exceedingly few, when they are like brands plucked out of the fire,
   (Zechariah 3:2,) yet that God will glorify himself amongst them, and
   will display in the midst of them a proof of his unspeakable greatness
   not less illustrious than amidst a large number.

   3. And it shall come to pass that he who is left in Zion. He follows
   out the same statement, that when the pollution of the people shall
   have been washed away, what remains will be pure and holy. The
   explanation given by some, that they who shall be found written in the
   book of life will be called holy, appears to me to be too limited.
   These two clauses ought rather to be read separately, that all who
   shall be left in Zion will be holy, and that they who shall be left in
   Jerusalem will be written in the book of life. And this repetition is
   very frequent and customary among the Hebrews, when the prophets set
   forth under various titles the same gift of God. Thus, when it is said,

   There shall be salvation in Jerusalem,
   and forgiveness of sins in Zion, (Joel 2:32,)

   both must be viewed as referring to the same subject; but the grace of
   God is more fully extolled when the cause of salvation is declared to
   consist in a free pardon. [73]

   In this passage the argument is of the same kind; for he says that,
   when the filth shall have been washed away, the Church will be clean,
   and that all who shall have a place in her will truly be the elect of
   God. Now, it is certain that this does not apply universally to the
   external Church, into which many have been admitted under the
   designation of believers who have nothing that corresponds to their
   profession, and who even exceed the small number of good people, as the
   chaff exceeds the wheat in the barn. And although the captivity in
   Babylon had been employed by God, as a sieve, to remove a large portion
   of chaff, yet we know that the Church was still very far from being as
   pure as she ought to have been. But as at that time there was
   displayed, in some measure, a resemblance of that purity which will be
   truly and perfectly manifested after that

   the lambs shall have been separated from the kids,
   (Matthew 25:32,)

   when Isaiah speaks of those beginnings, he includes, as his custom is,
   a period extending to the end, when God will bring to perfection that
   which he then began.

   It is the same thing which we see every day going forward; for although
   chastisements and punishments do not entirely remove all spots from the
   Church, yet when spots have been washed out, she recovers a part of her
   purity. Thus she suffers no loss by the strokes inflicted on her;
   because, while she is diminished, she is at the same time comforted by
   casting out many hypocrites; just as it is only by casting out the
   offensive or corrupt matter that a diseased body can be restored to
   health.

   Hence we obtain a most useful consolation; for we are wont always to
   desire a multitude, and to estimate by it the prosperity of the Church.
   On the contrary, we should rather desire to be few in number, and that
   in all of us the glory of God may shine brightly. But because our own
   glory leads us in another direction, the consequence is, that we regard
   more a great number of men than the excellence of a few.

   We ought also to learn what is the true glory of a Church; for she is
   truly prosperous when the saints have a place in her; though they be
   few and despised in the world, yet they render her condition prosperous
   and desirable. But as it will never happen in the world that the saints
   alone will hold a place in the Church, we ought patiently to endure a
   mixture, and, in the meantime, we ought to reckon it a most valuable
   blessing when she makes a near approach to the cleanness which ought to
   be found in her.

   And they shall all be written among the living [or, to life] in
   Jerusalem. We have already said that by those who are written in the
   book of life are meant the elect of God; as if he had said that the
   profane multitude, which have only a name on the earth, will be cut
   off. The Prophet alludes to a mode of expression which often occurs in
   the Scriptures, as when Moses desires that he should be blotted out of
   the book of life, (Exodus 32:32,) rather than that the whole nation
   should be destroyed. Christ also says to the Apostles,

   Rejoice because your names are written in heaven,
   (Luke 10:20;)

   and Ezekiel says, They shall not be written in the catalogue of my
   people. [74] Now, although God has no other book than his eternal
   counsel, in which he has predestinated us to salvation by adopting us
   for his children, yet this comparison is exceedingly suitable to our
   weakness, because in no other way could our mind conceive that God's
   flock is known to him, so that none of the elect can ever be deprived
   of eternal life. Since, therefore, God has the names of his people in
   some manner written down, the decree of adoption, by which their
   eternal blessedness is secured, is called the book of life. The
   reprobate, though for a time they appear to be on a level with the sons
   of God, are excluded from this catalogue, as we see that they are cut
   off when he collects and separates his own people. This matter will not
   be fully completed before the last day; but as the children of God, by
   continually persevering, when the reprobate fall off, have their
   election made sure, it is no small consolation amidst their
   afflictions, when the temptations by which they are assailed do not
   cause them to fall from their steadfastness.

   4. When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of
   Zion. He still follows out the same statement; for in consequence of
   its being generally believed that those calamities by which the Church
   is diminished inflict upon her grievous injury, the Prophet more
   zealously inculcates the opposite opinion. And now, for the purpose of
   refuting that error, he argues, on the contrary, that by this method
   God washes away the filth, and removes the corruptions, of his Church.

   The blood of Jerusalem. By blood I understand not only murders or other
   atrocious crimes, but defilements and stains of every description. This
   metaphor is a reduplication, (anadiplosis,) by which he repeats the
   same thing twice; for, having formerly spoken of pollution in general,
   he now particularly mentions blood as one kind of ceremonial
   uncleanness. In short, he shows the fruits which spring from God's
   chastisements. By them our spots are washed away. When abounding
   iniquity is not punished, we become corrupted along with others; and
   therefore it is necessary that God should earnestly warn us, and, like
   a physician, apply physic, and the lancet, and sometimes proceed to
   burning

   By the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. Here judgment
   stands for uprightness from its effect; that is, when they who had
   deeply fallen are restored to their former condition. He adds, the
   spirit of burning, by which the filth must be burned and consumed. In
   this expression there are two things to be observed; first, that the
   purification of the Church is accomplished by the Spirit; and secondly,
   that from the effects which he produces the Spirit receives the name,
   sometimes of judgment and sometimes of burning; as if he had said, The
   judgment of the Spirit, The burning of the Spirit. Whenever, therefore,
   expressions of this sort occur in Scripture, "The Lord will do these
   things by the Spirit of truth, of power, of righteousness," we may
   change the expression thus, "by the truth, by the power, by the
   righteousness, of the Spirit." In this manner doth the Spirit of God
   work in us, from whom is both the beginning and the end of our
   salvation. From these terms, therefore, we ought to learn what are the
   chief effects which he produces. By his Spirit the Lord purifies our
   affections that he may renew and sanctify us. The word judgment
   explains what is of chief importance in the restoration of the Church;
   that is, when those things which were confused or decayed are restored
   to good order. Burning points out the plan and method by which the Lord
   restores the Church to her purity.

   5. And Jehovah will create on every dwelling-place of Mount Zion. As if
   he had said that "there will not be a corner of Mount Zion on which the
   grace of God does not shine." Dwelling-place and assembly I understand
   to mean the same thing; for assembly does not here denote a
   congregation, but the place where men assemble. With the design to
   express a full blessing, he alludes to what Moses relates, when the
   Lord delivered the people from Egyptian bondage, and sent

   pillars of cloud by day and pillars of fire by night.
   (Exodus 13:21.)

   It was customary with the prophets, in describing any remarkable
   blessing, to remind them of that deliverance from Egypt as an
   extraordinary work of God; for on that occasion God made a remarkable
   display of the boundless treasures of his grace in establishing his
   Church, and left out no proof of his kindness, in order to make known
   the happiness of that nation. But what chiefly deserved to be
   commemorated was, that by the covering of a cloud by day he protected
   them from excessive heat, and that by night a pillar of fire went
   before them, to prevent them from wandering or going astray.

   It amounts to this, that when God shall bring back the Church from the
   captivity in Babylon, the deliverance will be of a kind not less
   striking and magnificent than when, at an early period, the nation went
   out of Egypt. Not that during their journey from Babylon to Judea they
   would be accompanied, as in the wilderness, by a cloud and a pillar of
   fire, but that he would display his grace and kindness by other methods
   not less remarkable. Just as if we were to say at the present day, "God
   will enlighten us by his Spirit of fire; He will give cloven tongues,
   (Acts 2:3,) to spread his Gospel throughout the whole world." Such
   expressions ought not to be understood literally, as if the Spirit
   would be sent down from heaven under that visible sign; but by
   reminding them of the miracle, it would lead believers to expect that
   the same power of God, which the Apostles formerly experienced, will
   now be displayed in restoring the Church. Add to this, that the
   Prophet, by this mode of expression, points out an uninterrupted
   continuance of blessing; as if he had said, "Not only will God for a
   moment stretch out his hand for your deliverance, but as he always
   accompanied your fathers in the wilderness, so likewise he will deliver
   and protect you to the end."

   For on all the glory shall be a defense. This is connected with what he
   formerly said, that the bud or branch which should afterwards spring up
   would be for glory. It is as if he had said, "on all who shall bear the
   proof and marks of their deliverance." Perhaps also he alludes to the
   passage in which it is related that the destroying angel passed over
   the houses which were marked without doing them any injury, (Exodus
   12:23;) for as the sprinkling of blood at that time protected and saved
   them, so Isaiah promises that believers, when God has marked them, will
   be safe. This must be carefully observed; for we are reminded that we
   shall not become partakers of the grace of God in any other way than by
   bearing his image, and by his glory shining in us.

   6. And a covering in the day-time shall be a shadow from the heat.
   Though the Prophet confirms what we have already noticed, that God will
   be our perpetual guide till he has brought us to the end of our
   journey, yet we are reminded that believers will always be exposed to
   numerous calamities. Scorching heat, and piercing cold, and still
   heavier distresses, press on them severely; when they escape from one
   danger, they meet with another. But the highest consolation is that
   against every inconvenience the shadow of the Lord will of itself be
   sufficient; for it will cover them in such a manner that nothing can
   injure or do them any harm. Although, therefore, various calamities and
   afflictions surround us on every side, still the Lord promises that he
   will assist us; as it is said in the Psalm,

   The sun shall not scorch thee by day, nor the moon by night; for the
   Lord will preserve thee from all evil. (Psalm 121:6, 7.)

   Nothing more is necessary than that we follow our calling, and perform
   our duty faithfully. It belongs equally to the condition of the good
   and of the bad that they suffer many inconveniencies; but bad men have
   no refuge, no place of concealment in which they may hide themselves,
   and they must be utterly overwhelmed. But blessed is the condition of
   the godly; for although they endure heat and cold, still they have a
   safe refuge in God. But that glory of which we formerly spoke must
   shine in us; otherwise we shall have no share in these things; and if
   we carry about with us God's mark, whenever we shall be assailed by a
   tempest, let us rest assured that he will be our protection.

   CHAPTER 5.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah Chapter 5:1-30

   1. Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his
   vineyard. My well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:

   1. Cantabo, agedum, pro dilecto meo, canticum dilecti mei ad vineam
   suam. Vinea fuit dilecto meo in cornu filio olei.

   2. And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted
   it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and
   also made a wine-press therein: and he looked that it should bring
   forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.

   2. Eam sepiverat, et elapidaverat, et plantaverat, ut vineam electam;
   turrim aedificaverat in medio ejus, et torcular in ea construxerat.
   Itaque speravit ut produceret uvas, et producit labruscas.

   3. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray
   you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

   3. Nunc igitur, habitator Ierusalem, et vir Iuda, judicate inter me et
   vineam meam.

   4. What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done
   in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes,
   brought it forth wild grapes?

   4. Quid faciendum fuit amplius vineae meae, quod non fecerim ei?
   Quomodo expectavi ut proferret uvas, et tamen produxit labruscas?

   5. And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will
   take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down
   the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

   5. Et nunc ostendam, agendum, vobis, quid ego facturus sim vineae meae.
   Auferam sepem ejus, ut sit in depastionem: interrumpam maceriem ejus,
   ut sit in conculcationem.

   6. And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned nor digged; but
   there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds
   that they rain no rain upon it.

   6. Faciam ut sit deserta: non putabitur neque fodietur; et ascendet
   sentis et spina. Quinetiam nubibus praecipiam, ne super eam pluant.

   7. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and
   the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but
   behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.

   7. Sane vinea Iehovae exercituum domus Israel est; et vir Iuda palmes
   ejus delectabilis. Inde expectavit judicium, et ecce oppressio;
   justitiam, et ecce clamor.

   8. Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field,
   till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of
   the earth!

   8. Vae qui conjungunt domum ad domum, agrum ad agrum copulant, donec
   non sit locus; ut collocemini scilicet vos soli in medio terrae.

   9. In mine ears said the Lord of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be
   desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

   9. Hoc in auribus Iehovae exercituum, Si non domus multae in
   solitudinem redigantur, magnae et pulchrae absque habitatore.

   10. Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an
   homer shall yield an ephah.

   10. Quinetiam decem jugera vineae facient batum unum, et semen cori
   reddet ephi.

   11. Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
   follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!

   11. Vae qui mane surgunt ad sectandam ebrietatem, et qui tempus ad
   noctem extrahunt, dum vinum accendit eos.

   12. And the harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe, and wine, are in
   their feasts: but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither
   consider the operation of his hands.

   12. Et est cythara, lyra, tympanum, tibia, et vinum, in conviviis
   eorum; opus autem Iehovae non respiciunt; nec opus manuum ejus
   considerant.

   13. Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no
   knowledge; and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude
   dried up with thirst.

   13. Propterea in captivitatem abiit populus meus; quia non fuit
   praeditus scientia; et gloria ejus, viri famis, et multitudo ejus aruit
   siti.

   14. Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without
   measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he
   that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

   14. Propterea dilatavit infernus animam suam, et os suum distendit
   absque modo descenditque gloria ejus; et multitudo ejus, et opulentia
   ejus, et qui laetatus est in ea.

   15. And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be
   humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

   15. Et incurvabitur homo, et humiliabitur vir; oculi inquam sublimium
   humiliabuntur.

   16. But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God, that
   is holy, shall be sanctified in righteousness.

   16. Exaltabitur autem Iehova exercituum in judicio, et Deus qui sanctus
   est sanctificabitur in justitia.

   17. Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places
   of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

   17. Et pascentur agni secundum rationem suam; et desolata pinguium
   advenae comedent.

   18. Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as
   it were with a cart-rope:

   18. Vae trahentibus iniquitatem in funibus vanitatis, et tanquam
   vinculis plaustri peccatum.

   19. That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see
   it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come,
   that we may know it!

   19. Qui dicunt, Acceleret, festinet opus ejus, et videamus;
   appropinquet ac veniat consilium Sancti Israel, ut sciamus.

   20. Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness
   for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet
   for bitter!

   20. Vae qui dicunt malo bonum, et bono malum; qui faciunt lucem ex
   tenebris, et tenebras ex luce; qui vertunt amarum in dulce, et dulce in
   amarum.

   21. Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their
   own sight!

   21. Vae sapientibus in oculis suis, et qui coram seipsis sunt
   prudentes.

   22. Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to
   mingle strong drink;

   22. Vae qui fortes sunt ab libandum vinum, et viris fortibus ad
   miscendam potionem:

   23. Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
   righteousness of the righteous from him!

   23. Qui justificant impium propter munus; justitiam autem justi tollunt
   ab eo.

   24. Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
   consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their
   blossom shall go up as dust; because they have cast away the law of the
   Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

   24. Propterea sicut devorat stipulam lingua ignis, et palea a flamma
   dissolvitur; sic radix eorum quasi putredo erit, et germen eorum quasi
   pulvis vanescet. Quoniam abjecerunt legem Iehovae exercituum, et
   eloquium Sancti Israel aversati sunt.

   25. Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and
   he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them:
   and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the midst
   of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand
   is stretched out still.

   25. Idcirca exarsit furor Iehovae in populum suum; et extendens super
   eum manum suam percussit eum; et contremuerunt montes, fuitque cadaver
   eorum mutilum projectum in medio viarum; et in omnibus istis non est
   aversus furor ejus; sed adhuc manus ejus est extenta.

   26. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will
   hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come
   with speed swiftly.

   26. Et levabit signum ad gentes e longinquo; sibilabit Genti ab extremo
   terrae; et ecce velox et levis veniet.

   27. None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor
   sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the
   latchet of their shoes be broken:

   27. Non erit lassus, neque impingens inter ipsos; nullus dormitabit
   neque dormiet; non solvetur ulli cingulum lumborum, neque rumpetur
   corrigia calceamentorum ejus.

   28. Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses'
   hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.

   28. Sagittae ipsorum acutae erunt, et omnes arcus extenti. Ungulae
   equorum quasi silex; et rotae ipsorum quasi turbo reputabuntur.

   29. Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young
   lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry
   it away safe, and none shall deliver it.

   29. Rugitus ejus sicut leonis; fremet instar leunculorum. Frendet atque
   apprehendet praedam. Spolia corradet, et nemo eripiet.

   30. And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of
   the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow; and
   the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

   30. Fremet super eum in die illo, quasi fremitus maris; tum aspiciet ad
   terram, et ecce tenebrae tribulationis; et lux obtenebrata erit in
   coelis.


   1. Now will I sing to my beloved. The subject of this chapter is
   different from that of the former. It was the design of the Prophet to
   describe the condition of the people of Israel, as it then was, in
   order that all might perceive their faults, and might thus be led by
   shame and self-loathing to sincere repentance. Here, as in a mirror,
   the people might behold the misery of their condition. But for this,
   they would have flattered themselves too much in their crimes, and
   would not have patiently listened to any instructions. It was therefore
   necessary to present a striking and lively picture of their wickedness;
   and in order that it might have the greater weight, he made use of this
   preface; for great and memorable events were usually described in
   verse, that they might be repeated by every one, and that a lasting
   record of them might be preserved. In like manner, we see that Moses
   wrote a song, and many other compositions, (Exodus 15:1; Deuteronomy
   32:1,) in order that all the events might be proclaimed in this manner,
   both in public and in private. The instruction becomes more widely
   diffused than if it had been delivered in plainer language. For the
   same reason Isaiah composed this song, that he might present to the
   people a clearer view of their wickedness; and, undoubtedly, he handled
   this subject with magnificent and harmonious language, for the highest
   skill is commonly exercised in the composition of poems.

   To my beloved. There can be no doubt that he means God; as if he had
   said that he would compose a poem in behalf of God, that he might
   expostulate with the people about their ingratitude; for it gave
   additional weight to his language to represent God as speaking. But a
   question arises, Why does Isaiah call God his friend? Some reply that
   he was a kinsman of Christ, and I acknowledge that he was a descendant
   of David; but this appears to be a forced interpretation. A more
   natural and appropriate one would be, to adopt the statement of John,
   that the Church is committed to the friends of the bridegroom, (John
   3:29,) and to reckon prophets as belonging to that class. To them,
   unquestionably, this designation applies; for the ancient people were
   placed under their charge, that they might be kept under their leader.
   We need not wonder, therefore, that they were jealous and were greatly
   offended when the people bestowed their attachment on any other. Isaiah
   therefore assumes the character of the bridegroom, and, being deeply
   anxious about the bride entrusted to him, complains that she has broken
   conjugal fidelity, and deplores her treachery and ingratitude.

   Hence we learn that not only Paul, but all those prophets and teachers
   who faithfully served God, were jealous of God's spouse. (2 Corinthians
   11:2.) And all the servants of God ought to be greatly moved and
   aroused by this appellation; for what does a man reckon more valuable
   than his wife? A well-disposed husband will value her more highly than
   all his treasures, and will more readily commit to any person the
   charge of his wealth than of his wife. He to whom one will entrust his
   dearly-beloved wife must be reckoned very faithful. Now to pastors and
   ministers the Lord commits his Church as his beloved wife. How great
   will be our wickedness if we betray her by sloth and negligence!
   Whosoever does not labor earnestly to preserve her can on no pretense
   be excused.

   A song of my beloved. By using the word dvdy, dodi, he changes the
   first syllable, but the meaning is the same as in the former clause.
   Though some render it uncle, and others cousin, I rather agree with
   those who consider it to contain an allusion; for greater liberties are
   allowed to poets than to other writers. By his arrangement of those
   words, and by his allusions to them, he intended that the sound and
   rhythm should aid the memory, and impress the minds, of his readers.

   My beloved had a vineyard. The metaphor of a vineyard is frequently
   employed by the prophets, and it would be impossible to find a more
   appropriate comparison. (Psalm 80:8; Jeremiah 2:21.) There are two ways
   in which it points out how highly the Lord values his Church; for no
   possession is dearer to a man than a vineyard, and there is none that
   demands more constant and persevering toil. Not only, therefore, does
   the Lord declare that we are his beloved inheritance, but at the same
   time points out his care and anxiety about us.

   In this song the Prophet mentions, first, the benefits which the Lord
   had bestowed on the Jewish people; secondly, he explains how great was
   the ingratitude of the people; thirdly, the punishment which must
   follow; fourthly, he enumerates the vices of the people; for men never
   acknowledge their vices till they are compelled to do so.

   On a hill. He begins by saying that God had placed his people in a
   favorable situation, as when a person plants a vine on a pleasant and
   fertile hill. By the word horn or hill I understand a lofty place
   rising above a plain, or what we commonly call a rising-ground, (un
   coustau.) It is supposed by some to refer to the situation of
   Jerusalem, but I consider this to be unnatural and forced. It rather
   belongs to the construction of the Prophet's allegory; and as God was
   pleased to take this people under his care and protection, he compares
   this favor to the planting of a vineyard; for it is better to plant
   vines on hills and lofty places than on a plain. In like manner the
   poet says, The vine loves the open hills; the yews prefer the north
   wind and the cold [75] The Prophet, therefore, having alluded to the
   ordinary method of planting the vine, next follows out the comparison,
   that this place occupied no ordinary situation. When he calls it the
   son of oil or of fatness, [76] he means a rich and exceedingly fertile
   spot. This is limited by some commentators to the fertility of Judea,
   but that does not accord with my views, for the Prophet intended to
   describe metaphorically the prosperous condition of the people.

   2. And he fenced it. The incessant care and watchfulness of God in
   dressing his vine are asserted by the Prophet, as if he had said, that
   God has neglected nothing that could be expected from the best and most
   careful householder. And yet we do not choose to attempt, as some
   commentators have done, an ingenious exposition of every clause, such
   as, that the Church is fenced by the protection of the Holy Spirit, so
   that it is safe against the attacks of the devil; that the wine-press
   is doctrine; and that by the stones are meant the annoyances of errors.
   The design of the Prophet, as I have mentioned, was more obvious,
   namely, that by incessant care and large expenditure God has performed
   the part of an excellent husbandman. Yet it was the duty of the Jews to
   consider how numerous and diversified were the blessings which God had
   conferred on them; and at the present day, when the Church is
   represented under the metaphor of a vineyard, we ought to view those
   figures as denoting God's blessings, by which he makes known not only
   his love toward us, but likewise his solicitude about our salvation.

   In the verb planted the order appears to be reversed, for one ought to
   begin with planting rather than with the fence; but my explanation is,
   that after having planted, he did everything else that was necessary.
   Justly, therefore, does he charge them with ingratitude and treachery,
   when the fruits that ought to have followed such laborious cultivation
   were not brought forth. There is reason to fear that the Lord will
   bring the same accusation against us; for the greater the benefits
   which we have received from God, the more disgraceful will be our
   ingratitude if we abuse them. It is not without a good reason, or to
   enable them to make any idle display, that the Lord blesses his people;
   it is, that they may yield grapes, that is, the best fruit. If he be
   disappointed of his expectation, the punishment which the Prophet here
   describes will follow. The mention of his benefits ought, therefore, to
   produce a powerful impression on our minds, and to excite us to
   gratitude.

   Besides, the word vineyard, and a vineyard so carefully cultivated,
   suggests an implied contrast; for so much the more highly ought we to
   value the acts of God's kindness, when they are not of an ordinary
   description, but tokens of his peculiar regard. Other blessings are
   indiscriminately bestowed, such as, that he

   maketh the sun to shine on the evil as well as on the good, (Matthew
   5:45,)

   and supplies them with what is necessary for food and clothing. But how
   much more highly ought we to esteem that covenant of grace into which
   he has entered with us, by which he makes the light of the Gospel to
   shine on us; for his own people are its peculiar objects! That care and
   diligence, therefore, which the Lord continually manifests in
   cultivating our minds deserves our most earnest consideration.

   Therefore he hoped that it would bring forth grapes [77] He now
   complains that the nation which had enjoyed such high advantages had
   basely and shamefully degenerated; and he accuses them of undervaluing
   the kindness of God, for he says that, instead of pleasant grapes, they
   yielded only wild and bitter fruits. It is undoubtedly true that God,
   to whose eyes all things are naked and opened, (Hebrew 4:13,) is not
   deceived by his expectation like a mortal man. In the Song of Moses he
   plainly declares that he well knew from the beginning what would be the
   wickedness of his people.

   My beloved, says he, when she fares well and becomes fat,
   will kick. (Deuteronomy 32:15.)

   It is therefore not more possible that God should be mistaken in his
   expectations, than that he should repent. Isaiah does not here enter
   into subtle reasonings about the expectations which God had formed, but
   describes the manner in which the people ought to have acted, that they
   might not lose the benefit of such excellent advantages. Thus God
   commands that the Gospel be proclaimed for the obedience of faith,
   (Romans 16:26,) not that he expects all to be obedient, but because, by
   the mere hearing of it, unbelievers are rendered inexcusable. Moreover,
   there is nothing that ought to excite us more powerfully to lead a
   devout and holy life, than to find that those duties which we perform
   towards God are compared by the Holy Spirit to fruits of exquisite
   flavour.

   3. Now, therefore, O inhabitant of Jerusalem! Those persons with whom
   he contends are made judges in their own cause, as is usually done in
   cases so plain and undoubted that the opposite party has no means of
   evasion. It is, therefore, a proof of the strongest confidence in his
   cause, when he bids the guilty persons themselves declare if this be
   not the true state of the fact; for immediately afterwards we shall
   find him declaring that the accusation is decided against those persons
   to whom he now commits the decision.

   4. What more ought to have been done to my vineyard? He first inquires
   what could have been expected from the best husbandman or householder,
   which he has not done to his vineyard? Hence he concludes that they had
   no excuse for having basely withheld from him the fruit of his toil.

   How did I expect that it would yield grapes? In this clause he appears
   to expostulate with himself for having expected any good or pleasant
   fruit from so wicked a people; just as, when the result does not answer
   to our expectation, we complain of ourselves, and are angry at having
   ill-bestowed our labor on ungrateful persons whose wickedness ought to
   have restrained us from doing what we did, and acknowledge that we are
   justly deceived, because we were too simple and easily imposed on. But
   a more natural interpretation will be this: "Since I discharged every
   part of my duty, and did more than any one could have expected in
   dressing my vineyard, how comes it that it yields me so poor a return,
   and that, instead of the fruit which was expected, it yields what is
   absolutely bitter?"

   If it be objected that God had the remedy in his hands, if he had
   turned the hearts of the people, this is an idle evasion as applied to
   those men; for their conscience holds them fast, so that they cannot
   escape by laying the blame on another. Though God do not pierce the
   hearts of men by the power of his Spirit, so as to render them obedient
   to him, yet they will have no right to complain that this was wanting;
   for every pretense of ignorance is fully and abundantly taken away by
   the outward call. Besides, God does not speak here of his power, but
   declares that he was not under any obligation to do more than he did.

   5. And now come, I will show you what I will do to my vineyard. Having
   held the Jews to be condemned, as it were, by their own mouth, he next
   adds that he will take vengeance for their contempt of his grace, so
   that they will not escape from being punished. The reproof would not
   have been sufficiently powerful to affect their minds, if he had not
   also threatened punishment; and therefore he now declares that the
   heinous offense, of having wickedly imposed on him, will not escape
   vengeance. Now the punishment to be inflicted on them amounts to this,
   that they will be deprived of the gifts which they had abused, when God
   shall not only withdraw his care of them, but shall give them up to be
   plundered by their enemies. At the same time he shows how wretched
   their condition will be, when God shall have ceased to bestow on them
   his multiplied favors.

   Hence it follows that it must have been owing entirely to the
   extraordinary goodness of God, that the vineyard remained safe and
   uninjured till that time. He goes so far as to point out the various
   supports by which it was upheld, and the vast resources which God
   possesses for destroying it both within and without; for when his
   protection has been removed, they must become a prey to all that pass
   by, whether men or beasts. "When the fence has been removed," says he,
   "the cattle will tread on it and lay it bare, robbers will ransack and
   plunder it, and thus it will become a wilderness."

   6. I will lay it waste. God will not take pains to dig and prune it,
   and consequently it will become barren for want of dressing; briars and
   thorns will spring up to choke its branches; and, what is more, by
   withholding rain, God will dry up its roots. Hence it is evident how
   manifold are the weapons with which God is supplied for punishing our
   ingratitude, when he sees that we despise his kindness. Isaiah is
   still, no doubt, proceeding with his metaphor, and, in order to obtain
   more eager attention, adorns his style by figures of speech. But we
   ought simply to conclude, that as God continually bestows on us
   innumerable benefits, so we ought to be earnestly on our guard lest, by
   withdrawing first one and then another, he punish us for despising
   them.

   So far as relates to the government of the Church, the more numerous
   the kinds of assistance which she needs, the more numerous are the
   punishments to which she will be liable, if she wickedly corrupt what
   was appointed by God for her salvation. Nor ought we to wonder, if at
   the present day so many distresses threaten ruin and desolation; for
   whatever calamity befalls us, whether it be that there is a deficiency
   of instruction, or that the wicked abound, or that foxes and wolves
   creep into the Church, all this must be ascribed to our ingratitude,
   because we have not yielded such fruit as we ought, and have been
   indolent and sluggish. Whenever, therefore, we are justly deprived of
   those great favors which he freely bestowed on us, let us acknowledge
   the anger of the Lord.

   7. Truly the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel.
   Hitherto he spoke figuratively; now he shows what is the design of this
   song. Formerly he had threatened judgment against the Jews; now he
   shows that they are not only guilty, but are also held to be convicted
   persons; for they could not be ignorant of the benefits which they had
   received from God.

   Thou broughtest a vine from Egypt, says the Psalmist, and, having
   driven out the nations, plantedst it. (Psalm 80:8.)

   Their ingratitude was plain and manifest.

   Isaiah does not illustrate every part of the metaphor; nor was it
   necessary; for it was enough to point out what was its object. The
   whole nation was the vineyard; the individual men were the plants. Thus
   he accuses the whole body of the nation, and then every individual; so
   that no man could escape the universal condemnation, as if no part of
   the expostulation had been addressed to himself. Why the nation is
   called a vineyard is plain enough; for the Lord chose it, and admitted
   it to the covenant of grace and of eternal salvation, and bestowed on
   it innumerable blessings. The planting is the commencement, and the
   dressing of it follows. That nation was adopted, and in various
   respects was the object of Divine care; for the adoption would have
   been of no avail, if the Lord had not continually adorned and enriched
   it by his blessings.

   The same doctrine ought to be inculcated on us at the present day.
   Christ affirms that he is the vine, (John 15:1,) and that, having been
   ingrafted into this vine, we are placed under the care of the Father;
   for God is pleased to perform towards us the office of a husbandman,
   and continually bestows those favors which he reproachfully asserts
   that he had granted to his ancient people. We need not wonder,
   therefore, if he is greatly enraged when he bestows his labor uselessly
   and to no purpose. Hence that threatening,

   Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he will cut off,
   and cast into the fire. (John 15:2,6.) [78]

   He looked for judgment. He begins without a metaphor to relate how
   wickedly the Jews had degenerated, among whom equity and justice was
   despised, and every kind of injustice and violence abounded. The words
   contain an elegant play of language, (paronomasia,) for those which
   have nearly the same sound have an opposite meaning. mspht (mishpat)
   denotes judgment; msphch (mishpach) denotes conspiracy or oppression;
   tsdqh (tzedakah) denotes righteousness; tsqh (tzeakah) denotes the cry
   and complaint of those who are oppressed by violence and injustice;
   sounds which are not wont to be heard where every man receives what is
   his own. He mentions two things which the Lord chiefly demands from his
   people as the genuine fruits of the fear of God; for although piety
   comes first in order, yet there is no inconsistency in taking the
   description of it from the duties of the second table. They are justly
   charged with having despised God, on the ground of having acted cruelly
   towards men; for where cruelty reigns, religion is extinguished.

   Let us now understand that the same things are addressed to us; for as
   that nation was planted, so were we. We should call to remembrance what
   Paul says, that we were like wild olive-plants, but that they were the
   true and natural olive-tree. (Romans 11:24. [79] ) since we who were
   strangers have been ingrafted into the true olive-tree, the Lord has
   cultivated and adorned us with unceasing care. But what kind of fruits
   do we bring forth? Assuredly they are not only useless, but even
   bitter. So much the greater is the ingratitude for which we ought to be
   condemned, for the blessings which he has bestowed and heaped on us are
   far more abundant. And justly does this expostulation apply to us, for
   violence and injustice abound everywhere. But since the general
   doctrine did not strike their minds so powerfully, the Prophet
   described chiefly these two kinds of wickedness; that he might point
   out with the finger, as it were, how far that nation was from the fruit
   which a good vineyard ought to have yielded.

   8. Woe to them that join house to house and field to field. He now
   reproves their insatiable avarice and covetousness, from which the acts
   of cheating, injustice, and violence are wont to arise. For it cannot
   be condemned as a thing in itself wrong, if a man add field to field
   and house to house; but he looked at the disposition of mind, which
   cannot at all be satisfied, when it is once inflamed by the desire of
   gain. Accordingly, he describes the feelings of those who never have
   enough, and whom no wealth can satisfy. So great is the keenness of
   covetous men that they desire to have everything possessed by
   themselves alone, and reckon everything that is obtained by others to
   be something which they want, and which has been taken from them. Hence
   the beautiful observation of Chrysostom, that "covetous men, if they
   could, would willingly take the sun from the poor," for they envy their
   brethren the common elements, and would gladly swallow them up; not
   that they might enjoy them, but because such is the madness to which
   their greed carries them. All the while they do not consider that they
   need the assistance of others, and that a man left alone can do
   nothing: all their care is to scrape together as much as they can, and
   thus they swallow up everything by their covetousness.

   He therefore accuses covetous and ambitious men of such folly that they
   would wish to have other men removed from the earth, that they might
   possess it alone; and consequently they set no limit to their desire of
   gain. For what madness is it to wish to have those driven away from the
   earth whom God has placed in it along with us, and to whom, as well as
   to ourselves, he has assigned it as their abode! Certainly nothing more
   ruinous could happen to them than to obtain their wish. Were they
   alone, they could not plough, or reap, or perform other offices
   indispensable to their subsistence, or supply themselves with the
   necessaries of life. For God has linked men so closely together, that
   they need the assistance and labor of each other; and none but a madman
   would disdain other men as hurtful or useless to him. Ambitious men
   cannot enjoy their renown but amidst a multitude. How blind are they,
   therefore, when they wish to drive and chase away others, that they may
   reign alone!

   As to the size of houses, the same remark which we formerly made about
   fields will apply; for he points out the ambition of those who are
   desirous to inhabit spacious and magnificent houses. If a man who has a
   large family makes use of a large house, he cannot be blamed for it;
   but when men, swollen with ambition, make superfluous additions to
   their houses, only that they may live in greater luxury, and when one
   person alone occupies a building which might serve for the habitation
   of many families, this undoubtedly is empty ambition, and ought justly
   to be blamed. Such persons act as if they had a right to drive out
   other men, and to be the only persons that enjoyed a house or a roof,
   and as if other men ought to live in the open air, or must go somewhere
   else to find an abode.

   9. This is in the ears of Jehovah of hosts. Here something must be
   supplied; for he means that the Lord sits as judge, and as taking
   cognizance of those things. When covetous men seize and heap up their
   wealth, they are blinded by their desire of gain, and do not understand
   that they will one day render an account. Never, certainly, were men so
   utterly stupid as not to ascribe some judgment to God; but they flatter
   themselves so far as to imagine that God does not observe them. In
   general, therefore, they acknowledge the judgment of God: when they
   come to particular cases, they take liberties, and suppose that they
   are not bound to proceed to that extent.

   If many houses be not laid desolate. Having warned them that none of
   these things escape the eyes of God, lest they should imagine that it
   is a knowledge which does not lead to action, he immediately adds, that
   vengeance is close at hand. He likewise makes use of an oath; for the
   expression If not is a form of swearing that frequently occurs in the
   Scriptures. [80] In order to strike them with greater terror he breaks
   off the sentence with studied abruptness. [81] He might indeed have
   brought out this threatening with full expression, but the incomplete
   form is better fitted to keep the hearer in doubt and suspense, and is
   therefore more alarming. Besides, by this instance of reserve the Lord
   intended to train us to modesty, that we may not be too free in the use
   of oaths.

   But what does he threaten? Many houses will be laid desolate. This is a
   just punishment, by which the Lord chastises the covetousness and
   ambition of men, who did not consider their own meanness, that they
   might be satisfied with a moderate portion. In a similar manner the
   poet ridicules the mad ambition of Alexander the Great, who having
   learned from the philosophy of Anacharsis that there were many worlds,
   sighed to think, that after having worn himself out by so many toils,
   he had not yet made himself master of one world. "One globe does not
   satisfy the Macedonian youth. He writhes in misery on account of the
   narrow limits of the world, as if he were confined to the rocks of
   Gyaros, or to the puny Seriphos. But when he shall enter the city
   framed by potters, he will be content with a tomb. Death alone
   acknowledges how small are the dimensions of the bodies of men." [82]

   Instances of the same kind occur every day, yet we do not observe them;
   for the Lord exhibits to us, as in a mirror, the absurd vanity of men,
   who spend a vast amount of money in building palaces that are
   afterwards to become the receptacles of owls and bats and other
   animals. These things are plainly before our eyes, and yet we do not
   apply our mind to the consideration of them. So sudden and various are
   the changes that happen, so many houses are laid desolate, so many
   cities are overthrown and destroyed, and, in short, there are so many
   other evident proofs of the judgment of God; and yet men cannot be
   persuaded to lay aside this mad ambition. The Lord threatens by the
   Prophet Amos:

   "You have built houses of hewn stones,
   but you shall not dwell in them." (Amos 5:11.)

   And again,

   "He will smite the great house with breaches,
   and the little house with clefts." (Amos 6:11.)

   These things happen daily, and yet the lawless passions of men are not
   abated.

   10. Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath. He foretells that
   the same thing will befall their fields and vineyards; that covetous
   men will not obtain the desired returns, because their greed is
   insatiable; that, like certain animals which, by their breath, scorch
   the branches, and wither the corn, those men destroy the fruits of the
   earth by their extortion. The fields will be so barren as scarcely to
   yield a tenth part of the seed: the vineyards will yield very little
   wine.

   A bath, as Josephus tells us, is a measure of liquids, and contains
   seventy-two sextaries; a very small measure, certainly, for ten acres,
   especially on a fertile soil. The cor (koros) or homer, is a measure of
   dry substances, and, according to the same author, contains thirty-one
   medimni [83] An ephah is the tenth part of it, and therefore evidently
   contains a little more than three medimni [84]

   Now, when the soil is productive, it yields not only tenfold, but
   thirtyfold, and in all cases goes beyond the quantity of seed, and
   gives back far more abundantly than it received. When the case is
   otherwise, it undoubtedly proceeds from the curse of God punishing the
   extortion of men. And yet men blame the niggardliness of the soil, as
   if the fault lay there, but all in vain; for we would not want abundant
   increase, if God did not curse the soil on account of men's
   covetousness. When they are so eagerly employed in gathering and
   heaping up, what else are they doing than swallowing up the goodness of
   God by their greed? If this is not seen in all, because they want the
   power, still they do not want the disposition. Never was the world so
   much inflamed by this covetousness, and we need not wonder if God visit
   it with punishment.

   11. Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning to follow strong
   drink The Prophet does not aim at an enumeration of all the vices which
   then prevailed, but only points out some particular kinds of them, to
   which they were peculiarly addicted. After having handled the general
   doctrine, he found it necessary to come to particular vices; and the
   enumeration of those was more urgently needed, for there would have
   been no end of going through them all one by one. Having reproved
   covetousness, he now attacks drunkenness, which undoubtedly was also a
   prevailing vice; for the kinds of vices which he selects are not those
   which were found in one person or another, but those which universally
   prevailed; and indeed the vices are of such a kind as infect the whole
   body by their contagion.

   To rise early means to be earnestly employed in doing anything; as when
   Solomon says,

   Woe to the nation whose princes eat in the morning,
   (Ecclesiastes 10:16;)

   that is, whose chief care is to fill their belly and enjoy delicacies.
   This is contrary to the order of nature; for man, as David says,

   "riseth that he may go to his work, and may be engaged in business till
   the evening." (Psalms 104:23.)

   Now, if he lay aside his labors, and rise to partake of luxuries, and
   to follow drunkenness, this is monstrous. He adds --

   And who continue till night. The meaning is, that from the dawn of the
   morning to the twilight of the evening they continue their drunken
   carousals, and are never weary of drinking. Abundance and luxury are
   closely joined together; for when men enjoy abundance, they become
   luxurious, and abuse it by intemperance.

   12. And the harp. He adds the instruments of pleasures by which men
   addicted to intemperance provoke their appetite. These might be
   different from ours, but they belonged to music. Now, Isaiah does not
   blame music, for it is a science which ought not to be despised; but he
   describes a nation swimming in every kind of luxury, and too much
   disposed to indulge in pleasures. This is sufficiently evident from
   what follows.

   And they regard not the work of the Lord As if he had said, "They are
   as constant in luxurious indulgence, and as much devoted to it, as if
   this had been the purpose for which they were born and reared; and they
   do not consider why the Lord supplies them with what is necessary." Men
   were not born to eat and drink, and wallow in luxury, but to obey God,
   to worship him devoutly, to acknowledge his goodness, and to endeavor
   to do what is pleasing in his sight. But when they give themselves up
   to luxury, when they dance, and sing, and have no other object in view
   than to spend their life in the highest mirth, they are worse than
   beasts: for they do not consider for what end God created them, in what
   manner he governs this world by his providence, and to what end all the
   actions of our life ought to be directed.

   Having stated this meaning, which appears to me to be natural, I
   consider nothing more to be necessary; for I cannot adopt the ingenious
   expositions of some authors, such as, when they explain the work of God
   to mean the law; nor did I intend to state every opinion which others
   have maintained. It is enough to know that all who are addicted to
   gormandizing are here subjected by the Prophet to the reproach of
   voluntarily becoming like brute beasts, when they do not direct their
   minds to God, who is the author of life.

   13. Therefore my people are gone into captivity. I do not approve of
   the interpretation given by some commentators, that in consequence of
   the teachers having failed to perform their duty, the people, through
   ignorance and error, fell into many vices, which at length became the
   cause of their destruction. On the contrary, he charges them with gross
   and voluntary ignorance, as if he had said that, by their madness, they
   brought down destruction on themselves. The meaning therefore is, that
   the people perished because they despised instruction; whereas they
   might have been preserved if they had listened to good counsels: and
   therefore he expressly says, My people; that is, the nation which
   enjoyed the extraordinary privilege of being separated from the rest of
   the nations, that by relying on the guidance and direction of God, they
   might have a fixed rule of life. Thus it is said,

   "What nation is so eminent and so distinguished as to have gods nigh to
   it, as thy God draws near to thee this day? This shall therefore be
   your knowledge and understanding above all nations, to hear your God."
   (Deuteronomy 4:6, 7.)

   This baseness heightens the criminality of the people, that they shut
   their eyes in the midst of so much light. It was therefore a very
   severe accusation, that a people which God had undertaken to govern
   possessed no knowledge: for the law might have given them abundant
   direction for the whole conduct of life; it was a light shining before
   them amidst the general darkness of the world; and therefore it was
   monstrous that the nation should refuse to follow that path which had
   been pointed out to them, and, on the contrary, should shut their eyes,
   and rush forward to destruction.

   Have gone into captivity. Some consider the word captivity to be used
   here in a metaphorical sense; but this is a forced interpretation; for
   the Prophet here describes the punishments which God had in part
   inflicted, and in part intended to inflict, so as to make it evident
   that the people were wretched through their own fault, as if they
   wished to draw down upon themselves the curses of God. When this
   discourse was delivered, some tribes of Israel had already been
   banished, and the destruction of both kingdoms was at hand. The Prophet
   accordingly speaks as if all had already been led into captivity

   And their glory are men famished [85] and their multitude are dried up
   with thirst. He now adds another punishment, namely, that they are
   wasted with hunger and famine, and not only common men, but some
   persons of the highest rank, in whom the vengeance of God is more
   clearly seen; for it was shocking to see wealthy men and nobles, on
   whom the respectability of the whole nation rested, wandering about and
   famished. And yet the severity of God's vengeance did not exceed proper
   bounds; for we must always take into account that ignorance was the
   cause; that is, the Jews were rebellious, and obstinately rejected the
   light of heavenly doctrine; yea, shut their ears against God when he
   was willing to perform the part of a master in instructing them. Hence
   we draw a useful doctrine; namely, that the source of all our
   calamities is, that we do not allow ourselves to be taught by the word
   of God, and this is what the Prophet chiefly intended that we should
   observe.

   It may be asked, Is ignorance the cause of all calamities? Many persons
   appear to sin not so much through ignorance as through obstinacy; for
   they see what is right, but refuse to follow it, and the consequence is
   that they sin willingly, and not merely through inadvertency. I answer,
   ignorance is sometimes the near, and sometimes the remote cause; or, to
   use the common expressions, the one is immediate, and the other is
   mediate. It is the near cause, when men deceive themselves under any
   pretense, and intentionally blind their understanding. Again, it is the
   remoter cause, when men reject the principles from which they ought to
   frame the rule of their life; for it was their duty to look to God, and
   to attend to his will. When they disregard his will, they are indeed
   rebellious and obstinate; but they are ignorant because they refuse to
   learn, and on this rock they split: and yet ignorance does not excuse
   them, for of their own accord they bring it on themselves when they
   reject such a Teacher. So then it is a true statement, that the reason
   why the people endure such a variety of afflictions is, that they are
   ignorant of God, and will not allow themselves to be taught by him.

   14. Therefore hell hath enlarged his soul [86] In this verse the
   Prophet intended to heighten the alarm of men who were at their ease,
   and not yet sufficiently affected by the threatenings which had been
   held out to them. Though it was shocking to behold captivity, and also
   famine, yet the slowness and insensibility of the people was so great
   that they did not give earnest heed to these tokens of God's anger.
   Accordingly the Prophet threatens something still more dreadful, that
   hell has opened his belly to swallow them all up.

   I said a little ago, that what is here stated in the past tense refers
   partly to the future. Nor is it without good reason that the Prophet
   speaks of the events as plain and manifest; for he intended to bring
   them immediately before the people, that they might behold with their
   eyes what they could not be persuaded to believe. Again, when he
   compares hell or the grave to an insatiable beast, by the soul he means
   the belly into which the food is thrown. The general meaning is, that
   the grave is like a wide and vast gulf, which, at the command of God,
   yawns to devour men who are condemned to die. This personification
   carries greater emphasis than if he had said that all are condemned to
   the grave.

   And her glory hath descended, and her multitude. He joins together the
   nobles and men of low rank, that none may flatter themselves with the
   hope of escape: as if he had said, "Death will carry you away, and all
   that you possess, your delicacies, wealth, pleasures, and everything
   else in which you place your confidence." It is therefore a
   confirmation of the former statement, and we ought always to attend to
   the particle lkn (laken,) therefore; for the people ascribed their
   calamities to fortune, or in some other way hardened themselves against
   the Lord's chastisements. On this account Isaiah says that these things
   do not happen by chance. Besides, men are wont to argue with God, and
   are so daring and presumptuous that they do not hesitate to call him to
   account. In order, therefore, to restrain that pride, he shows that the
   punishments with which they are visited are just, and that it is owing
   entirely to their own folly that they are miserable in every respect.

   15. And the mighty man shall be bowed down. This may be called the
   summing up, for it points out the end and result of those
   chastisements, that all may be cast down, and that the Lord alone may
   be exalted. We have formerly met with a similar statement, (Isaiah
   2:11,17,) and on that occasion we explained what was the Prophet's
   meaning; [87] which is, that he shows the design of the chastisements
   which God inflicts on us. Adversity is so hateful to us, that we can
   perceive nothing good in it. When he speaks of punishments, we detest
   and abhor them, because we do not perceive the justice of God. But the
   prophets remind us of another consideration, that so long as men go on
   in their sins regardlessly, the justice of God is in some degree
   smothered, and never shines so brightly as when he punishes our sins.
   This fruit is indeed very great, and ought to be preferred to the
   salvation of all men; for the glory of God, which shines in his
   righteousness, ought to be more highly esteemed than all things else.

   There is, therefore, no reason why we should so greatly dread the
   chastisements which God inflicts upon us, but we ought to embrace with
   reverence what the prophets declare concerning them. In this way,
   however, the Prophet has severely chastised arrogant hypocrites. who
   become the more insolent when they are not punished; as if he had said,
   "Do you imagine that, when God has endured you so long, you will at
   last be able to tread him under your feet? Assuredly he will arise, and
   will be exalted in your destruction."

   As the Prophet has employed, first, the word 'dm (adam) and next 'ys
   (ish), it is supposed that this denotes both the noble and the mean; as
   if he had said, "Not only will the common people perish, but likewise
   those who are eminent for riches, honor, and high rank." I cheerfully
   adopt this opinion; for 'ys (ish) is derived from strength and 'dm
   (adam) from earth. But if any one prefer a more simple interpretation,
   I leave it to his judgment. However this may be, the Prophet includes
   all men, both the highest and the lowest.

   16. But Jehovah of hosts shall be exalted in judgment. He expresses the
   manner, or, as it is commonly called, the formal cause, of the
   excellence of which he has spoken; as if he had said, "The God of
   hosts, whom ungodly men insolently tread under their feet, will be
   raised on high, when he shall show himself to be the judge of the
   world." In this manner he ridicules the foolish confidence with which
   the ungodly vaunted; for if judgment and righteousness must at length
   come forth, it follows that they shall be cast down, since the only way
   in which those men rise is by overturning the order of nature. And it
   ought to be carefully observed, that it is not more possible for wicked
   men to continue in prosperity than for God to permit his glory to be
   set aside. Though judgment is not at all different from righteousness,
   still the repetition is not superfluous.

   And God, who is holy, shall be sanctified in righteousness. The
   language becomes more vehement, that wicked men may not, by a false
   imagination, assure themselves of uninterrupted happiness, which they
   cannot have, unless by setting aside the holiness of God. But since God
   is holy by nature, he must be sanctified. Hence it follows that
   destruction hangs over the wicked, that their obstinacy and rebellion
   may be subdued, for God cannot deny himself.

   17. And the lambs shall feed after their manner. Some render it
   according to their measure, or, in proportion to their capacity, but it
   means in the usual manner. There are various ways of explaining this
   verse; but we ought first of all to observe that the Prophet intended
   to bring consolation to the godly, who trembled at hearing the dreadful
   judgments of God; for the more powerfully a man is under the influence
   of religion, the more does he feel the presence of the hand of God, and
   the more is he impressed by the apprehension of his judgment. In short,
   fear and reverence for God cause us to be deeply moved by everything
   that is presented to us in his name.

   Accordingly, after having heard such dreadful threatenings, they must
   have fainted, if this consolation had not been added as a seasoning, to
   give them a taste of the mercy of God. It is customary with the
   prophets always to pay attention to the godly, and to support their
   minds. "Although, therefore," says Isaiah, "it may seem as if God were
   about to destroy the whole nation, still he will show himself to be a
   faithful shepherd to his lambs, and will feed them in his usual
   manner."

   This is one object; but it was also the intention of the Prophet to
   repress the haughtiness of the nobles, who oppressed with unjust
   tyranny the godly and poor, and yet boasted that they were the Church
   of God. He reminds them, therefore, that it is an idle and false
   boasting, when they assume the designation of God's flock; for they are
   goats, not lambs. Not only will God have it in his power to feed his
   flock, when the goats have been cut off, but it will never fare well
   with the lambs till they have been separated from the goats.

   And the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat. There is a
   still greater diversity here among commentators; but I consider the
   true meaning to be, that the children of God, banished and treated as
   foreigners for a time, will regain their lost rights, and will then
   obtain those places which have been laid waste, or reduced to
   desolation by the fat ones, that is, by the proud and cruel men who had
   seized their property. For he calls the children of God strangers who
   would be exiles for a time, and by waste places, or forsaken places, he
   means those possessions which they had relinquished, and which others
   had seized. He refers to a custom well known and exceedingly common,
   which is, that if any one possess fields or houses, he keeps his hand,
   as it were, stretched over them, so that no one will venture to touch a
   clod; but if he forsake them they are seized. The people, therefore,
   had forsaken the possessions from which they had been expelled, so far
   as to despair of being ever able to regain them; so that they might
   justly be called forsaken places, with respect to themselves, and
   forsaken places of the fat ones, because they had been possessed by the
   mighty and powerful. We may, indeed, view the expression more simply as
   denoting forsaken fat places, but it is more probable that by the fat
   ones are meant tyrants.

   18. Wo unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity! After having
   inserted a short consolation for the purpose of allaying the bitterness
   of punishments as regards the godly, he returns to threatenings, and
   proceeds to launch those thunderbolts of words which are fitted to
   awaken some degree of alarm. By cords he means nothing else than the
   allurements by which men suffer themselves to be deceived, and harden
   their heart in crimes; for either they ridicule the judgment of God, or
   they contrive vain excuses, and allege the plea of necessity. Any
   concealment, therefore, which they employ, he calls cords; for whenever
   men are prompted to sin by the lust of the flesh, they at first pause,
   and feel that something within restrains them, which would certainly
   keep them back, if they did not rush forward with opposing violence,
   and break through all opposition. When any man is tempted to do what is
   sinful, his conscience secretly asks him, What are you doing? And sin
   never advances so freely as not to feel this check; for God intended in
   this manner to provide for the good of mankind, lest all should break
   out into unbridled licentiousness.

   How comes it, then, that men are so obstinate in doing what is sinful?
   Assuredly they permit themselves to be deceived by allurements, and
   stupify their minds, that they may despise the judgment of God, and may
   thus have some freedom to commit sin. They flatter themselves by
   imagining that what is sin is not sin, or by some excuse or idle
   pretense they lessen its enormity. These, then, are cords, wicked
   ropes, by which they draw iniquity. Hence it is evident that the Lord
   has good reason for threatening them; for they sin, not only of their
   own accord, but perversely and obstinately, and, in short, they bind
   themselves to sin, so that they are without excuse.

   19. Who say, Let him make speed. He specifies one class of sins, by
   means of which he shows that they draw sins as by ropes. When men not
   only lay aside all thought of the Divine judgment, but despise and
   treat as fabulous all that is said about it, nothing can be worse than
   this. He intended to say that the utmost contempt is manifested when
   men, to whom the judgment of God has been declared, say that it would
   give them joy to see it, and treat it with ridicule as a silly alarm;
   which is denoted by these words full of contempt and of wicked
   confidence: Let him come, let him make speed.

   Work, is here put, by way of eminence, (kat exochen,) for judgment; for
   God appears to be doing nothing when he does not punish the crimes of
   the ungodly; but when he rises up to execute judgment, and inflicts
   punishment, his work is then seen, and becomes visible (as is commonly
   said) by action; because from the very fact we learn that the world is
   governed by his authority and power. Work, therefore, is taken
   specially for judgment; because by means of it we see that God is by no
   means unemployed, but performs his office. Now, ungodly men speak of
   him with reproach and contempt, and at this very day we have abundant
   instances of such wickedness and rebellion; and the same war which was
   formerly waged by the prophets is that which we also are called to
   maintain.

   The ungodly think that God does nothing, and cares not about the
   affairs of men; as Epicurus thought that God's highest happiness
   consisted in his being free from all occupation. Though they imagine
   that there is some God, yet they do not at all acknowledge his
   judgment; and in the meantime they bid themselves be of good cheer, and
   resolve that they will not wear themselves out by such thoughts. "Let
   these prophets and ministers cry, and bawl, and hold out terrors and
   threatenings; we will wait without any concern for what they tell us,
   and in the meantime we will enjoy our mirth." In this way the Prophet
   relates the speeches of the ungodly, by which they expressed ridicule
   and contempt of the word. Not only do they say, Let his work come, but,
   Let him hasten, Let him make speed; for when he delays, they conclude
   that everything which God does not execute as soon as he has spoken it
   is idle talk. Thus Peter represents the ungodly as saying,

   "Since the world was created, the course of nature has been uniform;
   and, therefore, after so many ages, it is idle to
   expect a day of judgment." (2 Peter 3:4.)

   In the meantime, they purposely, as it were, provoke God to exert his
   power immediately, if he has any.

   Let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come. To work
   is added counsel, as if they had said, "Why does God deliberate so
   long, or say what he intends to do? Let him rather show that what he
   has decreed is accomplished." It is a great aggravation of their crime,
   that they wickedly dared to set aside the doctrine which was well known
   to them. They were more wicked than the heathen Gentiles in this
   respect, that they despised the doctrine by which he had adopted them
   to be his peculiar people.

   That we may see it. These are proofs of infidelity; for ungodly men
   will not acknowledge God, unless they have immediate evidence of his
   presence, and they refuse to believe his words. Now, if the Holy
   Spirit, by means of this mark, holds up ungodly men to detestation, we
   ought to testify our faith and piety by the opposite sign, that is, by
   relying on the word of God, though the effect does not immediately
   appear; for it is the peculiar excellence of faith to hold us dependent
   on the mouth of God. True, we next derive confirmation from works, but
   we must not begin at them; for this is the distinction between the
   elect and the reprobate, that the elect simply rely on the word, but do
   not disregard works, while ungodly men scorn and disdain the word,
   though God speak a hundred times; and yet they continually and eagerly
   call upon him for works. And when the judgment of God is declared, they
   say, "Where is it?" They cannot endure the mention of it, unless it be
   immediately made known by action. When men are so immoderate, it
   follows that they have no faith, but rather obstinate rebelliousness,
   Which more and more withdraws and estranges man from God.

   20. Wo to them that call evil good. Though some limit this statement to
   judges, yet if it be carefully examined, we shall easily learn from the
   whole context that it is general; for, having a little before reproved
   those who cannot listen to any warnings, he now proceeds with the same
   reproof. It is evident that men of this sort have always some excuse to
   plead, and some way of imposing on themselves; and, therefore, there is
   no end to their reproachful language, when their crimes are brought to
   light. But here he particularly reproves the insolence of those who
   endeavor to overthrow all distinction between good and evil

   The preposition l (lamed), prefixed to the words good and evil, is
   equivalent to Of; and therefore the meaning is, They who say of evil,
   It is good, and of good, It is evil; that is, they who by vain
   hypocrisy conceal, excuse, and disguise wicked actions, as if they
   would change the nature of everything by their sophistical arguments,
   but who, on the contrary deface good actions by their calumnies. These
   things are almost always joined together, for every one in whom the
   fear of God dwells is restrained both by conscience and by modesty from
   venturing to apologize for his sins, or to condemn what is good and
   right; but they who have not this fear do not hesitate with the same
   impudence to commend what is bad and to condemn what is good; which is
   a proof of desperate wickedness.

   This statement may be applied to various cases; for if a wo is here
   pronounced even on private individuals, when they say of evil that it
   is good, and of good that it is evil, how much more on those who have
   been raised to any elevated rank, and discharge a public office, whose
   duty it is to defend what is right and honorable! But he addresses a
   general reproof to all who flatter themselves in what is evil, and who,
   through the hatred which they bear to virtue, condemn what is done
   aright; and not only so, but who, by the subterfuges which they employ
   for the sake of concealing their own enormities, harden themselves in
   wickedness. Such persons, the Prophet tells us, act as if they would
   change light into darkness, and sweet into bitter; by which he means
   that their folly is monstrous, for it would tend to confound and
   destroy all the principles of nature.

   21. Wo to them that are wise in their own eyes! Here he proceeds to
   rebuke those on whom no instruction can produce a good effect, and who
   do not allow any wise counsels or godly warnings to gain admission. In
   short, he pronounces a curse on obstinate scorners, who set up either
   the lusts of the flesh or a preposterous confidence in their wisdom, in
   opposition to God's instruction and warnings. And not only does he
   rebuke those who are puffed up with a false conviction of their wisdom,
   and are ashamed to learn from others, but he likewise pronounces a
   general condemnation on all who, through prejudices in their own favor,
   refuse to hear God speaking, and to listen to his holy warnings.

   This fault has been too common in all ages, and we see it in very many
   persons at the present day, who, though they would shrink from openly
   rejecting the doctrine of godliness, are yet so far from being truly
   obedient and teachable, that they haughtily reject everything that does
   not please them. They acknowledge that they need some bridle, but, on
   the other hand, are so much blinded by their presumption, that, when
   God points out the way, they immediately rebel; and not only so, but
   break out into violent indignation at the censure passed on their
   proceedings. Nay, where is the man who renounces his own judgment, and
   is ready to learn only from the mouth of God? But nothing is more
   destructive than this deceitful show of wisdom; for the beginning of
   piety is willingness to be taught, when we have renounced our own
   judgment and follow wherever God calls.

   Nor is this false belief condemned solely on the ground of its
   rendering men disobedient to God, and thus being the cause of their
   ruin, but also on the ground of being in itself what God cannot endure.
   We must become fools if we desire to be God's disciples. But it is also
   certain that mad rebellion reigns wherever there is not found that
   modesty and humility which leads a man willingly to yield subjection,
   In their own eyes means what we say in French, a leur semblant, that
   is, in their own conceit

   22. Wo to them that are mighty to drink wine! Isaiah now censures
   another vice, namely, drunkenness and excess in eating, of which he had
   spoken before; so that probably this chapter is collected from various
   sermons, and the leading topics only are briefly touched; for when the
   Prophet saw no repentance, he was forced to repeat and frequently
   inculcate the same instructions. He therefore returns to the same
   reproofs which he had previously noticed; for he again discourses about
   drunkenness, luxury, covetousness, and other corruptions. Hence we
   ought to conclude, that when warnings produce no good effect, we ought
   to employ greater earnestness in addressing the obstinate and
   disobedient, and that we must not be afraid of giving offense by our
   eagerness, but must frequently repeat the reproofs, until they either
   yield or manifest incurable malice.

   By calling them strong or powerful to drink, he wittily accuses them of
   wasting their strength in bacchanalian warfare. It is disgraceful and
   beastly ambition, when a man of vigorous health makes a display of his
   strength by drinking largely. Employing a figure of speech (synecdoche)
   which is frequent in the Prophets, and indeed in the whole of
   Scripture, he takes a part for the whole; as if he had said, "Wo to
   gluttony; Wo to intemperance." But he purposely mentioned that which
   was disgraceful in the highest degree, in order to render that vice
   generally hated and abhorred; for, as we have said, nothing is more
   base or disgraceful than for a man to make trial of his strength in
   swallowing food or in guzzling wine, and thus struggling with himself
   so as to cram down as much as his belly can hold. Such men keep by no
   rule of life, and do not know why God gives them nourishment; for we
   eat and drink to support the body, and not to destroy it. We live that
   we may yield worship and obedience to God, and that we may render
   assistance to our neighbors. When men act so as not to maintain their
   strength, but to destroy it by trying how much food and wine they can
   bear, most certainly they are worse than beasts.

   23. Who justify the wicked for a reward. He censures a corruption which
   at that time abounded in judgment-seats, and points out the reason why
   there is no room for justice in these places, namely, that they are
   under the influence of gifts. For covetousness blindeth the eyes of the
   wise, and perverteth all regard to what is good and just, even among
   those who would otherwise be disposed to follow what is right. (Exodus
   23:8; Deuteronomy 16:19.)

   It may be objected that there are other methods, and that it is not by
   gifts only that judgments are perverted; for favor, hatred, friendship,
   and other sinful passions, often blind the understanding. This is
   undoubtedly true; but the Prophet had in his eye what happens for the
   most part, (epi to polu,) and at the same time did not intend to spare
   those vices which he did not express by name. Following this example,
   godly teachers ought to be wise and careful in observing and correcting
   the vices which most extensively abound among the people, and most of
   all to oppose everything which appears to be sanctioned by wicked
   custom.

   Now this corruption which is mentioned is that which most frequently of
   all is to be found in judgment-seats; and, therefore, it ought to be
   most carefully avoided by those judges who wish to form an upright
   judgment. Nor ought we to listen to what is affirmed by many, that
   gifts are not bestowed on them for that purpose, or that, after having
   accepted them, they are as free as ever to give a just decision; for
   where gifts are allowed, the regard to what is just and right must be
   corrupted, and it is impossible for your mind not to be favourably
   disposed towards him from whom you received them. In short, we should
   hear the Lord, who declares that the understanding of the wisest man is
   corrupted, and the disposition of the most upright man is perverted,
   unless we choose to be thought wiser than God.

   24. Therefore as the flame of fire devoureth the stubble. Lest it
   should be thought that he has so frequently cried out without good
   reason, he again shows what grievous and dreadful punishment awaits the
   nation, and threatens utter destruction to the stubborn, because they
   did not permit themselves to be brought back to the right path, but
   obstinately resisted instruction. He employs metaphors exceedingly well
   adapted to express his meaning, and better fitted to affect their
   hearts than if he had spoken plainly and without a figure. He begins
   with a comparison, but immediately slides into a metaphor, attributing
   a root and branch to the nation as to a tree. Under those two words he
   includes all the strength, either hidden or visible, that belongs to
   the nation, and says that the whole will be destroyed; for when the
   root, which alone gives strength and nourishment to the tree, becomes
   rotten, it is all over with the tree; and in like manner he threatens
   that it is all over with the nation, and that its whole strength is
   wasted and consumed.

   Because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts. He does not now
   enumerate, as formerly, the particular kinds of crime by which they had
   provoked the wrath of God, but assigns a general cause, namely,
   contempt of the law of God; for this, as all men know, is the source of
   everything bad. And it is no small aggravation of their crime that,
   when the will of God had been made known to them in his law, it was not
   through ignorance or mistake, but through inveterate malice, that they
   shook of the yoke of God, and abandoned themselves to every kind of
   licentiousness; which was nothing else than to reject so kind a Father,
   and to give themselves up to be the slaves of the devil. Besides, he
   accuses them of open revolt; as if he had said that it was not in one
   or a few instances that they were rebellious, but that they might be
   regarded as treacherous apostates, and had altogether forsaken God.

   And loathed the word of the Holy One of Israel. He complains that they
   not only despised the word of God, but -- what is far more shocking --
   turned away from it, or threw it away in wicked disdain. But if
   contempt for the law of God is the source, head, and accumulation of
   all that is evil, there is nothing against which we ought more
   carefully to guard than that Satan should take away our reverence for
   it; and if there are any faults to which we are liable, we ought, at
   least, to allow a remedy to be applied to them, if we do not choose, by
   wickedly rejecting it, to draw down upon ourselves everlasting
   destruction.

   25. Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled. In this verse the
   Prophet relates the former punishments which the Jews had already
   endured, and shows that they are not near an end; but that, on the
   contrary, heavier judgments await them, if they do not return to the
   right path. I readily acknowledge that the past tense is frequently
   employed instead of the future, but the meaning which I have stated
   will best agree with the context; for there are two things quite
   distinct from each other, which he lays down, on account of the
   resolute obstinacy of the people. First, how God perceives their
   crimes. Secondly, since there are no signs of repentance, he has other
   scourges within his reach for chastising the people. Thirdly, he
   describes what those scourges are, and forewarns them that the
   Assyrians will come at the bidding of the Lord, as soon as he shall
   express it by merely hissing to them, (verse. 26.)

   Such is the connection of what the Prophet states; and hence it ought
   to be observed that the great body of men, as soon as they have escaped
   any calamity, forget their chastisements, and no longer regard them as
   the judgments of God; and that, though experience be the instructor of
   fools, still they grow hardened by strokes. This insensibility Isaiah
   sharply rebukes; as if he had said, "Have you so quickly forgotten the
   calamities under which you lately groaned? Whence came the distressful
   casting out of dead bodies, but because God had raised his arm against
   you? And if God has discharged the office of a judge, why do not those
   recent chastisements induce you to fear him, and to refrain from
   drawing down a succession of chastisements by new crimes?"

   Accordingly, he repeats the term l-kn, (gnal ken,) therefore; as if he
   had said that those distresses are not accidental, but are manifest
   tokens of God's vengeance; and so he expressly says that God was angry
   with his people; for if the Jews had not fallen from their own rank,
   their condition would have been happier than that of any other nation.
   When God's chosen people, therefore, are treated by him with so much
   sharpness and severity, it is beyond all doubt that he has been
   provoked by heinous crimes. At the same time he refutes the false
   boasting by which the Jews were wont to vaunt and exalt themselves, as
   if they ought to be exempt from chastisements on the ground of their
   being God's peculiar people.

   And the mountains trembled. By this comparison the dreadful nature of
   those punishments to which they were insensible is described in such a
   manner as to prove more clearly the stupidity of the people. They were
   more stupid than inanimate objects, if they did not perceive the wrath
   of God, and the dreadful vengeance which had been inflicted on the
   kingdom of Israel.

   For all these things. He threatens heavier chastisements in future, as
   we have already said; for although wicked men acknowledge that the Lord
   has punished them, still they think that they have no right to expect
   anything more than one or two chastisements. As if therefore nothing
   worse could befall them, and as if God's power to punish them had been
   exhausted, they wrap themselves up in blind indifference. This is the
   reason why he exclaims that the wrath of God is not yet appeased, and
   that, although it has inflicted on them many calamities, still it has
   within its stores many weapons from which they have reason to dread
   innumerable wounds.

   The copulative v (vau) may be taken as a disjunctive, so as to mean,
   but, on the contrary, his hand is stretched out still. He refers to
   what he had formerly said, that the hand of God is stretched out. He
   tells them that it is not yet drawn back, and that it may yet pursue
   them, and inflict plagues of the same kind, or even of greater
   severity. We ought diligently to meditate on these statements, in order
   to shake off that drowsiness to which the greater part of men are
   frequently liable, even after having received chastisements.

   26. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations. In this and the
   following verses he describes the nature of the punishment which the
   Lord would inflict on his people; namely, that they were about to
   suffer from the Assyrians a similar, or even a heavier calamity, than
   that which their brethren the Israelites had lately endured. Many
   distresses had indeed been suffered by themselves from the Assyrians,
   though the kingdom of Judah was not yet overturned. Besides, what had
   befallen the kingdom of Israel might be viewed as a mirror in which
   they could behold God's wrath and righteous chastisement.

   And yet this prediction, though it was accompanied by clear proofs,
   must undoubtedly have appeared to be incredible; for at that time they
   enjoyed repose, and the slightest truce of any kind easily laid them
   asleep. He says, therefore, that this calamity will come to them from
   distant nations, from whom nothing of this kind was expected; and he
   sounds an alarm as if the enemy were already at hand. It is not for the
   sake of soothing their fear that he uses those words, from afar, and
   from the end of the earth; but, on the contrary, he speaks in this
   manner for the express purpose of informing them that they ought not to
   judge of the anger of God from what meets the eye, for we are wont to
   judge of dangers from the outward appearance of things. Now, if the
   enemies are not so near, or if other circumstances hinder them from
   giving us immediate annoyance, we give ourselves no concern. Thus the
   people were lulled into a profound sleep, as if there were no danger to
   be dreaded. But Isaiah says that this will not hinder the Lord from
   erecting a banner, and instantly commissioning the Assyrians to
   slaughter them. The expression is metaphorical; for when a banner is
   displayed it is customary for soldiers, at the bidding of their
   general, to advance in hostile array and rush into the battle.

   He will hiss to it. [88] Though a change of number frequently occurs in
   Scripture, yet it is on solid grounds that the Prophet, by changing the
   number, makes many nations to be but one nation. The meaning is, that
   when it shall please God to assemble various nations, and form them
   into one body, it will not be a confused multitude, but will resemble a
   body which has a visible head that rules and guides. He chose to employ
   the word hiss rather than a word of weightier import, such as sound a
   trumpet, or anything of that sort; in order to show that God does not
   need to sound a trumpet in order to call the enemies to battle, and
   that he has no difficulty in inflicting punishment when the time for
   taking vengeance is fully at hand, for by a mere nod he can accomplish
   the whole. [89]

   And lo, it will come speedy and swift. This confirms still more what I
   have already observed, that we ought not to judge of the anger of the
   Lord from the present appearance of things; for although everything
   appears to give assurances of peace, yet suddenly war will break out
   from a quarter from which we do not expect it. Even though we think
   that we are defended on all sides by friends, yet God will stir up
   enemies from the farthest corners of the earth, who will break through
   every obstruction, and overtake us with ease, as if the way were plain
   and smooth. This ought to be carefully observed, that we may not suffer
   ourselves to be blinded by vain presumption and foolish confidence.

   We ought also to observe that wars are not kindled accidentally, or by
   an arrangement of men, but by the command of God, as if he assembled
   the soldiers by the sound of a trumpet. Whether, therefore, we are
   afflicted by battle, or by famine, or by pestilence, let us know that
   all this comes from the hand of God, for all things obey him and follow
   his direction. And yet it was not the intention of the Chaldeans to
   obey God, for they were hurried on by their eagerness to obtain wealth
   and power, while he has quite another object in view: but God employs
   their agency for executing his judgments. Hence arises a remarkable and
   illustrious display of the power of God, which is not limited by the
   will of men, or dependent on their decisions, but leads them, though
   contrary to their wish, or without their knowledge, to obey him. And
   yet it is no excuse for the ungodly that they are drawn contrary to the
   disposition of their mind, and do not willingly serve God, for they aim
   at nothing else than fraud, cruelty, and violence; and by their cruelty
   God punishes the transgressions and crimes of his people.

   27. None shall be weary, nor stumble among them. The meaning is, that
   everything will be prepared and arranged in such a manner that there
   shall be no delay or obstruction to their march; as if a prince, having
   recruited the ranks of his soldiers, immediately gave orders that the
   roads should be cleared, provisions obtained, and everything necessary
   provided. He therefore shows that they will be fleet and swift, and
   that there will be nothing to hinder their rapid march.

   None shall slumber nor sleep. He expresses their vast activity by
   saying that they will not be drowsy. In these words, they shall not
   slumber nor sleep, the natural order is inverted, He ought rather to
   have said, They shall not sleep nor slumber; for it is a smaller matter
   to slumber than to sleep. But that phrase ought to be explained in this
   manner: They shall not slumber nor even sleep; that is, they will be so
   far from sleeping, that they will not even slumber. You have an
   instance of this in these words:

   Lo, he that keepeth Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
   (Psalm 121:4.)

   It is a Hebrew phrase, with which neither the Greek nor the Latin idiom
   agrees.

   28. Their arrows will be sharp. He means that they will be provided
   with necessary weapons. The custom alluded to is that which existed
   among the Assyrians and other eastern nations, who frequently made use
   of bows and arrows in battle, as Englishmen of the present day enter
   into the battlefield with a loaded quiver. [90] Under this class he
   includes every kind of weapons of war. But as the way was long, and the
   journey difficult, the Jew might think that many things would occur to
   interrupt the march of the enemy. He therefore says, that the hoofs of
   the horses will be like flint; by which he means that they will suffer
   no molestation, and will at length arrive in Judea without weariness.
   For a similar reason he compares their wheels to a whirlwind. The
   ancients were wont to employ chariots in going to war, and therefore he
   mentions not only horses, but wheels. All these circumstances must be
   understood to relate to the haste and rapidity with which they would
   proceed; or, in other words, that no length of journey would prevent
   the Lord from carrying forward the enemies without delay for the
   destruction of the Jews.

   29. His roaring shall be like that of a lion. This denotes fierceness
   and cruelty, for he compares the Chaldeans to lions, which, we know,
   are frightful to behold, and savage by nature; as if he had said that
   they would not be men who were moved by any feeling of compassion or
   tenderness, but rather that they would be savage beasts. He adds, that
   they will likewise possess great strength, so that none will venture to
   approach for rescuing their prey. He means that the Jews will have no
   defense for warding off their attacks, because the dread of their
   cruelty will keep all at a distance from them. It was God who employed
   their agency in punishing the Jews, and therefore it was necessary that
   they should be armed with formidable power, that this wayward people
   might at length acknowledge that they had to do not with men but with

   God, into whose hands it is a fearful thing to fall.
   (Hebrews 10:31.)

   30. He shall roar against him. [91] The Prophet adds this, that the
   Jews may understand that the fierce attack of the Chaldeans is not
   accidental, but that they have been appointed by God and are guided by
   his hand. By the roaring of the sea he means an attack so violent that
   it will look like a deluge, by which the whole of Judea will suffer
   shipwreck. He likewise cuts off all hope by foretelling that the
   punishment will have no alleviation and no end. "The Jews," he says,
   "will do what is usually done in a season of perplexity, will cast
   their eyes up and down to discover the means of escape; but in whatever
   direction they look, whether to heaven or to earth, they will find no
   relief whatever; for on all sides distresses and calamities will
   overwhelm them." This mode of expression has come to be frequently
   employed even by the common people, when misery and ruin appear on all
   sides, and no escape or relief can be found. This must unavoidably
   happen when the Lord pursues us, so that his uplifted arm meets our
   eyes on every side, and, wherever we turn, we behold his creatures
   armed against us to execute his judgments; for we may sometimes escape
   the hand of men, but how can we escape the hand of God?

   CHAPTER 6.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah Chapter 6:1-13

   1. In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
   throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.

   1. Anno mortis regis Usiae, vidi Dominum sedentem super solium excelsum
   et elevatum, cujus extrema replebant templum.

   2. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he
   covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he
   did fly.

   2. Et seraphim stabant super ipsum: erant singulis sex alae; duabus
   operiebant faciem suam; duabus tegebant pedes suos; et duabus volabant.

   3. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
   of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

   3. Et clamabant alter alteri, dicentes, Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus,
   Iehova exercituum; plena est omnis terra gloriae ejus.

   4. And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and
   the house was filled with smoke.

   4. Et commota sunt superliminaria postium a voce clamantis; et domus
   impleta est fumo.

   5. Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
   unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for
   mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.

   5. Tunc dixi, Vae mihi, quia excisus sum (vel in silentium redactus);
   cum homo sim pollutis labiis, et in medio populi habitem polluta labia
   habentis; et tamen regem Iehovam exercituum viderunt oculi mei.

   6. Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his
   hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the alter:

   6. Volavit autem ad me unus ex seraphim; habens in manu sua carbonem
   ardentem, forcipe correptum ab altari.

   7. And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy
   lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.

   7. Et applicans super os meum, dixit, Ecce, tetigit hoc labia tua, et
   expiabitur peccatum tuum.

   8. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and
   who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

   8. Postea audivi vocem Domini dicentis, Quem mittam? et quis ibit
   nobis? Tum dixi, Ecce ego, mitte me.

   9. And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
   understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

   9. Tum dixit, Vade, et dic populo isti; audiendo audite, et ne
   intelligatis; videndo videto, et nesciatis;

   10. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and
   shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their
   ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.

   10. Obstina cor populi hujus, et aures ejus aggrava, et oculos ejus
   obline; ne forte videat oculis suis, et auribus suis audiat, et cor
   ejus intelligat, et ubi conversus fuerit, sit illi sanatio.

   11. Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be
   wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be
   utterly desolate,

   11. Et dixi, Usque quo, Domine? et ait, Dum fuerint vastatae civitates
   absque habitatore, et domus vacuatae fuerint hominibus, et terra
   redacta fuerit in solitudinem;

   12. And the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great
   forsaking in the midst of the land.

   12. Donec procul amoverit Deus homines, sitque multa vastitas in medio
   terrae;

   13. But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be
   eaten: as a teil-tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when
   they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the substance
   thereof.

   13. Donec in ea decima, et revertetur; et erit in excidium sicut tilia
   et quercus, quibus in projectione est subsistentia; ita in hac erit
   subsistentia, semen sanctum.


   1. In the year that king Uzziah died. This is usually the beginning of
   the sixth chapter; but some think that it is the beginning of the book
   itself, and that in collecting the prophecies of Isaiah an error was
   committed. The reason which they assign is, that the Prophet here
   declines the office of a teacher, which he would not have refused if he
   had hitherto discharged it; that he appears to be a mere novice as yet
   unacquainted with his calling; and besides, that he declares that he
   has now seen the Lord, and that he has not seen him, before. But such
   arguments I consider, as I have already noticed, to be too feeble and
   unsatisfactory; and I reply that it ought not to be thought strange
   that he was so completely overpowered by this extraordinary vision as
   to forget that he was a prophet. For there was no feeling in him which
   was not overpowered by the presence of God, so that, like one who had
   lost his senses, he willingly plunged himself in darkness, or rather,
   like one who despaired of life, he of his own accord chose to die. And
   it is necessary that the godly should be affected in this manner, when
   the Lord gives them tokens of his presence, that they may be brought
   low and utterly confounded. Besides, in the person of his servant God
   intended to strike his rebellious people with alarm; and therefore we
   need not wonder if he offers an apology for himself under the
   overwhelming influence of fear, and likewise because he had not felt
   the weight of his office, as he now felt it, after having beheld an
   illustrious display of the majesty of God.

   But why was not this vision exhibited to him at the beginning? I
   answer, it was necessary in regard to the time, that he might be more
   and more confirmed in the discharge of his office. We have an instance
   of this in the Apostles themselves; for at first they were sent out
   with an injunction not to pass beyond the limits of Judea, (Matthew
   10:5;) but after that Christ had risen, he again set them apart in a
   new and solemn manner, breathed on them, bidding them receive the Holy
   Ghost, (John 20:21,22;) and not only so, but sending his Spirit from
   heaven in the forms of tongues of fire, invested them with
   extraordinary power. (Acts 2:3.) Thus, on account of the various
   changes of times and of kings, it was necessary that Isaiah should be
   encouraged and again attested by a new vision; that he might be excited
   to perseverance, and might afterwards proceed with greater cheerfulness
   in his course; and also that the Jews might perceive his ministry to be
   supported by heavenly authority.

   This appears to me to be a sufficient reason why this vision was not
   exhibited to him at the very beginning, but after that he had for some
   time discharged the office of a teacher. That this was not the
   beginning of the prophecy is evident enough from the consideration that
   the preface, which we have already examined, is much better adapted for
   the commencement, and more appropriate than what is contained in this
   chapter; and every approach having been shut up by the hard-hearted
   obstinacy of the people, it was proper that he should burst forth in
   this vehement manner. Besides, it is probable that he had long
   performed the office of a teacher under King Uzziah, who, I think, was
   dead before this prediction was published. In short, the Prophet means
   that it was not till he had commenced his course that God appeared to
   him.

   Some think that death here means leprosy, which undoubtedly was a civil
   death, when the king was compelled to withdraw from the society of men,
   and to lay down the reins of government, (2 Kings 15:5;) but I choose
   rather to take death in its literal sense. So then, I think that Isaiah
   uttered the former predictions during the reign of Uzziah, even after
   he had been struck with leprosy; and that when he had died, and Jotham
   had succeeded him, this vision was presented to Isaiah. We know what
   various commotions are produced by a change of kings, so that we need
   not wonder that Isaiah had his calling again sealed. But the prophecy
   itself, which follows, will sufficiently show that he had been a public
   teacher for some time before he saw the Lord; for it relates that the
   blinding of the people, whose obstinacy he had experienced to such an
   extent that he might have been induced to cease from his undertaking,
   for he saw that he was doing no good. The Lord, therefore, confirms him
   by this vision, that the opposition may not prevent him from boldly
   discharging his office, and performing what he undertook at the
   commandment of God.

   I saw the Lord It is asked, How could Isaiah see God who is a Spirit,
   (John 4:24,) and, therefore, cannot be seen with bodily eyes? Nay,
   more, since the understandings of men cannot rise to his boundless
   height, how can he be seen in a visible shape? But we ought to be aware
   that, when God exhibited himself to the view of the Fathers, he never
   appeared such as he actually is, but such as the capacity of men could
   receive. Though men may be said to creep on the ground, or at least
   dwell far below the heavens, there is no absurdity in supposing that
   God comes down to them in such a manner as to cause some kind of mirror
   to reflect the rays of his glory. There was, therefore, exhibited to
   Isaiah such a form as enabled him, according to his capacity, to
   perceive the inconceivable majesty of God; and thus he attributes to
   God a throne, a robe, and a bodily appearance.

   Hence we learn a profitable doctrine, that whenever God grants any
   token of his presence, he is undoubtedly present with us, for he does
   not amuse us by unmeaning shapes, as men wickedly disfigure him by
   their contrivances. since, therefore, that exhibition was no deceitful
   representation of the presence of God, Isaiah justly declares that he
   saw him. In like manner, when it is said that John

   saw the Holy Spirit in the shape of a dove, (John 1:32)

   the name of the Holy Spirit is applied to the outward sign, because in
   the representation there was no deception; and yet he did not see the
   essence of the Spirit, but had a clear and undoubted proof, so that he
   could not doubt that the Spirit of God rested on Christ.

   Secondly, it is asked, Who was that Lord? John tells us that it was
   Christ, (John 12:41,) and justly, for God never revealed himself to the
   Fathers but in his eternal Word and only begotten Son. Yet it is wrong,
   I think, to limit this, as some do, to the person of Christ; for it is
   indefinitely, on the contrary, that the Prophet calls him God. Nor do
   their views derive any support from the word 'dvny, (adonai,) which
   seems particularly to apply to Christ; for it is often applied to God
   in an absolute and unrestricted manner. In this passage, therefore, God
   is mentioned indefinitely, and yet it is correctly said that Isaiah saw
   the glory of Christ, for at that very time he was the image of the
   invisible God. (Colossians 1:15.)

   Sitting upon a throne. He could not have given a better description of
   God, in regard to place, than in the person of a Judge, that his
   majesty might strike greater terror into the Jews; for we shall
   afterwards see the dreadful judgment which the Lord pronounced from his
   judgment-seat. But lest we should suppose that the Prophet contrived
   the manner in which he would paint God, we ought to know that he
   faithfully describes the very form in which God was represented and
   exhibited to him. It may be questioned whether the Prophet was
   conducted into the temple, or saw this vision while he was asleep.
   Though many things are frequently adduced on both sides, which are
   fitted to leave the matter in doubt, yet it may be conjectured with
   some probability, that even if he had not been within the temple, this
   vision might have been presented to him, either in his own house or on
   a field, in the same manner as to other prophets.

   And his remotest parts filled the temple. [92] Almost all the
   commentators understand by this the fringes of his robe, though it may
   be understood to refer to the extremities of the judgment-seat, giving
   us to understand that its dimensions were so vast as to extend to every
   part of the temple. He intends to ascribe to God a venerable aspect,
   and far beyond any human form. There is great weight in the
   circumstance that he appeared in the temple; for he had promised that
   he would meet with his people there, and the people expected his
   answers from that place, as Solomon had expressly stated at the
   dedication of it. (1 Kings 8:30.) In order, therefore, that the people
   might understand that those things came from God, on whom they called
   every day, and on whom they relied with a vain confidence which puffed
   them up, this vision was exhibited to the Prophet in the temple. To the
   certainty of what was said it contributed not a little, that he openly
   proclaimed that the discourse was not pronounced to him by any mortal
   man, but was a heavenly oracle, uttered by that God whose name they
   were accustomed disdainfully to hold out as a pretense, whenever they
   wished to make any extravagant claims; for otherwise this prophecy
   would have been harsh and repulsive, and needed great confirmation. It
   was also not uncommon with the Prophets to say that the Lord spake to
   them from his temple, or from his sanctuary

   2. And the seraphim stood upon it. Having declared that God appeared to
   him full of majesty and of glory, he adds, that God was attended by
   angels, whom the Prophet calls seraphim on account of their fervor.
   Though the etymology of this word is well known, yet various reasons
   are adduced. Some think that they are called seraphim because they burn
   with the love of God; others, because they are swift like fire; others,
   because they are bright. However that may be, this description holds
   out to us, as in sunbeams, the brightness of God's infinite majesty,
   that we may learn by it to behold and adore his wonderful and
   overwhelming glory.

   Many think that there were two seraphim, as there were two cherubim
   that encompassed the ark of the testimony. This opinion I willingly
   adopt, though I do not venture to make any assertion where Scripture is
   silent. As it is customary with the sacred writers to accommodate their
   descriptions of God to those outward signs which were commonly used and
   familiarly known among the godly, it is possible that the Prophet saw a
   representation of this kind. While I hold this to be a probable
   conjecture, I leave room for other interpretations which some may be
   disposed to prefer; for Daniel saw not two angels only, but thousands
   of thousands of angels. (Daniel 7:10.)

   Each one had six wings. This representation is instructive; for those
   wings thus arranged contained some mystery which it was the will of the
   Lord should not remain wholly unknown. The two wings with which the
   angels fly mean nothing else than their ready and cheerful performance
   of the commandments of God. On this point the resemblance is so clear
   and manifest, that it will be at once admitted by all who do not take
   delight in controversy. The two wings with which they cover their face
   show plainly enough that even angels cannot endure God's brightness,
   and that they are dazzled by it in the same manner as when we attempt
   to gaze upon the radiance of the sun. And if angels are overwhelmed by
   the majesty of God, how great will be the rashness of men if they
   venture to intrude so far! Let us, therefore, learn that our inquiries
   concerning God ought never to go beyond what is proper and lawful, that
   our knowledge may soberly and modestly taste what is far above our
   capacity. And yet the angels do not cover their face in such a manner
   as not to be favored with beholding God in some degree; for their
   flight is not at random. In like manner we too ought to look at God,
   but only so far as our capacity shall enable us.

   As to the remaining two wings, which were placed lower, the difficulty
   is somewhat greater. Some think that the angels covered their feet,
   that they might not touch the earth, and contract any defilement from
   it, as human beings like ourselves are wont to do; for in walking we
   gather filth and dust, and accordingly, so long as we dwell on earth,
   we are always tainted by some kind of contagion. This reminds believers
   that they will have no intercourse with angels till they raise
   themselves high, and are no longer fastened to the earth.

   Such is the interpretation given by some expositors. But I rather agree
   with those who think that the use of those wings was opposite to that
   of the upper wings; for, as by the upper wings they cover their face,
   that they may not be overpowered by God's brightness, so they have also
   lower wings to conceal them from our view. Now, if it be true that we
   cannot behold the small and feeble rays of the Divine brightness
   without being altogether overpowered, how could we gaze upon that
   unspeakably bright and glorious majesty which lays prostrate all our
   faculties? Let men learn, therefore, that they are far distant from a
   perfect knowledge of God, since they cannot even reach to the angels.
   The latter appears to me to be the more correct exposition, but I do
   not disapprove of the former.

   3. And they cried one to another. It was necessary that all these
   things should be presented to the Prophet in vision, in order to
   produce a stronger impression on the people, and on Isaiah himself; for
   the vision was not less necessary to him than to the whole nation,
   because sharp and painful struggles awaited him, and he could not have
   boldly announced those events if he had not been previously confirmed.
   The people also, being warned by this vision how great and how dreadful
   was the majesty of God, by whom this condemnation was pronounced, had
   good reason for being alarmed. He who now came forth to public view is
   God, at the sight of whom the very angels tremble, whose praises they
   continually and loudly utter, and whom, in a word, they serve and obey;
   but men, whom he had been pleased to adopt as his children, obstinately
   and rebelliously opposed him.

   Now, when we are informed that the angels are employed in uttering the
   glory of God, let us know that their example is set before us for
   imitation; for the most holy service that we can render to him is, to
   be employed in praising his name. When he associates us with angels, it
   is in order that, while we sojourn on earth, we may resemble and be
   joined to the inhabitants of heaven. That the harmony between us and
   the angels may be in every respect complete, we must take care not only
   that the praises of God may be sounded by our tongues, but likewise
   that all the actions of our life may correspond to our professions; and
   this will only be done if the chief aim of our actions be the glory of
   God.

   Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts. The ancients quoted this passage
   when they wished to prove that there are three persons in one essence
   of the Godhead. I do not disagree with their opinion; but if I had to
   contend with heretics, I would rather choose to employ stronger proofs;
   for they become more obstinate, and assume an air of triumph, when
   inconclusive arguments are brought against them; and they might easily
   and readily maintain that, in this passage, as in other parts of
   Scripture, the number "three" denotes perfection. Although, therefore,
   I have no doubt that the angels here describe One God in Three Persons,
   (and, indeed, it is impossible to praise God without also uttering the
   praises of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit,) yet I think that
   it would be better to employ more conclusive passages, lest, in proving
   an article of our faith, we should expose ourselves to the scorn of
   heretics. And, indeed, this repetition rather points out unwearied
   perseverance, as if the Prophet had said, that the angels never cease
   from their melody in singing the praises of God, as the holiness of God
   supplies us with inexhaustible reasons for them.

   The whole earth is full of his glory. Literally it is, the fullness of
   the whole earth, which might be understood to refer to the fruits, and
   animals, and manifold riches with which God has enriched the earth, and
   might convey this meaning, that in the ornaments and great variety of
   furniture of the world the glory of God shines, because they are so
   many proofs of a father's love. But the more simple and natural
   interpretation is, that the glory of God fills the whole world, or is
   spread through every region of the earth. There is also, I think, an
   implied contrast, by which he puts down the foolish boasting of the
   Jews, who thought that the glory of God was nowhere to be seen but
   among themselves, and wished to have it shut up within their own
   temple. But Isaiah shows that it is so far from being confined to so
   narrow limits, that it fills the whole earth. And to this agrees the
   prophecy which immediately follows, (verse 10,) about the blinding of
   the Jews, which opened up for the Gentiles admission into the Church of
   God; for they occupied that place which the Jews had forsaken and left
   empty.

   4. And the lintels of the posts were moved. This noise was an
   indication that it was not a human voice which the Prophet had heard;
   for no mortal man has a voice so powerful as to be capable of making
   the lintels and posts shake. Now, the Lord intended not only to
   establish the authority of his voice over the Prophet, but to confirm
   it to posterity in all ages, that it might never be forgotten. Let us,
   therefore, know that this noise confirms at this day the voice of God,
   that we may tremble whenever he speaks; for if inanimate and dumb
   creatures are moved, what ought we to do, who feel, smell, taste, and
   understand, for no other purpose than that we may obey his word in a
   holy and reverent manner?

   And the house was filled with smoke. This was the common and ordinary
   sign which the Lord employed with his ancient people; for we read that,
   whenever Moses entered into the tabernacle, smoke was wont to be
   diffused through it in such a manner that the people could not see
   either Moses or the tabernacle. (Exodus 33:9.) The smoke, therefore,
   which Isaiah describes was not an unusual occurrence; but in the
   ordinary way God intended to demonstrate that he would display his
   power in executing judgment on the people.

   But it may be asked, Why did God manifest his presence by this sign
   rather than by any other? This question may be answered in two ways.
   First, it was always the will of God to repress the insolence of men,
   in pushing their inquiries about his majesty beyond what is proper; for
   on this point almost all men are too rash and daring. They wish to rise
   above the clouds, and to penetrate into the secrets of God, while they
   do not see what lies at their feet. Hence arises a labyrinth of errors,
   and when the minds of men have been entangled in it, they adopt false
   and pretended modes of worship; for when men allow themselves to adopt
   any false notions about God, there is nothing which they will not
   venture to attempt against him. It was not without good reason,
   therefore, that he made use of smoke, in order to remind men of their
   weakness; and yet he did not intend that they should be blind or
   stupid, that is, that they should have the stupidity and error which
   the papists disguise under the name of simplicity; but he forbids us to
   inquire or search beyond what he has revealed to us in his word; for,
   as Augustine says, "that is a learned ignorance." Whenever, therefore,
   smoke of this kind is mentioned, let us know that it lays a restraint
   upon us from indulging curiosity in our researches into the purpose of
   God.

   Secondly, this smoke ought to strike terror, as David, when describing
   an angry and terrible God, says that clouds and darkness are round
   about him. (Psalm 97:2.) This also agrees well with the present
   passage; for he pronounces a dreadful judgment, namely, the blinding of
   the Jews. Others think that it indicated the burning by which he
   consumed the temple; but the view which I have given is more probable.

   5. Wo to me! for I am undone. The Prophet now relates how powerfully he
   was affected by that vision; namely that he was so terrified by seeing
   God; that he expected immediate destruction. He assigns the reason for
   believing that it is all over with him; because, says he, I am a man of
   unclean lips

   I wonder why Jerome renders it, because I was silent; seeing that there
   is no ambiguity in the expression. dmh (damah) does indeed signify to
   be silent, but here the undoubted mark of a passive verb is added. This
   passage may likewise be rendered, Wo to me! for I have been reduced to
   silence. In the Scriptures silence is often taken for death and those
   who have been buried are said to have been reduced to silence. But as
   the meaning is the same, I will not dispute much about the translation.

   The Prophet therefore means, that he was so terrified as to resemble a
   dead man. And certainly we need not wonder at this; for the whole man,
   so far as relates to the flesh, must be reduced to nothing, that it may
   be renewed according to God. Whence comes it that men live, that is,
   imagine that they live, and are swelled with vain confidence in their
   wisdom or strength, but because they know not God? Accordingly, until
   God reveal himself to us, we do not think that we are men, or rather,
   we think that we are gods; but when we have seen God, we then begin to
   feel and know what we are. Hence springs true humility, which consists
   in this, that a man makes no claims for himself, and depends wholly on
   God; and therefore on this point the present and similar passages ought
   to be carefully studied.

   It was customary with the godly fathers, whenever they saw God, to
   break out into these words:

   I am gone; I am utterly undone. (Judges 13:22.)

   Our life, therefore, until our minds earnestly draw near to God, is a
   vain delusion; we walk in darkness, and can with difficulty distinguish
   truth from falsehood; but when we come into the light it is easy to
   perceive the difference. So when God draws near to us, he brings light
   with him, that we may perceive our worthlessness, which we could not
   formerly see, while we entertained a false opinion of ourselves.

   And yet mine eyes have seen the king, Jehovah of hosts. [93] But does
   the sight of God bring death to men? For it appears strange that the
   sight of God or approach to him should take away life, of which he is
   the source and giver. I reply that this is an accidental result; for it
   takes place through our fault, and not on account of the nature of God.
   Death is within us; but we do not perceive it, unless when it is
   compared with the life of God. This is unquestionably what the Prophet
   means; for he does not merely say that he is dead, but assigns the
   reason, because he has unclean lips.

   But why does he confine the pollution to the lips? Was he pure in
   understanding, or in the other parts of the body? I answer: the Prophet
   mentions that which he regarded as the most valuable, his tongue, which
   was consecrated to God; for God had appointed him to be a Prophet. Even
   though he was in other respects a sinner, yet because the office which
   he held was holy, this part of his body was sacred; and as it does not
   correspond to the divine holiness, he confesses that, even in that part
   which in itself is more holy, he is polluted. Such appears to me to be
   the true and natural meaning of this passage, in the explanation of
   which commentators have hitherto been unsuccessful.

   And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. This is added by
   way of explanation; for he includes himself as an individual in the
   number of the common people, tainted with that pollution which extends
   to the whole body, and forgets the purity which he had received from
   God, because it cannot dwell in his presence. Hence it is evident that
   they are mistaken who imagine that the Prophet spoke under erroneous
   views; as the common people are wont to contrive a variety of false
   notions concerning God. For, as I have said, the presence of God and
   approach to him is the destruction of our flesh; because it shows that
   we are nothing in ourselves. When he who is conscious of his
   wretchedness sees God, what can he expect but destruction? For God is
   our judge, to whom, we know, nothing is concealed or unknown, in whose
   sight our purity is impure. And if this happened to the Prophet, what
   ought we to think of ourselves? For what are we in comparison of him?
   Even if the LORD hath begun to cleanse us, yet we ought to acknowledge
   our pollution, the remains of which always continue in our flesh. Hence
   also we ought to draw a universal doctrine, that the lips of all men
   are impure and polluted, till the Lord has cleansed them; from which it
   also follows, that human doctrines have an uncleanness which betrays
   them, and that there is nothing pure but what has come from God.

   6. Then flew one of the seraphim to me. The Prophet shows what kind of
   relief was brought to him, when he was so terrified as to think that he
   was a dead man; and this confirms what we have already said, that
   purity of lips comes from God alone; for men can produce nothing of
   themselves but what is filthy and abominable. If it be objected that it
   is absurd to say that the Lord now cleansed him, as if his tongue had
   formerly been impure and profane, though it had been the instrument
   employed by the Holy Spirit, I have already replied sufficiently to
   that objection. The Lord had already cleansed him, but according to his
   degree. The cleansing which is now added is greater; for it has its
   enlargements and additions, which no man can obtain all at once.

   We must not conclude, therefore, that Isaiah's lips were impure,
   because they are now cleansed; but we ought to inquire why it is done.
   It was because the Lord intended to enlarge and extend his favor
   towards him, and to raise him to higher dignity, that he might have
   greater influence over the people; and this was rendered necessary by
   the character of the times, and the change which had taken place in the
   state.

   The fire was taken from the altar, to intimate that it was divine or
   heavenly; for the law forbade any strange fire to be brought to it,
   (Leviticus 10:1,) because in sacred things every human mixture is
   absolute profanation. By this figure, therefore, Isaiah was taught that
   all purity flows from God alone.

   7. And applying it to my mouth. [94] We see how God condescends to meet
   the weakness of human sense. He puts the tongs into the hand of a
   seraph, that by means of it he may take a coal from the altar and apply
   it to the Prophet's mouth. This was, no doubt, done in vision; but by
   the aid of the outward sign God assisted the Prophet's understanding.
   There is no reason to believe that the coal possessed any virtue, as
   superstitious persons imagine that in the magical arts there is some
   hidden power. Nothing of this sort is to be found here; for it is God
   alone who can cleanse our pollution, in whatever part it exists.

   Here the angel administered the cleansing, but was not the author of
   it; so that we must not ascribe to another what belongs to God alone.
   This is expressly stated by the angel himself, who claims nothing as
   his own, but bringing forward the sacred pledge which he had received
   from God, laid it as a sacrament on the lips of the Prophet; not that
   he could not be cleansed without the coal, but because the visible sign
   was useful for the confirmation and proof of the fact. And such is the
   use of sacraments, to strengthen us in proportion to our ignorance; for
   we are not angels, that can behold the mysteries of God without any
   assistance, and therefore he raises us to himself by gradual advances.

   Lo, this hath touched thy lips. He shows that the confirmation which
   was obtained by the sign was not without effect, but that the blessing
   signified by it was at the same time bestowed, so that Isaiah knew that
   he had not been deceived. Hence we may infer, that in the sacraments
   the reality is given to us along with the sign; for when the Lord holds
   out a sacrament, he does not feed our eyes with an empty and unmeaning
   figure, but joins the truth with it, so as to testify that by means of
   them he acts upon us efficaciously. And this ought to be the more
   carefully observed, because there are few persons in the present day
   who understand the true use of sacraments, and because many godly and
   learned men are engaged in frequent disputes respecting them.

   First of all, we ought to believe that the truth must never be
   separated from the signs, though it ought to be distinguished from
   them. We perceive and feel a sign, such as the bread which is put into
   our hands by the minister in the Lord's Supper; and because we ought to
   seek Christ in heaven, our thoughts ought to be carried thither. By the
   hand of the minister he presents to us his body, that it may be
   actually enjoyed by the godly, who rise by faith to fellowship with
   him. He bestows it, therefore, on the godly, who raise their thoughts
   to him by faith; for he cannot deceive.

   Unbelievers indeed receive the sign; but because they linger in the
   world, and do not arrive at Christ's heavenly kingdom, they have no
   experience of the truth; for he who has not faith cannot raise his
   thoughts to God, and therefore cannot partake of Christ. Faith alone
   opens for us the gate of the kingdom of God; and therefore, whoever
   wishes to eat the flesh of Christ must be carried by faith to heaven
   beyond human conception. In short, it is the Spirit of God alone who
   can make us partakers of that fellowship. And yet it does not follow
   that the unbelief of men takes anything away from the truth of the
   sacrament, since God always presents to us a spiritual matter, but
   wicked men treat it with scorn; just as the grace of God is offered by
   the gospel, but all do not receive it, though they actually hear it,
   and are compelled to yield assent to the truth.

   Besides, we learn from this passage that the sacraments are never
   separated from the word. The angel does not here act the part of a dumb
   man, but, after having given the sign, immediately adds the doctrine,
   in order to show what was intended by it; for it would have been no
   sacrament, if doctrine had not been added, from which Isaiah could
   learn for what purpose the coal was applied to his mouth. Let us
   therefore learn that the chief part of the sacraments consists in the
   word, and that without it they are absolute corruptions, such as we see
   every day in popery, in which the sacraments are turned into
   stage-plays. The amount of the whole is, that there is nothing to
   prevent Isaiah, who has been perfectly cleansed, and is free from all
   pollution, from appearing as God's representative.

   8. Afterwards I heard the voice of the Lord. The Prophet now begins to
   discourse about the design of this vision, why God appeared to him with
   such glorious majesty, in order to ordain him anew as a prophet. It was
   because he was called to deliver an incredible message about blinding
   the Jews. On this revolting occasion, therefore, he is more fully
   assured of his calling, that he may lay aside fear and obey the command
   of God; for nothing gives greater confidence to pious minds than to
   know that they obey God. He had also another proof, namely, that the
   Lord had cleansed him; and this was sufficient to lead him to undertake
   any task, however difficult.

   Whom shall I send? The Prophet represents the Lord as speaking, as if
   he could not find a man qualified for such a message. Some think that
   this is intended to reprove the ignorance of the priests and prophets;
   because, though they are very numerous, still not one of them was
   qualified to teach. This reason carries some probability, but I would
   rather view it as referring to the certainty of Isaiah's calling, as
   implying that it was not at random, but from choice, that the Lord
   appointed him. There is here, therefore, a weighty deliberation whom
   the Lord will be pleased to send; not that he hesitates, but such modes
   of expression are used on our account, just as these words, I will go
   down and see. (Genesis 18:21.) For God, to whom all things are known,
   has no need to make any inquiry; but, lest men should think that he
   acts with precipitation, he thus accommodates himself to the ordinary
   modes of speaking among men. In like manner, when he asks whom he shall
   send, the meaning is, that he needs not an ordinary person, but a
   teacher of uncommon excellence on a subject of the greatest importance.
   Hence we infer that the authority of Isaiah was confirmed, so that he
   was reckoned to be not only a prophet, but eminent among the prophets.

   Who will go for us? I am rather favorable to the opinion that this
   passage points to Three Persons in the Godhead, just as we elsewhere
   read,

   Let us create man in our likeness. (Genesis 1:26.)

   For God talks with himself, and in the plural number; and
   unquestionably he now holds a consultation with his eternal Wisdom and
   his eternal Power, that is, with the Son and the Holy Spirit.

   Here am I. So ready a reply shows how great is that cheerfulness which
   springs from faith; for he who but lately lay like a dead man dreads no
   difficulty. Hence we see that the amazement of which we have formerly
   spoken did not spring from rebellion, in wishing to flee from God, or
   to refuse the charge which had been laid upon him; but because he
   needed new grace, that he might know that he would be able to endure
   the burden. On this account it ought to be observed, that we cannot
   undertake anything in a proper manner without the evidence of our
   calling; otherwise we shall pause and hesitate at every step.

   Besides, it is a powerful aid to our confidence, when we know that we
   are not destitute of the necessary gifts, but that God has bestowed
   them on us, in order that we may be better enabled to discharge our
   office. Now, this remarkable instance of obedience ought to produce
   such an effect on our minds that we shall readily and cheerfully
   undertake any task which he may be pleased to enjoin, and shall never
   refuse any task, however difficult we may imagine it to be. When the
   Prophet says, Here am I, the meaning is, that he is ready to obey the
   commands of God; for this mode of expression is frequently employed in
   Scripture to denote obedience.

   9. Then he said, Go, and tell that people. [95] This shows still more
   clearly how necessary the vision was, that Isaiah might not all at once
   fail in his course. It was a grievous stumblingblock, that he must
   endure such obstinacy and rebellion in the people of God, and that not
   only for a year or two, but for more than sixty years. On this account
   he needed to be fortified, that he might be like a brazen wall against
   such stubbornness. The Lord, therefore, merely forewarns Isaiah that he
   will have to do with obstinate men, on whom he will produce little
   effect; but that so unusual an occurrence must not lead him to take
   offense, and lose courage, or yield to the rebellion of men; that, on
   the contrary, he must proceed with unshaken firmness, and rise superior
   to temptations of this nature. For God gives him due warning beforehand
   as to the result; as if he had said, "You will indeed teach without any
   good effect; but do not regret your teaching, for I enjoin it upon you;
   and do not refrain from teaching, because it yields no advantage; only
   obey me, and leave to my disposal all the consequences of your labors.
   I give you all this information in good time, that the event may not
   terrify you, as if it had been strange and unexpected." Besides, he is
   commanded openly to reprove their blind obstinacy, as if he purposely
   taunted them.

   "My labors will do no good; but it matters not to me: it is enough that
   what I do obtains the approbation of God, to whom my preaching will be
   a sweet smell, though it bring death to you."
   (2 Corinthians 2:15,16.)

   10. Harden the heart of this people. [96] Here the former statement is
   more fully expressed; for God informs Isaiah beforehand, not only that
   his labor in teaching will be fruitless, but that by his instruction he
   will also blind the people, so as to be the occasion of producing
   greater insensibility and stubbornness, and to end in their
   destruction. He declares that the people, bereft of reason and
   understanding, will perish, and there will be no means of obtaining
   relief; and yet he at the same time affirms that the labors of the
   Prophet, though they bring death and ruin on the Jews, will be to him
   an acceptable sacrifice.

   This is a truly remarkable declaration; not only because Isaiah here
   foretold what was afterwards fulfilled under the reign of Christ, but
   also because it contains a most useful doctrine, which will be of
   perpetual use in the Church of God; for all who shall labor faithfully
   in the ministry of the word will be laid under the necessity of meeting
   with the same result. We too have experienced it more than we could
   have wished; but it has been shared by all the servants of Christ, and
   therefore we ought to endure it with greater patience, though it is a
   very grievous stumbling-block to those who serve God with a pure
   conscience. Not only does it give great offense, but Satan powerfully
   excites his followers to raise a dislike of instruction on the pretense
   of its being not merely useless, but even injurious; that it renders
   men more obstinate, and leads to their destruction. At the present day,
   those who have no other reproach to bring against the doctrine of the
   gospel maintain that the only effect produced by the preaching of it
   has been, that the world has become worse.

   But whatever may be the result, still God assures us that our
   ministrations are acceptable to him, because we obey his command; and
   although our labor appear to be fruitless, and men rush forward to
   their destruction, and become more rebellious, we must go forward; for
   we do nothing at our own suggestion, and ought to be satisfied with
   having the approbation of God. We ought, indeed, to be deeply grieved
   when success does not attend our exertions; and we ought to pray to God
   to give efficacy to his word. A part of the blame we ought even to lay
   on ourselves, when the fruits are so scanty; and yet we must not
   abandon our office, or throw away our weapons. The truth must always be
   heard from our lips, even though there be no ears to receive it, and
   though the world have neither sight nor feeling; for it is enough for
   us that we labor faithfully for the glory of God, and that our services
   are acceptable to him; and the sound of our voice is not ineffectual,
   when it renders the world without excuse.

   Hence arises a most excellent and altogether invaluable consolation to
   godly teachers, for supporting their minds against those grievous
   offenses which daily spring from the obstinacy of men, that, instead of
   being retarded by it, they may persevere in their duty with unshaken
   firmness. As it is also a general offense, that the lively word of God,
   at the hearing of which the whole world ought to tremble, strikes their
   ears to no purpose, and without any advantage, let weak men learn to
   fortify themselves by this declaration. We wonder how it is possible
   that the greater part of men can furiously oppose God; and hence also
   arises a doubt if it be the heavenly truth of God which is rejected
   without bringing punishment; for it can hardly be believed that God
   addresses men for the purpose of exciting their scorn. That our faith
   may not fail, we ought to employ this support, that the office of
   teaching was enjoined on Isaiah, on the condition that, in scattering
   the seed of life, it should yield nothing but death; and that this is
   not merely a narrative of what once happened, but a prediction of the
   future kingdom of Christ, as we shall find to be stated shortly
   afterwards.

   We ought also to attend to this circumstance, that Isaiah was not sent
   to men indiscriminately, but to the Jews. Accordingly, the
   demonstrative particle hnh, (hinneh,) behold, is emphatic, and implies
   that the people whom the Lord had peculiarly chosen for himself do not
   hear the word, and shut their eyes amidst the clearest light. Let us
   not wonder, therefore, if we appear to be like persons talking to the
   deaf, when we address those who boast of the name of God. It is
   undoubtedly a harsh saying, that God sends a prophet to close the ears,
   stop up the eyes, and harden the heart of the people; because it
   appears as if these things were inconsistent with the nature of God,
   and therefore contradicted his word. But we ought not to think it
   strange if God punishes the wickedness of men by blinding them in the
   highest degree. Yet the Prophet shows, a little before, that the blame
   of this blindness lies with the people; for when he bids them hear, he
   bears witness that the doctrine is fitted for instructing the people,
   if they choose to submit to it; that light is given to guide them, if
   they will but open their eyes. The whole blame of the evil is laid on
   the people for rejecting the amazing kindness of God; and hence is
   obtained a more complete solution of that difficulty to which we
   formerly adverted.

   At first sight it seems unreasonable that the Prophets should be
   represented as making men's hearts more hardened. They carry in their
   mouth the word of God, by which, as by a lamp, the steps of men ought
   to be guided; for this encomium, we know, has been pronounced on it by
   David. (Psalm 119:105.) It is not the duty of the Prophets, therefore,
   to blind the eyes, but rather to open them. Again, it is called perfect
   wisdom, (Psalm 19:9;) how then does it stupify men and take away their
   reason? Those hearts which formerly were of brass or iron ought to be
   softened by it; how then is it possible that it can harden them, as I
   have already observed? Such blinding and hardening influence does not
   arise out of the nature of the word, but is accidental, and must be
   ascribed exclusively to the depravity of man. As dim-sighted people
   cannot blame the sun for dazzling their eyes with its brightness; and
   those whose hearing is weak cannot complain of a clear and loud voice
   which the defect of their ears hinders them from hearing; and, lastly,
   a man of weak intellect cannot find fault with the difficulty of a
   subject which he is unable to understand; so ungodly men have no right
   to blame the word for making them worse after having heard it. The
   whole blame lies on themselves in altogether refusing it admission; and
   we need not wonder if that which ought to have led them to salvation
   become the cause of their destruction. It is right that the treachery
   and unbelief of men should be punished by meeting death where they
   might have received life, darkness where they might have had light;
   and, in short, evils as numerous as the blessings of salvation which
   they might have obtained. This ought to be carefully observed; for
   nothing is more customary with men than to abuse the gifts of God, and
   then not only to maintain that they are innocent, but even to be proud
   of appearing in borrowed feathers. But they are doubly wicked when they
   not only do not apply to their proper use, but wickedly corrupt and
   profane, those gifts which God had bestowed on them.

   John quotes this passage as a clear demonstration of the stubbornness
   of the Jews. He does not indeed absolutely give the very words, but he
   states the meaning clearly enough.

   Therefore, says he, they could not believe, because Isaiah said, He
   hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart.
   (John 12:39,40 [97] )

   True, this prediction was not the cause of their unbelief, but the Lord
   foretold it, because he foresaw that they would be such as they are
   here described. The Evangelist applies to the Gospel what had already
   taken place under the law, and at the same time shows that the Jews
   were deprived of reason and understanding, because they were rebels
   against God. Yet if you inquire into the first cause, we must come to
   the predestination of God. But as that purpose is hidden from us, we
   must not too eagerly search into it; for the everlasting scheme of the
   divine purpose is beyond our reach, but we ought to consider the cause
   which lies plainly before our eyes, namely, the rebellion by which they
   rendered themselves unworthy of blessings so numerous and so great.

   Paul, too, shows from this passage, on more than one occasion, (Acts
   28:27; Romans 11:8,) that the whole blame of blindness rests with
   themselves. They have shut their ears, says he, and closed their eyes.
   What Isaiah here ascribes to doctrine, Paul traces to the wicked
   disposition of the nation, which was the cause of their own blindness;
   and accordingly, I have stated that this was an accidental and not a
   natural result of the doctrine. In that passage Paul introduces the
   Spirit as speaking, (Acts 28:25;) but John says that Isaiah spake thus
   of Christ, when he had beheld his glory. (John 12:41.) From this it is
   evident, as we formerly said, that Christ was that God who filled the
   whole earth with his majesty. Now, Christ is not separate from his
   Spirit, and therefore Paul had good reason for applying this passage to
   the Holy Spirit; for although God exhibited to the Prophet the lively
   image of himself in Christ, still it is certain that whatever he
   communicated was wholly breathed into him by the power of the Holy
   Spirit. Now, however ungodly men may bark against us with their
   reproaches, that our doctrine ought to bear the blame, because the
   world is made worse by the preaching of it, they gain nothing at all,
   and take nothing away from the authority of the doctrine; for they must
   at the same time condemn God himself and the whole of his doctrine. But
   their calumnies will not hinder his justice from being displayed, or
   hinder him from vindicating itself, and at the same time vindicating
   us.

   And when they shall be converted [98] Here he expressly declares that
   he did not send the Prophet because he intended to save the people;
   but, on the contrary, because he intended to destroy them. But the word
   of God brings salvation; at least some benefit must arise from the
   preaching of it, that it may do good to some, though many are deprived
   of the advantage by their own unbelief. I answer, the subject treated
   of is the whole body, which had already been condemned and devoted to
   destruction; for there were always some whom the Lord exempted from the
   general ruin; to them the word brought salvation, and on them it
   actually produced its proper effect; but the great body of the people
   were cut off and perished through obstinate unbelief and rebellion. So,
   then, we perceive that the word of God is never so destructive that
   there are not a few who perceive that it brings salvation to them, and
   feel that it does so in reality.

   They shall be healed. We ought also to observe from the order and
   connection of the words, that the first step of healing is repentance.
   But in the first place, we must understand what he means by the word
   healing; for he uses it in reference to the chastisements which had
   been inflicted on the people on account of their sins. Now, the cause
   of all the evils which we endure is our rebellion against God. When we
   repent, he is reconciled to us, and the rods with which he chastised us
   are no longer employed. This is our healing. And this order ought to be
   carefully observed, from which it is evident what object the Lord has
   in view in inviting us to himself, and what is the design of the
   heavenly doctrine, namely, that we may be converted

   This is another part of the Gospel, Repent ye. (Matthew 3:2.) Then,
   offering reconciliation he holds out remedies for all diseases, not
   only of the body but of the soul. And such being the eminent advantage
   derived from the word of God, if we are not reconciled to God as soon
   as his word sounds in our ears, we have no right to lay the blame on
   any other, for it rests wholly with ourselves. Indeed, the Prophet here
   speaks of it as unnatural and monstrous, that, by the doctrine of the
   word, the native tendency of which is to heal and soften, men should
   become insolent and obstinate and altogether incurable. It is
   undoubtedly true, that when we are drawn inwardly, (John 6:44,) it is
   an extraordinary gift of God, and that the arm of God is not revealed
   to all, (Isaiah 53:1;) but by this dreadful punishment of obstinate
   malice, Isaiah intended to teach, that we ought earnestly to beware of
   despising when God calls.

   11. And I said, How long, O LORD? Although the Prophets are severe in
   denouncing the wrath of God against men, yet they do not lay aside
   human feelings. It is therefore necessary that they sustain a twofold
   character; for they must proclaim the judgment of God with high and
   unshaken courage, so that they would rather choose that the world
   should be destroyed and utterly ruined than that any part of His glory
   should be taken away. And yet they are not devoid of feeling, so as to
   be unmoved by compassion for their brethren, whose destruction their
   office lays them under the necessity of foretelling. These two
   feelings, though they appear to be inconsistent, are in full harmony,
   as appears from the instance of Jeremiah, who at first complains of the
   hard task assigned him of proclaiming destruction to the people, but
   afterwards revives his courage, and proceeds boldly in discharging the
   duties of his office (Jeremiah 1:6, 17.) Such was also the state of
   Isaiah's mind; for, being desirous to obey God, he earnestly proclaimed
   His judgments; and yet he had some regard to the people, which led him
   to entreat, that if this blindness must come upon them, it might not be
   permanent. There can be no doubt, that when he thus prayed to God, he
   was moved with compassion, and desired that so dreadful a punishment
   should be mitigated.

   Natural affections, (storgai phusikai,) therefore, ought not to prevent
   us from performing what is our duty. For instance, there is the natural
   affection of a husband to a wife, and of a father to a son; but it
   ought to be checked and restrained, so that we may chiefly consider
   what is suitable to our calling, and what the Lord commands. This ought
   to be carefully observed; for when we wish to give loose reins to
   ourselves, we commonly plead this excuse, that we are willing and ready
   to do what God requires, but are overpowered by natural affection. But
   those feelings ought to be restrained in such a manner as not to
   obstruct our calling; just as they did not hinder the Prophet from
   proceeding in the discharge of his duty; for to such an extent ought we
   to acknowledge the authority of the Lord over us, that when he orders
   and commands, we should forget ourselves and all that belongs to us.

   But although the godly anxiety of Isaiah about the salvation of the
   people is here expressed, still the severity of the punishment is
   likewise stated, that wicked men may not, as they are wont to do,
   indulge the hope of some mitigation. Nor can it be doubted that the
   Prophet was led by a secret impulse from God to ask this, that the
   stern and dreadful reply which immediately follows might be more fully
   brought out; from which it is evident what kind of destruction awaits
   unbelievers, that they will receive no light or moderate punishment,
   but will be utterly destroyed and cut off.

   Until the houses be without man, and the land become a desolation. This
   is an additional aggravation; for it is possible that countries might
   be wasted, and yet that one city might remain; that even cities might
   be stormed and laid desolate, and yet very many houses be left. But
   here the slaughter, he tells us, will be so great, that not only the
   cities, but even the very houses will be thrown down, and the whole
   land will be reduced to frightful and lamentable desolation; though
   even amidst the heaviest calamities some remnant is still left. Though
   Isaiah said this but once, yet let us understand that it is also spoken
   to us; for this punishment has been pronounced against all who
   obstinately disobey God, or who with a stiff neck struggle against his
   yoke. The more violent their opposition, the more resolutely will the
   Lord pursue them till they are utterly destroyed.

   12. Till the Lord have removed men far away. These words contain
   nothing new, but merely an explanation of the former verse, and a
   description by other words of the ruin that shall overtake Judea;
   namely, that God will send the inhabitants far away. He asserts that
   those who shall survive the war will not be exempted from punishment,
   for they will be led into captivity. And next he adds a general clause
   about the desolation of the land; as if he had said that it would be
   desolate and bereft of inhabitants, because some would flee away,
   others would be driven into banishment, and others would perish by the
   sword. Such is the reward prepared for obstinate and rebellious
   persons, who add crime to crime, till the indignation of God rise to
   such a height that it cannot be appeased.

   13. Till there shall be in it a tenth [99] There is some obscurity in
   the words; but let us first ascertain the meaning, and then we shall
   easily find out what is the signification of the words. There are two
   ways of explaining this passage. Some explain syryh (asiriyah) to mean
   decimation; others make it to mean a tenth part, and consider it to be
   a collective noun. Undoubtedly, the Hebrew word syryt, (asirith,) and
   not syryh, (asiriyah,) denotes a tenth part, though the difference
   between them is not great. Those who render it decimation think that a
   truce is promised to the people, because from the reign of Uzziah to
   the destruction of Jerusalem there would be ten kings; and undoubtedly
   that is the number of kings, reckoning from Uzziah to Zedekiah. His
   prophetical doctrine would derive no small support from the
   circumstance, that he could tell the number of kings who should reign
   even after his death, and that he described not only the fact itself,
   but likewise the time, and the day.

   Yet I know not if another meaning be not somewhat more appropriate; for
   the Prophet appears to hold out to the people this consolation, that
   they will retain some hidden vigor, and will be capable of sprouting
   out, though they may appear for a time to be entirely dead; just as,
   when the winter is past, the trees renew their foliage. But as the
   former exposition carries sufficient probability, I shall therefore
   explain the whole verse according to the opinion of those who think
   that mention is here made of ten kings, so as to mean that, when the
   ten kings shall have completed their reign, the people will be carried
   into captivity, and then, as by a conflagration, the whole land will be
   consumed.

   At the same time, the reader ought to be aware that whether syryh
   (asiriyah) be rendered a tenth part, or decimation, it may with the
   utmost propriety be viewed as referring to the people; and then the
   meaning will be, Till the people be diminished to a tenth part. He had
   formerly spoken of a remnant, and a very small remnant, (Isaiah 1:9,)
   and afterwards he will speak of it again, (Isaiah 10:22;) for it was a
   very small number that remained. It might therefore be naturally viewed
   as meaning, that out of a thousand there would be left a hundred; out
   of a hundred, ten; and out of ten, one.

   And shall return. That is, a change will take place for the better: the
   Jews will return from captivity to their native country, and the land
   will assume a new aspect. But this may be thought to be somewhat at
   variance with what follows; for the Prophet immediately adds, It shall
   be destruction. How cold comfort will it yield to the people to be
   restored, if shortly afterwards they shall be again destroyed! Some
   commentators solve this difficulty, by supposing that Isaiah spoke
   about the final destruction of the people. But in my opinion he rather
   means that the destruction will not be complete, but such as happens to
   trees, when their leaves fall off in the winter, and nothing appears
   but dead timber; but when spring returns, they bud forth anew: and so
   also will this people.

   lvr (lebaer) means to burn, [100] and therefore it means here that they
   will be consumed by a conflagration: but we ought to read it in
   connection with the metaphor which immediately follows; for Isaiah does
   not barely mean that it will be consumed, but that it will be consumed
   like the teil-tree, that is, with the hope of immediate recovery. When
   Jerome rendered it for exhibition, I know not on what he supposed that
   opinion to be founded, if it were not that he made a free translation,
   looking rather to the meaning than to the etymology of the word; for
   when trees blossom or put forth leaves, their life is again brought
   forth and displayed; and this meaning will be very appropriate.

   As a teil-tree and an oak. It appears that Isaiah did not select at
   random those two kinds of trees; for one of them puts forth its leaves,
   and likewise sheds them, sooner than the other. So it happened to the
   tribe of Judah; for first the ten tribes, with the half tribe of
   Benjamin, were carried into captivity; and thus they who were the first
   to blossom were likewise the first to decay. This tribe was the latest
   of all in decaying, not without high expectation of blossoming again;
   for here the hope of deliverance is held out, and this was different
   from the captivity of the Israelites. There appears, therefore, to be
   some appropriateness in this metaphor of the trees; but I would not
   choose to press it very far.

   When they cast their leaves. By the phrase, casting of leaves, must be
   understood that throwing of them down which takes place when trees are
   stripped of their leaves as of their garment; for trees, in that state
   of nakedness, appear to be dry and withered; though there remains in
   them a hidden vigor, through which they are at length quickened by the
   returning mildness of the season.

   So in it shall be substance. This is the application of the metaphor,
   which is exceedingly forcible; for when we see the spiritual grace of
   God in the very order of nature, we are strongly confirmed. As Paul
   holds out a likeness of the resurrection in the sowing of corn, which
   is a daily occurrence, (1 Corinthians 15:36,) so in like manner Isaiah
   in this passage describes the restoration of the Church, by taking a
   metaphor from trees, which wither at the end of autumn, but again
   blossom at the return of spring, and put forth new leaves; which could
   not happen, did they not retain some vigor during the winter, though to
   outward appearance they are dead. He foretells that a similar event
   will happen to this people; so that, although during their hard and
   oppressive captivity they resemble dry timber, and it may be thought
   that they can never be delivered, still there will always be preserved
   in them some vigor, by which they shall be supported amidst those
   calamities, and shall at length come forth and blossom.

   This doctrine, we have said, is not peculiar to a single age, and
   therefore it ought to be carefully observed; for it frequently happens
   that the Church, amidst the numerous afflictions which she endures,
   appears to have no strength, and is supposed to be utterly ruined.
   Whenever this takes place, let us fully believe that, notwithstanding
   these appearances, there is still some concealed energy, which, though
   it be not immediately manifest to our eyes, will at length yield its
   fruit. That energy lies hidden in the word of the Lord, by which alone
   the Church is sustained.

   The holy seed. He shows what is that substance, that it consists of a
   small number of the godly, whom he calls the holy seed; for he means
   the elect, who would be preserved by the free mercy of God, and thus
   would survive that captivity. That banishment might be regarded as a
   cleansing of the Church, by which the Lord took away the ungodly; and
   when they had been cut off, he collected a people, small in number, but
   truly consecrated to himself. Some commentators consider this phrase to
   refer to Christ; but the interpretation appears to be too far-fetched,
   and it will be more consistent to extend it to all the godly; for the
   holy seed is the substance of the Church.

   well from the tendency of the ensuing simile of the oak, which is of
   the consolatory kind, as because it is the almost constant practice of
   Isaiah to subjoin to denunciations of divine vengeance a prediction of
   final reconcilement and happiness." Jarchi, as interpreted by

   Isaiah Chapter 7:1-25

   1. And it came to pass, in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
   of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the
   son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war
   against it, but could not prevail against it.

   1. Accidit in diebus Achaz filii Iotham, filii Usiae regis Iuda, ut
   ascenderet Rezin rex Syriae, et Pecah filius Romeliae rex Israel,
   contra Ierusalem, ad oppugnandum eam; sed non potuit expugnare.

   2. And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate
   with Ephraim: and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as
   the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.

   2. Nuntiatum est autem domui David, dicendo, Sociata est Syria cum
   Ephraim; et commotum est cor ejus, sicuti cum ligna sylvae moventur a
   vento.

   3. Then said the Lord unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and
   Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in
   the highway of the fuller's field;

   3. Tunc dixit Iehova ad Isaiam, Egredere in occursum Achaz, tu et
   Sear-jasub filius tuus ad finem aquaeductus piscinae superioris, ad
   viam agri fullonis.

   4. And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be
   faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebands, for the
   fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.

   4. Et dices ad eum, Contine et quiesce; non formides, neque mollescat
   cor tuum propter duas caudas istorum titionum fumigantium, in furore
   irae Rezin, et Syri, et filii Romeliae.

   5. Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil
   counsel against thee, saying,

   5. Eo quod consilium contra te iniit Syrus malignum cum Ephraim et
   filio Romeliae, dicendo:

   6. Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach
   therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of
   Tabeal:

   6. Ascendamus contra Iudam, et excitemus eum, et aperiamus eum nobis;
   constituamusque in medio ejus Regem, filium Tabeal.

   7. Thus saith the Lord God, It shall not stand, neither shall it come
   to pass.

   7. Sic dixit Dominus Iehova, Non consistet, et non erit.

   8. For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
   Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken,
   that it be not a people.

   8. Quoniam caput Syriae, Damascus; et caput Damasci, Rezin. Et quidem
   adhuc sexaginta quinque anni, et frangetur Ephraim, ut non sit populus.

   9. And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
   Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
   established.

   9. Interea caput Ephriam, Samaria; et caput Samariae, filius Romeliae.
   Si non creditis, profecto neque stabitis.

   10. Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

   10. Et adjecit Iehova loqui ad Achaz, dicendo;

   11. Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God; ask it either in the depth, or
   in the height above.

   11. Pete tibi signum a Iehova Deo tuo, petendo in profundo, vel sursum
   in excelso.

   12. But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.

   12. Et ait Achaz, Non petam; et non tentabo Iehovam.

   13. And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for
   you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

   13. Et dixit, Audite nunc domus David; An parum est vobis, hominibus
   molestos esse, nisi Deo quoque meo sitis molesti?

   14. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin
   shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

   14. Propterea dabit vobis Dominus ipse signum: Ecce virgo concipiet, et
   pariet filium; et vocabit nomen ejus Immanuel.

   15. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil,
   and choose the good.

   15. Butyrum et mel comedet, donec sciat reprobare malum, et eligere
   bonum.

   16. For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the
   good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.

   16. Et quidem antequam sciat puer rejicere malum et eligere bonum,
   relinquetur terra quam odisti, a duobus Regibus suis.

   17. The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy
   father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim
   departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

   17. Adducet Iehova super te, et super populum tuum, et super domum
   patris tui, dies qui non venerunt a die defectionis Ephraim a Iuda:
   nempe, Regem Assur.

   18. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for
   the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for
   the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

   18. Erit in die illa: sibilabit Iehova muscae, quae est in extremitate
   fluminum AEgypti, et api quae est in terra Assur.

   19. And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate
   valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon
   all bushes.

   19. Venientque, et quiescent omnes in vallibus desertis, et in cavernis
   petrarum, et in omnibus spinetis, et in omnibus dumetis.

   20. In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired,
   namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and
   the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.

   20. In die illa radet Dominus novacula conducta, per hos qui trans
   fluvium sunt, per Regem Assur, caput et pilos pedum; quin et barbam
   tollet.

   21. And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a
   young cow and two sheep;

   21. Fietque in die illa, ut homo nutriat vaccam armenti et duas oves.

   22. And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they
   shall give, that he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every
   one eat that is left in the land.

   22. Et eveniet, ut propter copiam lactis quam proferent, comedet
   butyrum. Butyrum certe et mel comedet quisquis residuus fuerit in medio
   terrae.

   23. And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be,
   where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall
   even be for briers and thorns.

   23. Erit etiam in die illa, ut quocunque in loco fuerint mille vites,
   prostent mille argenteis propter spinas et vepres.

   24. With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the
   land shall become briers and thorns.

   24. Cum sagittis et arcu venient illuc; quoniam spinae et vepres erunt
   per universam terram.

   25. And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall
   not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the
   sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

   25. Porro quod ad omnes montes qui sarculo fodiuntur, non veniet illuc
   timor spinarum et veprium; sed expositi erunt bobus, et conculcabuntur
   a pecoribus.


   1. And it came to pass. Here is related a remarkable prophecy about the
   wonderful deliverance of Jerusalem, when it appeared to have been
   utterly ruined. Now the Prophet explains all the circumstances, that by
   means of them the miracle may be more fully displayed, and to make it
   manifest, that not by the wisdom or power of man, but by the favor of
   God, the city has been preserved. For so ungrateful were the people,
   that, at the close of this transaction, they would not have understood
   that they had been delivered by the hand of the Lord, if all the
   circumstances had not been expressly brought to their remembrance. And,
   indeed, there were very few persons who, in the hour of danger,
   ventured to hope what Isaiah promised; because they judged of
   themselves and of the state of public affairs from present appearances.
   In order, therefore, to make known the remarkable kindness of God, he
   enters into all the details, that they may perceive from what danger
   and from whose hand they have been delivered. Let us also understand
   that this kindness was conferred on ungrateful men, that the Church
   might be preserved, and that Christ might afterwards appear.

   It ought to be observed that the Prophet speaks of the second war which
   was fought by Rezin and Pekah; and this may easily be inferred from the
   sacred history; for in the former war Ahaz was vanquished, and a vast
   multitude were carried into captivity, who were at length restored by
   the Israelites, when the Prophet, in the name of God, commanded that it
   should be done. Having again collected an army, (2 Kings 16:5,) the
   kings of Israel and Syria attacked Ahaz, because they thought that he
   had been worn out by the former war, and had no power to resist. The
   mention of this second war is intended to show the greatness of the
   miracle; for Ahaz had not strength left to resist so great a multitude,
   the flower of the whole nation having been swept away by the former
   war, and such of the people as remained being quite dispirited, and not
   yet recovered from the terror arising out of their recent defeat. So
   much the more, therefore, are the goodness and power of God displayed,
   that, pitying so great distress, he gave assistance to his people, and
   in a moment rescued them from the jaws of death, when all regarded
   their condition as hopeless.

   Went up. This may be regarded as a statement and summary of the whole
   transaction; for he mentions the subjects on which he is about to
   speak, and in the Hebrew modes of expression briefly glances at those
   matters which he will afterwards explain more fully and at large. From
   the first he tells the result, that the expedition of the two kings was
   unsuccessful, and afterwards he will assign the reasons why Jerusalem
   could not be stormed; but before coming to that, he briefly notices the
   plan or design of King Ahaz.

   2. And it was told the house of David. He does not mean that, at the
   very time when the two kings were approaching to the city, the king
   received intelligence about the league; for it would not have been safe
   for Ahaz to go out, when the invading army was spread over the country;
   but before they had collected their forces, it is said that King Ahaz
   trembled. Hence there is reason to believe that his consternation
   became greater when he saw the danger nearer. The house of David means
   the king's palace and court; as if the Prophet had said that Ahaz and
   his counsellors had been informed about the conspiracy which had been
   formed against Judea.

   As to the words, nchh (nachah) is variously rendered by interpreters.
   The signification of this Hebrew word being to lead, some draw from it
   this meaning, "The King of Syria led his soldiers to aid the army;" and
   they think that l (al) with (ain) is put for 'l (al) with ' (aleph).
   Others derive it from nvch (nuach), as if the letter v (vau) were
   wanting, and render it, he rested. According to others, it is rather an
   inversion of the letters, and nchh (nahah) is put for chnh (chanah),
   which means to pitch a camp; and, therefore, they choose to render it,
   Syria is confederate [101] Nothing else was meant by the Prophet than
   that a league in war hath been formed between the Israelites and the
   Syrians, that with their united forces they might attack Jerusalem. In
   the use of the word Ephraim there is a figure of speech (synecdoche)
   very frequent in the Prophets, by which a part is taken for the whole.
   Under Ephraim the whole kingdom of Israel is included, not only because
   that tribe was superior to the rest in numbers and wealth, but because
   their first king, Jeroboam, was descended from it. (1 Kings 11:26.)

   And his heart was moved. We see that by the house of David is here
   meant nothing else than "the king's palace," from which the terror
   spread to the whole nation; and indeed it was impossible but that, when
   they heard of the alarm of the king and the princes, the body of the
   people should be moved by the same kind of terror. As soon as this
   intelligence was received, all were struck with such dread that no man
   was master of himself. He expresses their trembling by an appropriate
   metaphor, which is also frequently employed by ourselves, (Il tremble
   comme la fueille en l'arbre,) he trembles like the leaf of a tree. The
   design of this is to heighten the miracle; for we learn from it that
   not only in the opinion of others, but likewise in their own opinion,
   their case was desperate. They would therefore have been utterly ruined
   if the Lord had not seasonably interposed.

   This passage sets before us a very bright mirror, in which we may
   behold the thoughtlessness of the ungodly, when they do not feel the
   hand of God; and, on the other hand, the fearful trembling with which
   they are suddenly seized, when the Lord presents to them any danger. In
   the midst of their prosperity they are so much at their ease that they
   hardly believe that they are subject to the government of God, and
   undoubtedly imagine that they are placed beyond the reach of all
   danger. Adversity stuns them in such a manner that they suddenly fall
   down, and their senses are so entirely overpowered by terror that they
   lie like people who are lifeless or bereft of their senses. Such is the
   punishment by which the Lord arouses them from their deep slumber. At
   first they appear to be firm and immovable, as if nothing could throw
   them down from their rank; but now, at the slightest noise, they are
   suddenly seized with trembling. That terror is the righteous vengeance
   of God, to whom they never do homage until they are compelled.

   Let us learn, that if we have any spark of faith, we ought not to
   distrust God when we are in any danger. It is indeed impossible that we
   should not be agitated and alarmed when dangers press upon us; but we
   ought not to tremble so as to be tossed about by our anxiety in every
   direction, and unable to see a harbour to which we may safely direct
   our course. There must always be this difference between the fear of
   the godly and of the ungodly, that the ungodly find no remedy for
   composing their minds; but the godly immediately betake themselves to
   God, in whom, knowing that they have a very safe harbour, though they
   be harassed by uneasiness, still they remain calm.

   3. Then said the LORD. First, we see how God, remembering his covenant,
   anticipates this wicked king by sending the Prophet to meet him; for he
   does not wait for his prayers, but of his own accord promises that he
   will grant deliverance. His son Shear-jashub is joined with the Prophet
   as a witness of the prediction, and there is reason to believe that his
   name, Shear-jashub, was not given at random, but by the secret
   inspiration of the Spirit, or by an immediate command of God, and in
   order to point out the future deliverance of the people. He, therefore,
   carried in his name what might be regarded as an engraven seal, both of
   the approaching captivity and of the return. It is also probable that
   this symbol of the prediction was generally known, for he would not
   have been joined with his father on any other account than because he
   bore in his person some authority.

   To the way of the fuller's field. The place is mentioned in order to
   give authenticity to the history. It is possible that the king, for the
   purpose of repelling the enemy, may have set out to watch his approach,
   which appears more clearly from the sacred history. (2 Kings 18:17.) It
   is called the way of the fuller's field, perhaps because it was
   customary to wash clothes there, or because the name arose out of some
   ancient occurrence. However that may be, it was an evidence of anxiety
   and dread, that this wretched hypocrite was running about in all
   directions, when Isaiah came forth to meet him and to soothe his mind.

   4. And thou shalt say to him [102] The Hebrew word smr (shamar,) which
   signifies to keep, is here put in the Hiphil; [103] and the greater
   part of interpreters take it for beware; but they erroneously apply
   this to an unnatural and far-fetched meaning, that Ahaz should beware
   of carrying on war. A more natural meaning is, that he ought not to
   waver or wander about in uncertainty, but to remain calm and serene.
   Accordingly, I have rendered it refrain. The meaning therefore is, that
   Ahab should be composed, and should not be agitated or harass his mind
   by uneasiness, as fickle and unsteady persons are wont to do when they
   are struck with terror.

   This interpretation is confirmed by the word which follows, Be quiet;
   for these two are connected, first, to keep quiet watch, so as not to
   be distracted by a variety of opinions, or gaze around in all
   directions; and, secondly, to have a calm and composed mind. Such are
   the highly delightful fruits which are yielded by faith; for through a
   variety of attacks unbelievers give way, and wander in uncertainty, and
   know not to which hand they ought to turn, while believers keep
   themselves under restraint, and quietly betake themselves to God.
   Ungodliness is never at rest; but where faith exists, there the mind is
   composed, and does not tremble to an immoderate degree. These words
   very fitly express the power of faith.

   Fear not. After having pointed out the remedy for allaying the
   distresses of the mind, he likewise bids them not fear; for faith,
   which places our salvation in the hand of God, is not more opposite to
   anything than to fear. It is impossible, I acknowledge, not to fear
   when dangers threaten, for faith does not deprive us of all feeling. On
   the contrary, the children of God are undoubtedly moved by two kinds of
   fear, one of which arises from the feeling of human nature, even though
   they be endued with perfect faith. The other arises from the weakness
   of faith; for no man has made such proficiency as not to have any
   remains of that distrust against which we ought continually to strive.
   We must not, therefore, understand the exhortation of the Prophet to
   mean that the Lord forbids every kind of fear, but he enjoins believers
   to be armed with such firmness as to overcome fear. As if he had said,
   "Do not suffer yourselves to be discouraged; and if you are assailed by
   fierce and severe attacks, maintain unshaken resolution, that you may
   not be overpowered by dangers, but, on the contrary, live to God and
   overcome all your distresses." For the same reason he immediately adds,
   --

   And let not thy heart be faint. To be faint means "to melt away," for
   not without reason does the Apostle exhort us to strengthen our hearts
   by faith. (Hebrews 11:27; 13:9.) It is the softness of indolence, when
   we forget God and melt away, as it were, through our unbelief. You
   would not call that man soft or effeminate who relies on the Spirit of
   God and steadfastly resists adversity. Hence we infer that the Prophet
   meant nothing else than that Ahaz should undauntedly await the
   accomplishment of what the Lord had promised to him.

   For the two tails. Isaiah employs an elegant metaphor to lessen the
   conception which the Jews had formed about those two very powerful
   kings which had filled their minds with terror. Their rage and cruelty
   appeared to be a devouring fire, which was sufficient to consume the
   whole of Judea, and could not be quenched. Isaiah, on the other hand,
   calls them not firebrands, (for that might have been thought to be
   something great,) but tails, that is, some fragments or ends of
   firebrands, and these, too, not burning, but only smoking, as if some
   firebrand snatched from the fire were going out, and gave out nothing
   else than a slight smoke. This metaphor yields high consolation, for it
   warns us to form a very different opinion about the violence of the
   ungodly from what it appears to be. One would think that they are
   endued with so great power that they could burn and destroy the whole
   world. To put down the excess of terror, the Lord declares that what we
   imagined to be a burning, and a perpetual burning, is but a slight
   smoke and of short duration.

   5. The king of Syria hath taken evil counsel against thee. Though he
   foretold that empty would be the threats, and vain the attempts of the
   enemies of the people of God, yet he does not conceal that their
   devices are cruel, if the Lord do not restrain them. By evil counsel he
   means destructive counsel, for these two kings had leagued together to
   destroy Judea. To express it more fully, and to place it as it were
   before their eyes, he relates their very words.

   6. Let us go up. That is, Let us make an invasion nqytsnh (nekitzennah)
   is rendered by some, Let us distress or afflict; which is also
   expressed by the derivation of the word. But in this conjugation it
   rather signifies "to stir up and arouse." Though I do not reject the
   former interpretation, yet I prefer the latter, because it agrees
   better with the scope of the passage. Again, I understand the word
   arouse as meaning to disturb, and to cause revolutions; as we commonly
   say, to raise disturbances, [104] so as not to allow the tranquillity
   of that kingdom to be preserved.

   Let us open it to us. The following word, nvqynh, (nabkignennah,) is
   interpreted by some, Let us break into it [105] Others render it, Let
   us cause it to break up to us. I have rendered it, Let us open; for vq
   (bakang) also signifies what we commonly express by the phrase, to make
   a breach or opening [106] Now, the way to open up the entrance to Judea
   was to rush through its fortifications by the force of arms, or,
   through the influence of fear, to induce timid and fickle persons to
   revolt; for so long as they continue to be loyal, entrance cannot be
   obtained; but when everything is disturbed by insurrections, an
   entrance is made, so that it becomes easy to break through into the
   strongest and best fortified places.

   Thus, these two kings hoped that, as soon as they came into Judea, they
   would immediately terrify the whole nation by the extent and power of
   the army, so that there would be no ability or inclination to resist.
   When they brought together an army so prodigiously numerous, it is not
   probable that they placed any dependence on a long siege; for Jerusalem
   was strongly fortified; but they thought that the inhabitants of
   Jerusalem would be terrified and alarmed at the sight of their forces,
   and would be induced to make an immediate surrender. Yet I leave it to
   every person to adopt any interpretation of these words that he
   pleases, for whatever sense be put upon them, the meaning of the
   Prophet is not doubtful.

   The son of Tabeal. Who this Tabeal was cannot easily be learned from
   history. Probably he was some Israelite, an enemy of the house of
   David, whom those kings were desirous to set up as one of their own
   dependents.

   7. It shall not stand. What he had formerly stated was intended to show
   more fully that the deliverance was great and uncommon; for when the
   Lord intends to assist us in our trials, he represents the greatness of
   the danger, that we may not think that he promises less than the
   necessity requires. He does not usually give a mitigated view of the
   evils which press upon us, but rather holds out their full extent, and
   afterwards makes a promise, and shows that he is able to deliver us,
   though we may appear to be ruined. Such was the method adopted by the
   Prophet; for he might have told them in plain terms what would happen,
   and might have encouraged the king and the nation not to be terrified
   or discouraged at the sight of those armies. But he opened up the
   scheme and design of those kings, with which he now contrasts the
   promise and decree of God, that his wonderful assistance may be more
   strikingly displayed.

   This is the sacred anchor which alone upholds us amidst the billows of
   temptations; for in adversity we shall never be able to stand if God
   take away his word from us. Although, therefore, the king was almost
   overwhelmed with despair, Isaiah shows that there is nothing so
   dreadful that it may not be despised, provided that he fortify himself
   by the promise of God, and patiently look for that which is not yet
   seen, and which even appears to be incredible. He affirms, that
   whatever men attempt, after the manner of the giants, in rising up
   against God, it shall not stand. He uses the word tqym, (thakum,) shall
   arise, in the same sense in which that metaphor is employed in the
   Latin language, that a work is making progress; and, in a word, he
   declares that such daring sacrilege shall not stand

   Still more emphatic is that which he adds, l' thyh, (lo thihyeh,) it
   shall not be; that is, it shall be reduced to nothing, as if it had
   never existed. This mode of expression deserves notice, for it was the
   bare and naked word of God which was contrasted with the vast army and
   scheme of the kings.

   8. For the head of Syria is Damascus. As if he had said, "Those two
   kings shall have their limits, such as they have them now. They aspire
   to thy kingdom; but I have set bounds to them which they shall not
   pass." Damascus was the metropolis of Syria, as Paris is of France. He
   says, therefore, that those kings ought to be satisfied with their
   possessions, and that their future condition would be the same as it
   then was.

   And Ephraim shall be broken. After having said that it is now useless
   to attempt to extend their boundaries, he foretells the calamity of the
   kingdom of Israel; for by the word broken he means that the kingdom of
   Israel shall be annihilated, so that it shall no longer exist. The
   Israelites were carried into captivity, and incorporated with another
   nation, just as in our own time a part of Savoy has passed under the
   government of France, and has lost its name. This is what the Prophet
   means, when he says mm, (megnam,) that it be not a people; for at that
   time Israel was mixed with foreign nations, and its peculiar name was
   blotted out.

   Within sixty-five years. The Israelites were led into captivity in the
   sixth year of King Hezekiah, and Ahaz reigned not more than sixteen
   years; and, therefore, it is certain that this calculation ought not to
   be made from the day on which Isaiah was sent to deliver this message,
   for it was only twenty years to the time when the ten tribes were
   carried into captivity. Amoz had prophesied of that captivity; and
   there can be no doubt that this prophecy of Amoz, (Amos 3:11,) and the
   time specified in it were generally known, and that all understood the
   reckoning of the number of years. If, therefore, we reckon from the
   time when Amoz makes this prediction, we shall find it to be sixty-five
   years; for Jotham reigned sixteen years, (2 Kings 15:33;) Ahaz as many,
   (2 Kings 16:2;) to those must be added six years of King Hezekiah,
   which brings us down to the year when the ten tribes were carried into
   captivity; and if we afterwards add twenty-seven years, during which
   Uzziah reigned after the publication of the prophecy, there will be
   sixty-five years This conjecture is highly probable; and there ought
   not to be any doubt that this was Isaiah's meaning; for there is a
   prediction of the Prophet Amoz, in which the Lord warned the people
   that they might not meet with anything unexpected, and complain that
   they had been overtaken suddenly. Isaiah confirms that prediction, and
   announces the same time which already was universally known.

   Moreover, by these words he sharply reproves the thoughtlessness of the
   Israelitish nation, that, when they had been warned of the destruction
   of their country and their name, not only did they freely indulge in
   despising the judgment of God, but as if they had purposely intended to
   mock at the heavenly predictions, they opened their mouth to devour
   Judea; for a long period was already past, and they thought that they
   had escaped. The Prophet ridicules this madness, in imagining that the
   word of God grew old in so small a number of years. But because the
   Israelites were deaf, Isaiah assigns to the Jews a time when they may
   look for the destruction of their enemies. Now, this passage shows that
   the Prophets faithfully assisted each other, that by their united
   labors they might serve God.

   9. Meanwhile [107] the head of Ephraim is Samaria. As it is a
   repetition by which he confirms what he formerly said, that God had set
   bounds to the kingdom of Israel for an appointed time, I have rendered
   the copulative v, (vau,) meanwhile. Otherwise, it would have been
   absurd to say that the metropolis of the kingdom would be preserved,
   after that the kingdom had been destroyed, as he lately foretold. The
   meaning therefore is, "In the meantime, till the sixty-five years are
   fulfilled, Israel enjoys a kind of truce. His head shall be Samaria.
   Let him be satisfied with his boundaries, and not aim at anything
   beyond them; for such shall be his condition, until he be utterly
   destroyed, and be no longer reckoned to be a people."

   If you do not believe. The particle ky (ki) is placed in the middle of
   the sentence, to mark the reason or cause; and, therefore, some render
   it, "If you do not believe, the reason is, that you are not believers."
   They limit the former clause to the prophecy of Isaiah, but extend the
   latter to any part of the word of God, as if he had said, "If you have
   no faith in my sayings, this gives a general proof of your unbelief."
   But in that way, the verb t'mynv, (thaaminu,) which is in Hiphil
   conjugation, will not differ from the verb t'mnv, (theamenu,) which is
   in the Niphal. It is not without reason, however, that the Prophet has
   changed the termination; and, from many passages of Scripture, it is
   abundantly evident that the Hebrew verb 'mn, (aman,) in the Niphal
   conjugation, signifies to stand, or, to remain fixed in its condition.
   I interpret it, therefore, as if he had said, "This is the only support
   on which you can rely. Wait calmly and without uneasiness of mind for
   what the Lord has promised, that is, deliverance. If you do not wait
   for it, what else remains for you than destruction?"

   The particle ky, (ki,) therefore, as in many other instances, means
   truly; for he declares that they cannot stand, if they do not rely on
   the promise; and indirectly he expresses still more, that God will
   stand, though they disbelieve his word, and, as far as lies in their
   power, endeavor to destroy its stability; but that they will not stand,
   unless they rely on the promise which has been made to them.

   Hence we ought to draw a universal doctrine, that, when we have
   departed from the word of God, though we may suppose that we are firmly
   established, still ruin is at hand. For our salvation is bound up with
   the word of God, and, when this is rejected, the insult offered to it
   is justly punished by him who was ready to uphold men by his power, if
   they had not of their own accord rushed headlong to ruin. The
   consequence is, that either we must believe the promises of God, or it
   is in vain for us to expect salvation.

   10. And Jehovah added to speak to Ahaz. [108] As the Lord knew that
   King Ahaz was so wicked as not to believe the promise, so he enjoins
   Isaiah to confirm him by adding a sign; for when God sees that his
   promises do not satisfy us, he makes additions to them suitable to our
   weakness; so that we not only hear him speak, but likewise behold his
   hand displayed, and thus are confirmed by an evident proof of the fact.
   Here we ought carefully to observe the use of signs, that is, the
   reason why God performs miracles, namely, to confirm us in the belief
   of his word; for when we see his power, if we have any hesitation about
   what he says to us, our doubt is removed by beholding the thing itself;
   for miracles added to the word are seals.

   11. Either in the deep. I understand it simply to mean Either above or
   below. He allows him an unrestricted choice of a miracle, to demand
   either what belongs to earth or what belongs to heaven. But perhaps in
   the word deep there is something still more emphatic; as if he had
   said, "It belongs to you to choose. God will immediately show that his
   dominion is higher than this world, and that it likewise extends to all
   depths, so that at his pleasure he can raise the dead from their
   graves." It was undoubtedly astonishing forbearance towards this wicked
   king and people of God, that not only did he patiently bear their
   distrust for a time, but so graciously condescended to them that he was
   willing to give them any pledge of his power which they chose. Yet he
   had in his eye not unbelievers only, but he intended likewise to
   provide for the benefit of the weak, in whom there was a seed of
   godliness; that they might be fully convinced that Isaiah did not speak
   at random, for he could easily give a proof of the power of God in
   confirmation of what he had said.

   The same goodness of God is now also displayed towards men, to whom he
   exercises such forbearance, when he might justly have been offended at
   them; for how shockingly do they insult God, when they doubt his truth?
   What do you leave to God, if you take that from him? And whatever may
   be our doubts, not only does he pardon us, but even aids our distrust,
   and not only by his word, but by adding miracles; and he exhibits them
   not only to believers, but also to the ungodly, which we may behold in
   this king. And if he was at that time so kind to strangers, what ought
   not his own people to expect from him?

   12. And Ahaz said. By a plausible excuse he refuses the sign which the
   Lord offered to him. That excuse is, that he is unwilling to tempt the
   LORD; for he pretends to believe the words of the Prophet, and to ask
   nothing more from God than his word. Ungodliness is certainly
   detestable in the sight of God, and in like manner God unquestionably
   sets a high value on faith. Accordingly, if a man rely on his word
   alone, and disregard everything else, it might be thought that he
   deserves the highest praise; for there can be no greater perfection
   than to yield full submission and obedience to God.

   But a question arises. Do we tempt God, when we accept what he offers
   to us? Certainly not. Ahaz therefore speaks falsehood, when he pretends
   that he refuses the sign, because he is unwilling to tempt God; for
   there can be nothing fitter or more excellent than to obey God, and
   indeed it is the highest virtue to ask nothing beyond the word of God;
   and yet if God choose to add anything to his word, it ought not to be
   regarded as a virtue to reject this addition as superfluous. It is no
   small insult offered to God, when his goodness is despised in such a
   manner as if his proceedings towards us were of no advantage, and as if
   he did not know what it is that we chiefly need. We know that faith is
   chiefly commended on this ground, that it maintains obedience to him;
   but when we wish to be too wise, and despise anything that belongs to
   God, we are undoubtedly abominable before God, whatever excuse we may
   plead before men. While we believe the word of God, we ought not to
   despise the aids which he has been pleased to add for the purpose of
   strengthening our faith.

   For instance, the Lord offers to us in the gospel everything necessary
   for salvation; for when he brings us into a state of fellowship with
   Christ, the sum of all blessings is truly contained in him. What then
   is the use of Baptism and the Lord's Supper? Must they be regarded as
   superfluous? Not at all; for any one who shall actually, and without
   flattery, acknowledge his weakness, of which all from the least to the
   greatest are conscious, will gladly avail himself of those aids for his
   support. We ought indeed to grieve and lament, that the sacred truth of
   God needs assistance on account of the defect of our flesh; but since
   we cannot all at once remove this defect, any one who, according to his
   capacity shall believe the word, will immediately render full obedience
   to God. Let us therefore learn to embrace the signs along with the
   word, since it is not in the power of man to separate them.

   When Ahaz refuses the sign offered to him, by doing so he displays both
   his obstinacy and his ingratitude; for he despises what God had offered
   for the highest advantage. Hence also it is evident how far we ought to
   ask signs, namely, when God offers them to us; and therefore he who
   shall reject them when offered, must also reject the grace of God. In
   like manner fanatics of the present day disregard Baptism and the
   Lord's Supper, and consider them to be childish elements. They cannot
   do this without at the same time rejecting the whole gospel; for we
   must not separate those things which the Lord has commanded us to join.

   But a question may be asked, Is it not sometimes lawful to ask signs
   from the Lord? For we have an instance of this in Gideon, who wished to
   have his calling confirmed by some sign. (Judges 6:17.) The Lord
   granted his prayer, and did not disapprove of such a desire. I answer,
   though Gideon was not commanded by God to ask a sign, yet he did so,
   not at his own suggestion, but by an operation of the Holy Spirit. We
   must not abuse his example, therefore, so that each of us may freely
   allow himself that liberty; for so great is the forwardness of men that
   they do not hesitate to ask innumerable signs from God without any
   proper reason. Such effrontery ought therefore to be restrained, that
   we may be satisfied with those signs which the Lord offers to us.

   Now, there are two kinds of signs; for some are extraordinary, and may
   be called supernatural; such as that which the Prophet will immediately
   add, and that which, we shall afterwards see, was offered to Hezekiah.
   (Isaiah 38:7.) Some are ordinary, and in daily use among believers,
   such as Baptism and the Lord's Supper, which contain no miracle, or at
   least may be perceived by the eye or by some of the senses. What the
   Lord miraculously performs by his Spirit is unseen, but in those which
   are extraordinary the miracle itself is seen. Such is also the end and
   use of all signs; for as Gideon was confirmed by an astonishing
   miracle, so we are confirmed by Baptism and the Lord's Supper, though
   our eyes behold no miracle.

   13. And he said, Hear now, O house of David. Under the pretense of
   honor to exclude the power of God, which would maintain the truth of
   the promise, was intolerable wickedness; and therefore the Prophet
   kindles into warmer indignation, and more sharply rebukes wicked
   hypocrites. Though it would have been honorable to them to be reckoned
   the descendants of David, provided that they imitated his piety, yet it
   is rather for the sake of reproach that he calls them the posterity or
   family of David. It was indeed no small aggravation of the baseness,
   that the grace of God was rejected by that family from which the
   salvation of the whole world would proceed. Grievous disgrace must have
   been brought on them, by naming their ancestry, from which they had so
   basely and shamefully degenerated.

   This order ought to be carefully observed; for we ought not to begin
   with severe reproof, but with doctrine, that men may be gently drawn by
   it. When plain and simple doctrine is not sufficient, proofs must be
   added. But if even this method produce no good effect, it then becomes
   necessary to employ greater vehemence. Such is the manner in which we
   hear Isaiah thundering on the present occasion. After having exhibited
   to the king both doctrine and signs, he now resorts to the last remedy,
   and sharply and severely reproves an obstinate man; and not him only,
   but the whole royal family which was guilty of the same kind of
   impiety.

   Is it a small thing for you to weary men? He makes a comparison between
   God and men; not that it is possible to make an actual separation
   between God and the prophets and holy teachers of whom he speaks, who
   are nothing else than God's instruments, and make common cause with
   him, when they discharge their duty; for of them the Lord testifies,

   He who despiseth you despiseth me.
   He who heareth you heareth me. (Luke 10:16.)

   The Prophet therefore adapts his discourse to the impiety of Ahaz, and
   of those who resembled him; for they thought that they had to deal with
   men. Those very words were undoubtedly spoken in ancient times which we
   hear at the present day from the mouths of the ungodly: "Are they not
   men that speak to us?" And thus they endeavor to disparage the doctrine
   which comes from God. As it was customary at that time for irreligious
   despisers of doctrine to use the same kind of language, the Prophet, by
   way of admission, says that those who performed the sacred office of
   teaching the word were men. "Be it so. You tell me that I am a mortal
   man. That is the light in which you view the prophets of God. But is it
   a small thing to weary us, if you do not also weary God? Now, you
   despise God, by rejecting the sign of his astonishing power which he
   was willing to give to you. In vain therefore do you boast that you do
   not despise him, and that you have to do with men, and not with God."
   This then is the reason why the Prophet was so greatly enraged. Hence
   we see more clearly what I mentioned a little before, that the proper
   season for giving reproofs is, when we have attempted everything that
   God enjoined, and have neglected no part of our duty. We ought then to
   break out with greater vehemence, and to expose the ungodliness which
   lurked under those cloaks of hypocrisy.

   My God. He formerly said, Ask a sign for thee from the Lord thy God;
   for at that time his obstinacy and rebellion had not been manifestly
   proved. But now he claims it as peculiar to himself; for Ahaz, and
   those who resembled him, had no right to boast of the name of God. He
   therefore intimates that God is on his side, and is not on the side of
   those hypocrites: and in this way he testifies his confidence; for he
   shows how conscientiously he promised deliverance to the king; as if he
   had said, that he did not come but when God sent him, and that he said
   nothing but what he was commanded to say. With the same boldness ought
   all ministers to be endued, not only so as to profess it, but to have
   it deeply rooted in their hearts. The false prophets also boast of it
   loudly, but it is empty and unmeaning talk, or a blind confidence
   arising from rashness.

   14. Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Ahaz had already
   refused the sign which the Lord offered to him, when the Prophet
   remonstrated against his rebellion and ingratitude; yet the Prophet
   declares that this will not prevent God from giving the sign which he
   had promised and appointed for the Jews. But what sign?

   Behold, a virgin shall conceive. This passage is obscure; but the blame
   lies partly on the Jews, who, by much cavilling, have labored, as far
   as lay in their power, to pervert the true exposition. They are hard
   pressed by this passage; for it contains an illustrious prediction
   concerning the Messiah, who is here called Immanuel; and therefore they
   have labored, by all possible means, to torture the Prophet's meaning
   to another sense. Some allege that the person here mentioned is
   Hezekiah; and others, that it is the son of Isaiah.

   Those who apply this passage to Hezekiah are excessively impudent; for
   he must have been a full-grown man when Jerusalem was besieged. Thus
   they show that they are grossly ignorant of history. But it is a just
   reward of their malice, that God hath blinded them in such a manner as
   to be deprived of all judgment. This happens in the present day to the
   papists, who often expose themselves to ridicule by their mad eagerness
   to pervert the Scriptures.

   As to those who think that it was Isaiah's son, it is an utterly
   frivolous conjecture; for we do not read that a deliverer would be
   raised up from the seed of Isaiah, who should be called Immanuel; for
   this title is far too illustrious to admit of being applied to any man.

   Others think, or, at least, (being unwilling to contend with the Jews
   more than was necessary,) admit that the Prophet spoke of some child
   who was born at that time, by whom, as by an obscure picture, Christ
   was foreshadowed. But they produce no strong arguments, and do not show
   who that child was, or bring forward any proofs. Now, it is certain, as
   we have already said, that this name Immanuel could not be literally
   applied to a mere man; and, therefore, there can be no doubt that the
   Prophet referred to Christ.

   But all writers, both Greek and Latin, are too much at their ease in
   handling this passage; for, as if there were no difficulty in it, they
   merely assert that Christ is here promised from the Virgin Mary. Now,
   there is no small difficulty in the objection which the Jews bring
   against us, that Christ is here mentioned without any sufficient
   reason; for thus they argue, and demand that the scope of the passage
   be examined: "Jerusalem was besieged. The Prophet was about to give
   them a sign of deliverance. Why should he promise the Messiah, who was
   to be born five hundred years afterwards?" By this argument they think
   that they have gained the victory, because the promise concerning
   Christ had nothing to do with assuring Ahaz of the deliverance of
   Jerusalem. And then they boast as if they had gained the day, chiefly
   because scarcely any one replies to them. That is the reason why I said
   that commentators have been too much at their ease in this matter; for
   it is of no small importance to show why the Redeemer is here
   mentioned.

   Now, the matter stands thus. King Ahaz having rejected the sign which
   God had offered to him, the Prophet reminds him of the foundation of
   the covenant, which even the ungodly did not venture openly to reject.
   The Messiah must be born; and this was expected by all, because the
   salvation of the whole nation depended on it. The Prophet, therefore,
   after having expressed his indignation against the king, again argues
   in this manner: "By rejecting the promise, thou wouldest endeavor to
   overturn the decree of God; but it shall remain inviolable, and thy
   treachery and ingratitude will not hinder God from being, continually
   the Deliverer of his people; for he will at length raise up his
   Messiah."

   To make these things more plain, we must attend to the custom of the
   Prophets, who, in establishing special promises, lay down this as the
   foundation, that God will send a Redeemer. On this general foundation
   God everywhere builds all the special promises which he makes to his
   people; and certainly every one who expects aid and assistance from him
   must be convinced of his fatherly love. And how could he be reconciled
   to us but through Christ, in whom he has freely adopted the elect, and
   continues to pardon them to the end? Hence comes that saying of Paul,
   that

   all the promises of God in Christ are Yea and Amen.
   (2 Corinthians 1:20.)

   Whenever, therefore, God assisted his ancient people, he at the same
   time reconciled them to himself through Christ; and accordingly,
   whenever famine, pestilence, and war are mentioned, in order to hold
   out a hope of deliverance, he places the Messiah before their eyes.
   This being exceedingly clear, the Jews have no right to make a noise,
   as if the Prophet made an unseasonable transition to a very remote
   subject. For on what did the deliverance of Jerusalem depend, but on
   the manifestation of Christ? This was, indeed, the only foundation on
   which the salvation of the Church always rested.

   Most appropriately, therefore, did Isaiah say, "True, thou dost not
   believe the promises of God, but yet God will fulfill them; for he will
   at length send his Christ, for whose sake he determines to preserve
   this city. Though thou art unworthy, yet God will have regard to his
   own honor." King Ahaz is therefore deprived of that sign which he
   formerly rejected, and loses the benefit of which he proved himself to
   be unworthy; but still God's inviolable promise is still held out to
   him. This is plainly enough intimated by the particle lkn, (lachen,)
   therefore; that is, because thou disdainest that particular sign which
   God offered to thee, hv', (hu,) He, that is, God himself, who was so
   gracious as to offer it freely to thee, he whom thou weariest will not
   fail to hold out a sign. When I say that the coming of Christ is
   promised to Ahaz, I do not mean that God includes him among the chosen
   people, to whom he had appointed his Son to be the Author of salvation;
   but because the discourse is directed to the whole body of the people.

   Will give you a sign. The word lkm, (lachem,) to you, is interpreted by
   some as meaning to your children; but this is forced. So far as relates
   to the persons addressed, the Prophet leaves the wicked king and looks
   to the nation, so far as it had been adopted by God. He will therefore
   give, not to thee a wicked king, and to those who are like thee, but to
   you whom he has adopted; for the covenant which he made with Abraham
   continues to be firm and inviolable. And the Lord always has some
   remnant to whom the advantage of the covenant belongs; though the
   rulers and governors of his people may be hypocrites.

   Behold, a virgin shall conceive. The word Behold is used emphatically,
   to denote the greatness of the event; for this is the manner in which
   the Spirit usually speaks of great and remarkable events, in order to
   elevate the minds of men. The Prophet, therefore, enjoins his hearers
   to be attentive, and to consider this extraordinary work of God; as if
   he had said, "Be not slothful, but consider this singular grace of God,
   which ought of itself to have drawn your attention, but is concealed
   from you on account of your stupidity."

   Although the word lmh, (gnalmah,) a virgin, is derived from lm,
   (gnalam,) which signifies to hide, because the shame and modesty of
   virgins does not allow them to appear in public; yet as the Jews
   dispute much about that word, and assert that it does not signify
   virgin, because Solomon used it to denote a young woman who was
   betrothed, it is unnecessary to contend about the word. Though we
   should admit what they say, that lmh (gnalmah) sometimes denotes a
   young woman, and that the name refers, as they would have it, to the
   age, (yet it is frequently used in Scripture when the subject relates
   to a virgin,) the nature of the case sufficiently refutes all their
   slanders. For what wonderful thing did the Prophet say, if he spoke of
   a young woman who conceived through intercourse with a man? It would
   certainly have been absurd to hold out this as a sign or a miracle. Let
   us suppose that it denotes a young woman who should become pregnant in
   the ordinary course of nature; [109] everybody sees that it would have
   been silly and contemptible for the Prophet, after having said that he
   was about to speak of something strange and uncommon, to add, A young
   woman shall conceive. It is, therefore, plain enough that he speaks of
   a virgin who should conceive, not by the ordinary course of nature, but
   by the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit. And this is the mystery
   which Paul extols in lofty terms, that

   God was manifested in the flesh. (1 Timothy 3:16.)

   And shall call. The Hebrew verb is in the feminine gender, She shall
   call; for as to those who read it in the masculine gender, I know not
   on what they found their opinion. The copies which we use certainly do
   not differ. If you apply it to the mother, it certainly expresses
   something different from the ordinary custom. We know that to the
   father is always assigned the right of giving a name to a child; for it
   is a sign of the power and authority of fathers over children; and the
   same authority does not belong to women. But here it is conveyed to the
   mother; and therefore it follows that he is conceived by the mother in
   such a manner as not to have a father on earth; otherwise the Prophet
   would pervert the ordinary custom of Scripture, which ascribes this
   office to men only. Yet it ought to be observed that the name was not
   given to Christ at the suggestion of his mother, and in such a case it
   would have had no weight; but the Prophet means that, in publishing the
   name, the virgin will occupy the place of a herald, because there will
   be no earthly father to perform that office.

   Immanuel. This name was unquestionably bestowed on Christ on account of
   the actual fact; for the only-begotten Son of God clothed himself with
   our flesh, and united himself to us by partaking of our nature. He is,
   therefore, called God with us, or united to us; which cannot apply to a
   man who is not God. The Jews in their sophistry tell us that this name
   was given to Hezekiah; because by the hand of Hezekiah God delivered
   his people; and they add, "He who is the servant of God represents his
   person." But neither Moses nor Joshua, who were deliverers of the
   nation, were so denominated; and therefore this Immanuel is preferred
   to Moses and Joshua, and all the others; for by this name he excels all
   that ever were before, and all that shall come after him; and it is a
   title expressive of some extraordinary excellence and authority which
   he possesses above others. It is therefore evident that it denotes not
   only the power of God, such as he usually displays by his servant, but
   a union of person, by which Christ became God-man. Hence it is also
   evident that Isaiah here relates no common event, but points out that
   unparalleled mystery which the Jews labor in vain to conceal.

   15. Butter and honey shall he eat. Here the Prophet proves the true
   human nature of Christ; for it was altogether incredible that he who
   was God should be born of a virgin. Such a prodigy was revolting to the
   ordinary judgment of men. To hinder us from thinking that his fancy now
   presents to us some apparition, he describes the marks of human nature,
   in order to show, by means of them, that Christ will actually appear in
   flesh, or in the nature of man; that is, that he will be reared in the
   same manner that children commonly are. The Jews had a different way of
   rearing children from what is followed by us; for they used honey,
   which is not so customary among us; and to this day they still retain
   the custom of causing a child to taste butter and honey, as soon as it
   is born, before receiving suck.

   That he may know. That is, until he arrive at that age when he can
   distinguish between good and evil, or, as we commonly say, till the
   years of discretion; l (lamed) denotes the term and period up to which
   he shall be reared after the manner of a child; and this contributes
   still more to prove the reality of his nature. He therefore means
   understanding and judgment, such as is obtained when the period of
   childhood is past. Thus we see how far the Son of God condescended on
   our account, so that he not only was willing to be fed on our food, but
   also, for a time, to be deprived of understanding, and to endure all
   our weaknesses. (Hebrews 2:14.) This relates to his human nature, for
   it cannot apply to his Divinity. Of this state of ignorance, in which
   Christ was for a time, Luke testifies when he says,

   And he grew in wisdom, and in stature,
   and in favor with God and with man. (Luke 2:52.)

   If Luke had merely said that Christ grew, he might have been supposed
   to mean with men; but he expressly adds, with God. Christ must
   therefore have been, for a time, like little children, so that, so far
   as relates to his human nature, he was deficient in understanding.

   16. Before the child shall know. Many have been led into a mistake by
   connecting this verse with the preceding one, as if it had been the
   same child that was mentioned. They suppose that it assigns the reason,
   and that the particle ky (ki) means for [110] But if we carefully
   examine the Prophet's meaning, it will quickly be apparent that he
   leaves the general doctrine, to which he had made a short digression,
   and returns to his immediate subject. After having founded the hope of
   the preservation of the city on the promised Mediator, he now shows in
   what way it will be preserved.

   The child. I interpret this word as referring, not to Christ, but to
   all children in general. Here I differ from all the commentators; for
   they think that the demonstrative h points out a particular child. But
   I view hnr, (hannagnar,) so that h is indeed added for the purpose of
   making it more definite, but is intended to point out the age, and not
   any particular child; as when we say, The child, [111] and add the
   article The [112] for the purpose of giving greater definiteness. This
   is very customary in Scripture. If he had pointed out a particular
   child, he would have added hzh, (hazzeh,) as is frequently done in
   other passages. It is not probable that this promise of the overturn of
   the kingdoms of Syria and Samaria, which immediately followed, would be
   deferred for five hundred years, that is, till the coming of Christ;
   and, indeed, it would have been altogether absurd. The meaning
   therefore is, "Before the children, who shall be born hereafter, can
   distinguish between good and evil, the land which thou hatest shall be
   forsaken."

   The land. By the land I understand Israel and Syria; for though they
   were two, yet on account of the league which had been formed between
   the two kings, they are accounted one. Some understand by it Judea; but
   that cannot agree on account of the plural noun which follows, her
   kings. That these things happened as they are written may be easily
   inferred from the sacred history; for when Ahaz called the Assyrians to
   aid him, Rezin was slain by them. (2 Kings 16:9.) Not long afterwards,
   Pekah, king of Israel, died, in the twelfth year of King Ahaz, and was
   succeeded by Hoshea, the son of Elah. (2 Kings 15:30; 17:1.) Thus,
   before the children who should afterwards be born were grown up, both
   countries would be deprived of their kings; for before that time both
   Rezin and Pekah were removed out of the land of the living. Now the
   discourse is addressed to Ahaz, and God promises to him, by way of
   consolation, that he will inflict punishment on the enemies of Ahaz,
   but for no other purpose than to render him more inexcusable.

   Which thou hatest. As to the word hatest, Syria and the land of Israel
   are said to be hated or abhorred by King Ahaz, because from that
   quarter he was attacked by invading armies. He therefore promises that
   those kings will soon perish. Some render mphny, (mippenei,) on account
   of; [113] and I admit that this word is generally used in this sense.
   But I adopt here a more natural rendering, as if he had said, It shall
   be forsaken from the face or from the presence of the two kings, and
   shall be left by them, so that they shall no more be seen. And by these
   words it is sufficiently evident that this must be understood as
   referring to both kingdoms.

   17. The Lord shall bring upon thee. Here the Prophet, on the other
   hand, threatens the wicked hypocrite, who pretended that he was
   unwilling to tempt God, and yet called for those whom the Lord had
   forbidden him to call to his aid. (Exodus 23:32.) That he might not
   indulge in undue exultation and insolence on account of the former
   promise, he likewise threatens his destruction, and declares that what
   he hopes to be his preservation, that is, the aid of the Assyrians,
   will be utterly destructive to him. (2 Kings 16:7; 2 Chronicles 28:16.)
   As if he had said, "Thou promisest everything to thyself from the king
   of Assyria, and thinkest that he will be faithful to thee, because thou
   hast entered into a league and covenant with him, which God had
   forbidden; but thou shalt quickly understand of what advantage it will
   be to thee to have tempted God. Thou mightest have remained at home and
   at ease, and mightest have received the assistance of God; but thou
   choosest rather to call in the Assyrians. Thou shalt find them to be
   worse than thine own enemies;"

   This discourse, therefore, agrees with what goes before; for he presses
   more closely the treachery and ingratitude of the king, who had
   rejected both the word of God and the sign, and had rendered himself
   unworthy of every promise. And as it is customary with hypocrites, when
   they have escaped from any danger and fear, immediately to return to
   their natural disposition, he affirms that nothing shall protect the
   Jews from being likewise involved in just punishments. He expressly
   declares that the family of David, which might have claimed exemption
   on the ground of its peculiar privilege, will be exposed to the same
   kind of calamities; for God regulates his judgments in such a manner,
   that while he spares his Church and provides for her permanent
   existence, he does not permit the wicked, who are mingled with the
   good, to escape unpunished.

   From the day that Ephraim departed from Judah. In this manner does
   Scripture speak when it describes any serious calamity; for the Jews
   could not have received a severer chastisement than when, by the
   withdrawing of the ten tribes, (1 Kings 12:16,) not only was the
   kingdom wretchedly divided, but the body of the nation was rent and
   torn. The revolt of Ephraim from Judah was, therefore, an indication of
   the worst kind of calamity; for the resources of the kingdom of Judah
   being more seriously affected by that division than it could have been
   by any defeat by a foreign enemy, he says that since that time the Jews
   had not sustained a greater calamity.

   Hence, as I have already said, we see how God, while he punishes
   hypocrites, at the same time remembers believers, and opens the way for
   his mercy. We ought to observe this wonderful arrangement, that amidst
   the most dreadful deaths still the Church remains safe. Who would ever
   have thought that Jerusalem would be delivered from the vast army of
   the two kings? Or, that the kingdom of Syria, which was then in a
   flourishing condition, would quickly be overturned? Or, that Samaria
   was not far from destruction? And in the mean time, that the Assyrians,
   on whom the Jews relied, would do them more injury than the Israelites
   and Syrians had ever done? All these things the Lord did for the sake
   of preserving his Church, but at the same time in such a manner that he
   likewise took vengeance on the wickedness of King Ahaz.

   18. And it shall be in that day. The Jews thought that the Assyrians
   were bound by their league with them; but the Prophet ridicules this
   folly, and declares that they will be ready at God's bidding to drive
   them in any direction that he thinks fit. Yet instead of command he
   employs the metaphor hiss, in allusion to the climate of those kingdoms
   of which he speaks; for Egypt abounds in flies, because the country is
   hot and marshy; and when the air is both hot and moist, there must be
   produced a great abundance of flies. Assyria, on the other hand,
   abounded in bees; and when he says that he will bring them by a hiss,
   he alludes to the natural habits of bees and flies, but he means that
   he will find no difficulty in sending them. As if he had said, "There
   will be no need of great exertion; for as soon as I shall give the
   sign, they will instantly run." In this manner he shows what efficacy
   belongs to his secret operation or design, that by a hiss he compels
   the most powerful nations to yield obedience.

   19. And they shall come. He follows out the same metaphor; for bees
   commonly seek nests for themselves in caverns, or valleys and bushes,
   and such like places; as if he had said that there would not be a
   corner in which the enemy would not settle down and dwell. It is
   unnecessary to give ourselves much trouble in explaining why he speaks
   of bushes and thorns rather than of other things, for the language is
   figurative. And yet I have no doubt that he intended to state, that
   whether they hide themselves in caverns, or seek concealment in
   valleys, there will be no escape; for the enemy will take possession of
   the whole country.

   Hence we again infer what has been formerly observed, that nothing
   takes place at random or by chance, but that everything is governed by
   the hand of God. Again, though wicked men may rage and may be hurried
   forward in blind attack, still God puts a bridle on them that they may
   promote his glory. Therefore, when we see that wicked men throw
   everything into disorder, let us not think that God has laid the bridle
   on their neck, that they may rush forward wherever they please; but let
   us be fully convinced that their violent attacks are under control.
   From this we ought to derive wonderful consolation amidst those
   disturbances in which the Christian world is so deeply involved, and by
   the violence of which it is so powerfully shaken, that almost
   everything appears to be in a state of confusion. We should consider
   that the Lord has a concealed bridle by which he restrains furious
   beasts, so that they cannot break through wherever the madness of their
   rage drives them, or go beyond the limits which the Lord prescribes to
   them.

   20. The Lord will shave with a hired razor. He now employs a different
   metaphor, and compares those enemies by whom the Lord had determined to
   afflict Judea at the appointed time, to a razor, by which the beard and
   hair are shaved, and other excrescences of the same kind are removed. v
   (beth) is here superfluous, and is only employed in accordance with the
   Hebrew idiom, to denote an instrument, and, therefore, I have merely
   rendered it he will shave with a razor. What he means he immediately
   explains; namely, that the Assyrians will serve for a razor in the hand
   of God, and that they will come from a distant country.

   Who are beyond the river. This means that Euphrates will not hinder
   them from passing over to execute the commands of God. He likewise
   adds, that it will not be some portion of that nation rushing forward
   of its own accord into foreign territories, or wandering without a
   settled leader; but that the king himself will lead them, so that the
   nation and the king at the same time will overwhelm Judea, and it will
   sink under such a burden.

   A hired razor. It is not without reason that he says that this razor is
   hired; for he expresses by it the dreadful nature of the calamity which
   would be brought upon them by the Assyrians. If a man make use of a
   hired horse or a hired sword, he will use it the more freely, and will
   not spare or take care of it as he would do with his own, for men wish
   to gain advantage from what they have hired to the full value of the
   hire. Thus the Lord threatens that he will not at all spare the razor,
   though he should be under the necessity of blunting it, which means,
   that he will send the Assyrians with mad violence and rage. If the Lord
   took such dreadful vengeance on the Jews for those reasons which the
   Prophet formerly enumerated, we ought to fear lest we be punished in
   the same manner; or rather, we ought to dread the razor with which he
   has already begun to shave us.

   The head and the hair of the feet. By the hair of the feet he means the
   lower parts; for by the feet is meant all that is below the belly, and
   it is a figure of speech, by which a part is taken for the whole. [114]
   In short, he means that the whole body, and even the beard, must be
   shaved. Now, if we set aside the figures, and wish to get at the plain
   and natural meaning, it is as if he had said, that this shaving will
   reach from the top of the head down to the feet, and that kings and
   princes will not be exempted from that calamity, but that they also
   must feel the edge of the razor

   21. And it shall come to pass on that day. In these verses, down to the
   end of the chapter, the Prophet describes the state of a country torn
   and wasted; for he intends to present a striking and lively picture of
   such overwhelming distress that, wherever you turn your eyes, nothing
   is to be seen but the traces of frightful desolation. Some think that a
   mitigation of punishment is here promised, but we shall soon see that
   this does not agree with the context. Though he employs the
   appellation, a man, without any limitation, yet strictly it is of the
   richest men that he speaks; for he does not say that every one will
   have so many; but they who formerly were accustomed to rear a large
   number of oxen and sheep will be satisfied with having a few. He means,
   therefore, that all will be reduced to very deep poverty. Some think
   that the Hebrew word which the Prophet employs, ychyh, (yechaiyeh,) he
   shall quicken, means "to deliver from death;" but the meaning which I
   have adopted is more natural and more generally approved.

   22. On account of the abundance of milk. Some explain it thus: "there
   will scarcely be as much obtained from one cow as would be required for
   the food of a family;" for those who rear cattle do not feed on milk
   alone, but likewise make cheeses, and have butter to sell. When,
   therefore, he says, that out of all their abundance nothing more would
   be produced than what was necessary for the use of the family, in the
   opinion of those commentators it denotes poverty. Others think that
   this is a promise of fertility, that however small may be the number of
   their cows and sheep, still they will have abundant means of support. A
   third exposition is preferable; for it appears as if the Prophet
   intended to show that the men will be so few in number that a small
   quantity of milk will be sufficient for them all; and it is a far
   heavier affliction that a country should want inhabitants than that it
   should have a small supply of herds and flocks.

   In the preceding verse Isaiah declared, that Judea would be so
   impoverished, that very few herds and flocks would be left; but now he
   adds that the men will be still fewer, for a very little milk will be
   sufficient for the inhabitants of the land. I adopt this exposition the
   more readily, because here a promise would be inappropriate. The former
   sense is forced; and he does not speak only of cattle-feeders who had
   cows, but of all the inhabitants; for he expressly says, Every one that
   shall be left, and by that expression he again denotes the smallness of
   their number. His statement, therefore, is intended to show, that the
   country will be so generally forsaken and so miserably wasted, that no
   great supply of milk and butter will be needed; for, when the
   devastation has taken place, there will be few men left.

   23. A thousand vines. As to the opinion of those who think that Isaiah
   here comforts believers, I pass it by without refutation; for it is
   sufficiently refuted by the context, and the words plainly declare that
   Isaiah continues to threaten destruction, and to describe the
   desolation of the land. Others think that the meaning is this, "Where a
   thousand vines were, which were sold for a thousand pieces of silver,
   there briers and thorns will be found." But it is plain that this would
   be far too low a price, if the statement were applied to the whole
   country; for who would think of reckoning a shekel to be the price of a
   vine, which is the most precious of all possessions? It is of the same
   import with a common expression, "to sell for a trifle," to give away
   for a piece of bread; [115] when anything is sold at a very low price.
   Any field, however barren or uncultivated, might be sold at a higher
   price, if due attention were paid to the cultivation of land, as is
   usually done where there is a crowded population.

   On account of briers and thorns. He assigns a reason for the alteration
   of the price, which makes it evident that he speaks of desolation. On
   account of briers and thorns, says he; for there will be none to
   cultivate the land, which usually happens when a heavy calamity has
   been sustained. l, (lamed,) which some render to or for, means, I
   think, on account of; for, everything having been thrown into confusion
   by the fury of the invading army, there are no vinedressers or
   laborers, and the most highly cultivated lands must have been covered
   over and choked up by briers and thorns. The meaning therefore is, that
   the inhabitants will be so few, that you will scarcely find and one
   that would give the smallest coin to buy the most valuable estates.

   24. With arrows and bow shall they come thither. The verb yv', (yabo,)
   he shall come, is in the singular number; but it ought to be explained
   by the plural, that the archers will march through Judea. Some think
   that Isaiah speaks of bows and arrows, because such would be the dread
   of enemies, that no man unarmed would venture to approach his
   possessions. But I consider it to be more probable that the Prophet
   means that, where the richest cultivation formerly existed, opportunity
   for hunting will be found; for there the wild beasts have their dens.
   Now, it is a most wretched change, when fields formerly cultivated and
   fertile are turned into woods and thickets. By bow and arrow here,
   therefore, I understand hunting, in this sense: "it shall not be
   approached by husbandmen but by hunters, and they shall not plant or
   dress vines, but chase wild beasts." In short, it means nothing else
   than frightful desolation, which shall change the aspect of the land.

   25. And on all the hills that are dug with the hoe. Here the Prophet
   appears to contradict himself; for, having hitherto spoken of the
   desolation of the land, he now describes what may be called a new
   condition, when he says that, where thorns and briers were, there oxen
   will feed. The consequence has been, that some have applied these words
   to the consolation of the people. But the intention of the Prophet is
   totally different; for he means that hills, which were at a great
   distance from a crowded population, and which could not be approached
   without much difficulty, will be fit for pasturage, on account of the
   great number of men who go thither; that is, because men will betake
   themselves to desert mountains, which formerly were inaccessible, there
   will be no need to be afraid of briers, [116] for there will be
   abundance of inhabitants. Now, this is a most wretched state of things,
   when men cannot escape death but by resorting to thorns and briers; for
   he means hills formerly desolate and uncultivated, in which men shall
   seek a residence and abode, because no part of the country will be
   safe. Thus he describes a distressful and melancholy condition of the
   whole country, and destruction so awful that the aspect of the country
   shall be altogether different from what it had formerly been.

   When he foretold these things to King Ahaz, there can be no doubt that
   Ahaz despised them; for that wicked king, relying on his forces and on
   his league with the Assyrians, settled, as it were, on his lees, as
   soon as the siege of the city was raised. But Isaiah was bound to
   persevere in the discharge of his office, in order to show that there
   was no help but from God, and to inform the wretched hypocrite, that
   his destruction would come from that quarter from which he expected his
   preservation.

   Isaiah Chapter 8:1-22

   1. Moreover, the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write
   in it with a man's pen concerning Mahar-shalal-hash-baz.

   1. Et dixit Iehova ad me: Sume tibi volumen grande, et scribi in eo
   stylo vulgari, (vel, hominis:) Accelera ad diripiendum, festina ad
   praedam.

   2. And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest,
   and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

   2. Et adhibui mihi testes fideles, Uriam sacerdotem, et Zachariam
   filium Iebarachiae.

   3. And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son:
   then said the Lord to me, Call his name Mahar-shalal-hash-baz:

   3. Et accessi ad prophetissam, quae concepit, et peperit filium.
   Dixitque mihi Iehova: Voca nomen ejus, Accelera ad diripiendum; festina
   ad praedam.

   4. For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my
   mother, the riches of Damascus, and the spoil of Samaria, shall be
   taken away before the king of Assyria.

   4. Sane antequam sciat puer clamare, Pater mi et mater mea, tolletur
   substantia Damasci, et spolia Samariae, coram Rege Assyriae.

   5. The Lord spake also unto me again, saying,

   5. Rursus loquutus est mecum Iehova, iterum dicens:

   6. Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go
   softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

   6. Quandoquidem rejecit populus iste aquas Siloe, quae fluunt cum
   silentio, et gaudium fuit illi ad Rezin, et filium Romeliae.

   7. Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of
   the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his
   glory; and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his
   banks.

   7. Ideo, ecce Dominus adducit super eos aquas fluvii, violentas et
   magnas: nempe Regem Assyriae et omne robur ejus; ascendetque super
   omnes rivos, et transibit super omnes ripas ejus.

   8. And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over; he
   shall reach even to the neck: and the stretching out of his wings shall
   fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

   8. Et trajiciens in Iudam inundabit, et transibit, pertinget usque ad
   collum. Et implebit extensio alarum ejus latitudinem terrae tuae, O
   Immanuel.

   9. Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces;
   and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be
   broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.

   9. Consociate vos populi, et confringemini; auribus percipite quotquot
   e longinqua terra estis. Accingite vos, et confringemini; accingite,
   inquam, vos, et confringemini.

   10. Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word,
   and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

   10. Consultate consilium, et dissolvetur; decernite decretum, et non
   stabit; quia nobiscum Deus. (Hebraice, Immanuel.)

   11. For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed
   me, that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying,

   11. Nam sic dixit mihi Iehova, tanquam apprehensione (vel, roboratione)
   manus; et erudivit me, ne irem per viam populi hujus, dicens:

   12. Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall
   say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.

   12. Ne dicatis, Conspiratio, in quibuscunque populus iste dicit,
   Conspiratio, neque timorem eorum timueritis, aut formidaveritis.

   13. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and
   let him be your dread.

   13. Iehovam exercituum ipsum sanctificate; et sit ipse timor vester; et
   idem sit pavor vester.

   14. And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and
   for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel; for a gin and for
   a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

   14. Tum ipse erit in sanctuarium; in lapidem offendiculi; et in petram
   ruinae, duabus domibus Israel; in laqueum, et tendiculum incolae
   Ierusalem.

   15. And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be
   snared, and be taken.

   15. Et impingent multi inter eos; ideoque corruent, et conterentur,
   irretientur, et capientur.

   16. Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

   16. Liga contestationem; obsigna legem inter discipulos meos.

   17. And I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house
   of Jacob, and I will look for him.

   17. Itaque expectabo Iehovam, qui abscondit faciem suam a domo Iacob,
   et praestolabor eum.

   18. Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for
   signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth
   in mount Zion.

   18. Ecce ego et pueri, quos dedit mihi Iehova, in signa et prodigia in
   Israel; a Iehova exercituum, qui habitat in monte Sion.

   19. And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar
   spirits, and unto wizards that peep and that mutter: should not a
   people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?

   19. Quod si dixerint vobis, Sciscitamini a pythonicis et divinis, qui
   mussitant et demurmurant; annon populus Deum suum consulet, a vivis ad
   mortuos?

   20. To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to
   this word, it is because there is no light in them.

   20. Ad legem et testimonium. Si non loquuti fuerint secundum verbum
   hoc, ideo nempe quod nihil est lucis.

   21. And they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry: and it
   shall come to pass, that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret
   themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward.

   21. Tum per hanc terram transibunt oppressi et famelici. Et accidet ut
   cum esurierint, irritentur, ac maledicant regi suo, Deo suo,
   attollentes sursum faciem.

   22. And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
   darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to darkness.

   22. Et quum spectaverit ad terram, ecce tribulatio et tenebrae, caligo,
   angustia, et ad obscuritatem impulsus.


   1. And Jehovah said to me. [117] This prophecy contains nothing new,
   but is a confirmation of the preceding one, in which Isaiah predicted
   the approaching desolation of the kingdom of Israel and Syria. He had
   foretold that both countries would be deprived of their kings, before
   the children who should soon afterwards be born could distinguish
   between good and evil, that is, before they were grown up. (Isaiah
   7:16.) But because the wicked are not terrified by any threatenings, it
   was therefore necessary that this prediction should be repeated and
   demonstrated by some outward sign.

   First, in order more effectually to arouse the nation, God commands
   that this prophecy be made publicly known by writing, that it may be
   understood by all. We have formerly said, [118] that it was the custom
   of the Prophets, after having been enjoined to deliver any message to
   the people, to sum up in a few words the substance of what they had
   said, and to affix it to the gates of the temple; as may be learned
   from Habakkuk 2:2; for if that passage be compared with the present,
   the matter will be sufficiently obvious. But here something peculiar is
   expressed; for God does not merely command him to write the prophecy,
   but demands a great and large roll, in order that it may be read at a
   distance. The smaller the writing is, it is the more obscure, and can
   with greater difficulty be read. To the same purpose is what
   immediately follows, with the pen of a common man, [119] for 'ns
   (enosh) denotes any man of ordinary rank; and the meaning is, that not
   even the most ignorant and uneducated persons may be unable to read the
   writing.

   Make speed to spoil, hasten to the prey. [120] This concise brevity is
   more emphatic than if he had made a long discourse; for any one could
   carry home four words, and perceive in them the swiftness of the wrath
   of God, and be truly and deeply affected by the judgment of God, as if
   it had been pointed out with the finger. In short, God determined that
   he should not waste words, because there was no time for controversy,
   but that he should represent the matter by an outward sign. The
   Prophets having so frequently, and without any good effect, threatened
   vengeance, he gave a striking exhibition of it by an example, that it
   might make a deeper impression on their minds, and be engraven on their
   memory. As often as these words mhr sll hs vz (Maher-shalal-hash-baz)
   were mentioned, they would recall to their remembrance the destruction
   of Israel and Syria, and would make them more certain of it.

   Isaiah having prophesied about the coming of Christ in the former
   chapter, (Isaiah 7:14,) many improperly explain this also as relating
   to the same subject, that, endued with heavenly power, he came to spoil
   the prince of this world, (John 12:31,) and therefore hastened to the
   prey. This ingenuity is pleasing enough, but cannot at all harmonize
   with the text; for the true and natural view of the context shows that
   in this passage the Prophet brings forward nothing that is new, but
   supports what he had formerly said.

   2. And I took into me witnesses. The noun dym, (gnedim,) and the verb
   'yd, (agnid,) which the Prophet employs, are derived from the same
   root, and the allusion is elegant, as if we were to say, "I have
   called-to-witness witnesses." [121] As this was a matter of great
   importance, he therefore took to himself witnesses, as is usually done
   on important occasions.

   Faithful witnesses. He calls them faithful, that is, true and worthy of
   credit; and yet one of them was an ungodly and worthless apostate, who,
   wishing to flatter his king, erected an altar resembling the altar at
   Damascus, and openly defended ungodliness and unlawful modes of
   worship. Some commentators, I am aware, are of opinion that it was a
   different person; but a careful examination of the circumstances will
   convince any one, that this was the same Urijah, of whom the sacred
   history declares that he was slavishly devoted to the ungodliness and
   lawless desires of the king. (2 Kings 16:11.) As to those who think
   that it was a different person, because Isaiah here calls this man
   faithful, such an argument carries little weight; for the Prophet did
   not look at the man, but at the office which he held, and which
   rendered him a fit person for bearing testimony. Accordingly, he does
   not mean that he was a good and excellent man, but that his office gave
   him such influence that nobody could reject him, and that his testimony
   was, as they say, free from every objection.

   Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. I think that
   this prophecy was affixed to the gates of the temple, Uriah and
   Zechariah having been taken to be witnesses; for he does not speak of a
   vision, but of a command of God, which he actually obeyed, in order
   that these words, like a common proverb, might be repeated by every
   person.

   3. And I approached to the prophetess. What follows happened to the
   Prophet, I have no doubt, by a vision, for the purpose of sealing the
   former prediction. The vision given to Isaiah was, that he had a child
   by his wife, and was enjoined to give him this name. There would,
   indeed, be no absurdity in admitting that the Prophet actually had a
   son by his wife, and gave him this name; and I shall not eagerly
   dispute with any one who is of that opinion. But as it is not probable
   that this name was given to any man, and as there is no evidence to
   prove it, I am more disposed to think that this was a vision exhibited
   to the Prophet, in order to confirm the former prediction. He calls his
   wife a prophetess, not in the same sense in which the wives of kings,
   for the sake of showing them respect, are called queens, but because in
   this vision she sustained a public character. [122]

   4. Truly before the child have knowledge to cry. This is an
   interpretation both of the dark saying and of the vision which was
   added to it; for although God did not intend to speak in direct
   language, still it was proper that obscurity should be removed. I
   interpret hnr, (hannagnar,) the child, to mean not the Prophet's son,
   but rather all who should be born soon afterwards. He declares that,
   before they are grown up, the two kings of Israel and Samaria [123]
   will be destroyed.

   Before the face of the king of Assyria. That is, at the disposal, or at
   the will, of the king of Assyria; alluding perhaps to an ancient custom
   of carrying the spoils of the enemies before the chariot of those who
   received a public triumph. In like manner shall the spoils of Samaria
   and Damascus be carried before the king of Assyria.

   This makes it still more evident that the Prophet intended nothing else
   than to foretell the desolation of the kingdom of Israel and of Syria.
   He does this for the purpose of comforting the godly, and likewise of
   holding up to scorn the foolish dread of the wicked king, who could not
   endure that the Lord should assist him; for he rejected not only the
   promises, but likewise the sign which was offered. In consequence of
   this, the Prophet goes farther and farther in reproving his wickedness,
   and that of the whole nation. "Thou dost, indeed, believe nothing, but
   the Lord will assist his own; and thou shalt quickly see sudden and
   unexpected changes, by which the Lord will deliver his people." And yet
   these words were spoken not so much to the king as to godly men; and
   hence we ought to infer that the servants of God do not always speak so
   as to be believed by their hearers; for Isaiah here addresses wicked
   men, in whom he produces no conviction. Why, then, does he speak to
   them? To convict them more and more of their unbelief, and to reprove
   them for it; and next, to render the goodness of God more manifest: for
   who would not have thought that such aggravated wickedness would
   entirely shut the door against the mercy of God? And yet the Lord, by
   his goodness, rises superior to the wickedness both of the king and of
   the people. The object of the Prophet therefore is, to reprove the
   ungodly for their rebelliousness, and at the same time show that God is
   always like himself.

   6. Because this people hath despised (or, disdained [124] ) the waters
   of Shiloah That Ahaz may not slumber in unfounded expectation, the
   Prophet all at once breaks off his discourse about the general safety
   of the godly, and next threatens punishment on unbelievers. Some think
   that he speaks against those who wished for revolutions; as it
   frequently happens that the multitude are not satisfied with their
   present condition, and desire to have a new king. Those who are
   diseased often expect that, by a change of place, they will be in
   better health. So perverse is the will of men, that when matters do not
   go to their wish, they look for a change of their condition, snatch at
   it eagerly, and hope to obtain from it some relief.

   But I think that the Prophet's meaning is more extensive, and does not
   apply to those only who desired a change; but that the discourse is
   general, and includes all ranks; for impiety and contempt of God almost
   universally prevailed, and he does not speak of a few persons, or of a
   particular party, but of the great body of the nation. I confess,
   indeed, that he excepts a few persons, servants of God, who will
   afterwards be mentioned; but that does not prevent the remonstrances of
   Isaiah from being directed against the whole nation; for since almost
   all were corrupted, he justly reproves them all. The offense is, that
   the people, distrusting their own weakness, sought increased wealth and
   increased forces. He says, therefore, that they despised the waters of
   Shiloah, because the Jews despised and disdained their condition.

   And their joy was to Rezin and Remaliah's son. [125] Some render it
   with Rezin, but the preposition to expresses more fully the perverse
   desire. He means that the Jews, perceiving that they had not strong
   fortresses, looked in another direction, and longed for the wealth of
   the kingdom of Israel. Beholding their small number and their poverty,
   they trembled, and placed no confidence in God, but only in outward
   assistance, and thought that they would be perfectly safe, if they had
   as powerful a king as the Israelites had. Thus they rejoiced in the
   riches of others, and in longing for them.

   7. Therefore, behold. He speaks in the present tense, that all may
   attend more closely: Behold, the Lord bringeth violent waters. We must
   attend to the metaphors which the Prophet employs, for the style is
   much more elegant than if it had been naked and unadorned. "It is as if
   he had said, Because the people are not satisfied with their condition,
   and desire the riches of others, I will show them what it is to have a
   powerful king." For instance, if a small nation, whose king was mean
   and little esteemed, had powerful neighbors over whom an illustrious
   king reigned, and said, "How delightful would it be to serve that
   prosperous king, to be the subjects of the emperor, or of the kings of
   France; for their power is irresistible!" would not God justly punish
   such an unlawful desire? The more powerful that kings are, the more
   grievously do they oppress their people; there is nothing which they
   will not attempt, they do everything according to their caprice.
   Besides, they know no limit to their power, and in proportion to their
   strength they indulge with less restraint. The Lord reproves that mad
   desire of the Jews, in not being satisfied with their condition, and in
   looking, not to the Lord, but to the resources of powerful kings; and
   this reproof is far more graceful under these metaphors than if he had
   spoken in plain and direct language.

   Shiloah, as Jerome tells us, was a small fountain, from which flowed a
   little river that ran gently through the midst of Jerusalem. That
   narrow river yielding them little protection, they therefore distrusted
   it, and desired to have those great rivers by which cities are usually
   defended and greatly enriched; for there is nothing by which a country
   is more enlarged or more rapidly enriched, than by those large and
   navigable rivers, which render it easy to import and export merchandise
   of every description. He therefore compares Euphrates, which was the
   most celebrated river in all the East, to Shiloah, and pursues the same
   metaphor, meaning by those rapid waters of the river the Assyrians, who
   would destroy the whole of Judea, and would waste it like a deluge. (2
   Kings 18:13, 17.) "I will show," saith the Lord, "what it is to desire
   those rapid and violent waters."

   And he shall come up. This passage ought to be carefully observed; for
   we all have a distrust that may be called natural to us, so that, when
   we see ourselves deprived of human assistance, we lose courage.
   Whatever God may promise, we cannot at all recover ourselves, but keep
   our eyes fixed on our nakedness, and sit like bewildered persons in our
   fear; and therefore we ought to seek a cure for this fault. Shiloah,
   therefore, that is, the calling or lot which God has assigned to us
   accompanied by a promise, though we do not see it with our eyes, ought
   to be our defense, and we should prefer it to the highest power of all
   the kings in the world. For if we rely on human aid, and place our
   strength in large forces and abundance of wealth, we must look for the
   punishment which is here threatened by the Prophet.

   The sacred history assures us that these things were fulfilled, so that
   any one who shall read the history will not need a lengthened
   exposition of this passage; for the Assyrians, whom the Jews called to
   their assistance, destroyed them. This was the just punishment of their
   distrust; and we see in it a striking instance of the wicked greediness
   of men, who cannot be satisfied with the promise and assistance of God.

   From this destruction of the Jews let us learn to attend to our own
   interests. The Church is almost always in such a condition as to be
   destitute of human aid, lest, if we were too largely furnished, we
   should be dazzled by our wealth and resources, and forget our God. We
   ought to be so well satisfied and so highly delighted with our weakness
   as to depend wholly on God. The small and gentle waters should be more
   highly valued by us than the large and rapid rivers of all the nations,
   and we ought not to envy the great power of the ungodly. Such is the
   import of what is written in the Psalms:

   "The streams of the river shall make glad the city of God, the
   sanctuary of the tabernacle of the Most High. God is in the midst of
   her; God will help her before the dawn. Let the heathen rage, let the
   kingdoms be moved, and let the earth melt when the sound is uttered.
   Jehovah of armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress." (Psalm
   46:4-7.)

   If it be objected that we ought not to reject human aid, the answer is
   easy. The Prophet does not condemn human aid, but he condemns that
   wicked fear by which we are thrown into distrust, and tremble, so that
   no promise of God can keep us within reasonable bounds. Now, we ought
   to render to God this honor, that though all things else should fail,
   we shall be satisfied with him alone, and shall be convinced that he is
   at hand. And in that case it matters little whether we have or have not
   outward assistance; if we have it, we are at liberty to use it; if we
   have it not, let us bear the want of it with patience, and let God
   alone suffice us for all that we need; for he will be able to execute
   his promises, since he has no need of any outward aid. Only let us
   trust entirely to his power and defense.

   8. And crossing over into Judah The verb chlph, (chalaph,) which
   sometimes signifies to pass through, here means to attack and cut off:
   that is, it will not only water Judea, but will overflow it, so as
   utterly to drown it; for it will spread far and wide on every part. He
   adds --

   Even to the neck. The comparison is taken from a man who, entering a
   river, dips into it gradually, till the water reaches to the neck. In
   this manner shall Judea be overflowed by that rapid river, that is, by
   the Assyrian, till he be plunged up to the neck. He means Jerusalem,
   which was the metropolis of the country; and when the Assyrian came to
   it, Judea was at no great distance from destruction.

   The breadth of thy land. That is, in all directions; for he pursues his
   metaphor in his prophecy, and shows how violent the Assyrian will be,
   and enlarges the representation of his strength and violence by the
   same comparison; that is, by comparing him to an impetuous river, which
   bursting through its barriers and overflowing its banks, spreads far
   and wide, and overturns and destroys everything by its violence. He
   proceeds in his discourse against the Jews, as he had begun to do in
   the two former verses; for, having foretold the destruction of the
   Israelites and Syrians, he likewise threatens that the Jews, in their
   turn, shall be punished for their unbelief.

   To understand this better, Isaiah's highly beautiful and closely
   connected discourse must be examined. First, he turned aside to address
   others; for Ahaz was unworthy of being addressed. The Lord will give
   you a sign; which was declared in the former chapter. Next, he adds the
   manner of preserving Jerusalem, by the sudden changes which should take
   place in Syria and Samaria. This was confirmed, in the beginning of
   this chapter, both by a commandment and by a vision. He now comes to
   the Jews themselves, that they may not hope to escape without being
   punished, or be too highly elated by the destruction of their enemies;
   for he declares that for them also a reward is prepared, and that they,
   too, will be punished for their wickedness and treachery, because they
   despised the Lord, and would not rest satisfied with his promises, and
   signs, and acts of kindness largely and bountifully offered.

   O Immanuel. It may be asked, Why does the Prophet direct his discourse
   to Christ, instead of simply calling the land "God's holy land?" For
   there can be no doubt that by the name Immanuel he means Christ. It
   might be thought that this expression was used in order to express the
   disgrace more strongly; for, since Judea not only was set apart to God,
   but in the person of the Mediator had God as the guardian of its
   safety, it was disgraceful that it should be destroyed by a heathen
   king. But I rather think that the Prophet added this name, in order to
   hold out to good men some remnant of hope, and to comfort them in so
   great a calamity; for, when the country was wasted and cruelly torn,
   they might have lost courage. He therefore means, that that desolation
   would not prevent the coming of the Redeemer, of whom he had formerly
   spoken. As if he had said, "Nevertheless, the land shall be thine, O
   Immanuel; in it shalt thou have thy residence and abode." This was,
   therefore, added instead of a consolation, in order to intimate that
   the land, though torn and wasted, belongs to God and not to men. The
   sudden change too a direct address (apostrophe) is emphatic; for in
   this way the Prophet solemnly declares his belief in redemption, that
   the Lord may set a limit to the frightful calamities.

   9. Associate yourselves. The verb rv, (rognu,) whether it be derived
   from rv (ruang) or from rh, (ragnah,) signifies to bruise. But as rh
   (ragnah) signifies to associate, some prefer taking it in this sense,
   which certainly agrees better with the scope and argument of the
   Prophet. Some render it, Bruise ye, that is, bruise the kingdom of
   Judah, or, bruise the Assyrians; but this appears to be unnatural or
   far-fetched. That it describes the plans and undertakings by which they
   endeavored to crush the Church of God, is evident from its being
   immediately added, and a second time repeated, by the Prophet, Gird
   you, that is, "Form a plan." The word associate, therefore, is the most
   suitable, unless, perhaps, it be thought preferable to take the verb rv
   (rognu) metaphorically; and I willingly favor that opinion, so as to
   make it mean to heap up [126] ; for those things which are bruised must
   of necessity be violently pressed and squeezed together. He therefore
   means not only gathering together, but likewise pressing closely
   together; as if he had said, "Draw close to one another, as if you were
   a dense mass." This meaning agrees beautifully, I think, with the scope
   of this passage; for to the same purpose is what he immediately adds,
   "Arm yourselves, Gird you."

   The Prophet rises into confidence after having mentioned Immanuel, that
   is, God, who would assist his people; and at the same time cherishes
   increased hope in opposition to enemies, that though it might be
   thought that they had gained their object when they had depopulated the
   country, still the Lord would be victorious, and would preserve his
   people against the cruelty of their enemies. Withdrawing his mind,
   therefore, from the sight of that calamity, he turns to Christ, and, by
   contemplating him, acquires such courage that he ventures to taunt his
   enemies as if he had vanquished them. We must view the Prophet as on a
   watch-tower, from which he beholds the distressed condition of the
   people, and the victorious Assyrians proudly exulting over them.
   Refreshed by the name and the sight of Christ, he forgets all his
   distresses, as if he had suffered nothing; and, freed from all his
   wretchedness, rises against the enemies whom the Lord would immediately
   destroy. This ought to be carefully observed; that, as we have still to
   contend against the same temptations amidst those afflictions which the
   Church endures, and by the weight of which it is almost overwhelmed, we
   may direct our eyes to Christ, by the sight of whom we shall be able to
   triumph over Satan and over enemies of every description.

   Ye peoples. [127] Why does he call them mym, (gnammim,) peoples, when
   it was the Assyrian only that would lay waste Judea? I reply, the army
   of the Assyrian was composed of various peoples; for he had subdued not
   only the Chaldeans, but many other peoples; and, accordingly, that
   monarchy consisted of various nations. Yet the Prophet might refer to
   the Israelites, the Syrians, and the Egyptians, and to all others who
   were enemies of the Church of God; for he does not speak of one stroke
   inflicted on the Church, but of the incessant contests which the chosen
   people had continually to endure. But in order to understand this
   better, we must join with it the following verse, at the end of which
   we find the words for Immanuel, that is, for God is with us; for this
   is the security for our deliverance. Let men league together, and
   contrive, and form plans and determinations, they will not be able to
   accomplish anything;

   for there is no counsel against the Lord, (Proverbs 21:30;)

   and therefore we must begin with this foundation, if we wish to stand
   firm.

   But we must ascertain if all men have a right to glory on that ground,
   for wicked men also boast that God is with them, and in his name do not
   scruple to grow insolent and haughty; but their glorying is idle and
   unfounded. Now, the valor of the godly rests on the word of God, and
   proceeds from true faith; and if this dwells in our minds, we may
   triumph over all our enemies; as Paul also teaches, when he encourages
   the godly by this doctrine,

   If God be for us, who shall be against us?
   (Romans 8:31.)

   First, then, we ought to make sure that God is with us, which cannot be
   unless we embrace the promises by faith; and if we have faith, we do
   not glory in vain. As to his addressing a nation so distant, to whom
   that word could not reach, the reason is obvious, that the efficacy of
   the word might be made known to unbelievers, and that they might know
   that he would restrain the Assyrians with all their warlike
   accoutrements, though they were at a great distance; as if he had said,
   "You do indeed despise God, but it will be easy for him to keep you at
   a distance, and to repress all your rage."

   Gird yourselves. This is not a superfluous repetition; for it is far
   more difficult to expect the assistance of God a second time, when we
   have once been delivered, than to embrace the promise of one single
   deliverance. Besides, although the first attacks of enemies do not so
   greatly alarm us, yet when we see them hardened in their malice, their
   obstinacy reduces us to weakness. We have experience of this every day;
   for if any danger threatens us, we may expect assistance from the Lord;
   but if we are again in danger, we give way; and so great is our
   ingratitude, that we scarcely think that God will help us a second
   time. In consequence of this, we faint if we are frequently brought
   into danger, and do not consider that God is never wearied by doing us
   good, and by continually assisting us.

   Isaiah, therefore, intended to oppose this frailty of men, that when
   armed foes had once and again attacked us, we may stand firm. If, after
   being vanquished or weakened, they again muster their forces, and do
   not cease to annoy us, let us not be discouraged; for to-morrow, and
   the next day, and as often as they league together, God will be able to
   frustrate and destroy them. Hence, also, we are reminded of our
   condition, that we may be always prepared for enduring additional
   conflicts, and may not think that we have done all that was required
   from us, when we have once resisted; for Satan is unwearied in his
   efforts, and continually labors to accomplish our destruction; he
   animates his soldiers, and inflames them with new eagerness. But
   although the contests must be often maintained, we are certain of
   victory, and therefore we ought to fight boldly, and to remain
   constantly on the field.

   10. Take counsel. After having spoken of the forces of the enemies, he
   now comes to their counsels; as if he had said, "Although the enemies
   may abound not only in armor and in strength, but, in counsel and
   wisdom, still they will accomplish nothing." And this warning was very
   necessary; for it often happens that we despise enemies, though
   powerful and well armed, because they want counsel, and are guided by
   blind violence rather than by reason. He therefore forewarns them that
   the craftiness of the enemies, and all the arts by which they endeavor
   to gain advantage over the people of God, will in the end be
   unsuccessful; and, therefore, that they will accomplish nothing, though
   they be in want of nothing, and though they may have a great abundance
   of everything, of forces, and counsels, and crafty designs. He adds --

   Speak the word. To make the meaning more clear, I have rendered it
   decree a decree. This relates to their insolence, or it is the
   conclusion of the consultation; for after deliberation a decree usually
   follows. He declares that all these things will vanish into smoke. It
   is, therefore, sufficiently evident what the Prophet means, and to what
   purpose this passage ought to be applied; for it may be regarded as a
   shield by which we can drive away all the terrors of enemies, whether
   they excel, on the one hand, in forces, wealth, power, influence, and
   rank; or, on the other, in wisdom, counsel, craftiness, sagacity, and
   invention, or, in a word, in insolence. For we are well armed and very
   powerful, if God is with us; and, therefore, all the contrivances or
   decrees of adversaries will immediately vanish away.

   For God is with us. ky mnv 'l, (ki Immanu-el;) literally, for Immanuel.
   We have already explained the force of this argument. [128] For my own
   part, I have no doubt that he alludes to the name which he formerly
   gave to Christ; for although he means that God assists his people, yet
   as the majesty of God is not of itself sufficient to support us, he
   contemplates God himself in the person of the Mediator, in whom alone
   he has promised to assist us.

   11. For thus Jehovah spake to me. Here the Prophet contends against
   another kind of temptations, that is, against the unbelief of the
   people; and in order to make that more manifest, it ought to be
   observed that there were two remarkable temptations, the one external,
   and the other internal. The external temptation came from professed
   enemies, such as from the Assyrian; and when the people saw his
   plundering and cruelty, they thought that all was over with them,
   because he had brought them almost to utter ruin. The other temptation
   was internal; for that sacred people, which boasted of having been
   chosen by God, relied on the assistance of man rather than of God. Now,
   this was a most dangerous temptation; for it appeared as if that
   nation, by its unbelief, refused admission to the promises of God,
   which were daily offered, and which were continually sounded in their
   ears. And what could the Prophet think, amidst so great perplexity, but
   that the destruction of this wicked people, which did not cease
   wickedly to reject the grace of God, was close at hand? The Lord,
   therefore, determined that both the Prophet and his disciples should be
   armed against a temptation of this kind.

   As if by taking hold of my hand. [129] This is a beautiful metaphor,
   which the commentators, I think, have not understood. He alludes to
   fathers or teachers, who, when their words have not sufficient effect,
   seize the hand of their children or scholars, and hold them so as to
   compel them to obey. Thus the servants of the Lord are sometimes
   disposed to throw everything away, because they think that they are
   laboring to no purpose; but the Lord lays as it were, his hand on them,
   and holds them fast, that they may go forward in the discharge of their
   duty. This is well understood to be very necessary, and is actually
   experienced by all who faithfully serve the Lord; for no temptation is
   more severe than when they in whom faith ought to dwell revolt; and, in
   a word, when faith appears to be banished from the world.

   This taking hold of the hand is, therefore, highly necessary, because
   not only are we fickle and liable to unsteadiness, but we are also by
   nature too much inclined to what is evil, though no one entice us. But
   if the force of custom be added, we are scarcely master of ourselves.
   Undoubtedly, we would every moment be driven up and down, were it not
   that we are held by the powerful government of God, and fix the anchor
   of constancy in firm ground. Every one of us ought to meditate
   earnestly on this thought; for though we may be convinced, yet when it
   comes to the trial we fail, and look at men rather than God. We should,
   therefore, attend more carefully to this doctrine, and pray to God to
   hold us, not only by his word but by laying his hand on us.

   Besides, it ought to be observed that we are exceedingly disposed to
   wicked imitation. When we see bad examples, we are drawn to them with
   great force, and take the example for a law; for when others go before
   us, we think that we have a right to act in the same manner, and
   especially when it is not only one or a few persons who have led the
   way, but the custom has become universal. What is in itself manifestly
   wrong is concealed by the plausible cloak of public opinion; and not
   only so, but all are carried, as it were, by the violence of a
   whirlwind, to adopt an established custom, as if the will of the people
   had the force of a law to authorize their corruptions. This has not
   been the fault of a single age, but at the present day it abounds as
   much or even more than before; for it is an evil deeply seated in all
   by the corruption of nature, to reckon a prevailing error as a law.
   Hence arise the superstitions of all ages, and those which at the
   present day exist in Popery, the origin of which, if it be
   investigated, will be found to be nothing else than that some persons
   have drawn others into the same error; and thus almost all have been
   foolishly caught by the snares of Satan, and the general agreement of
   men is still the chief foundation of those superstitions. All defend
   themselves by this weapon. "We are not alone," say they; "we follow an
   immense multitude."

   12. Say not, a conspiracy. First, we must consider what was the
   condition of that people, for they saw that they were not provided with
   numerous forces, and were not able to contend in battle against such
   powerful enemies. They longed for outward assistance, and eagerly
   desired to obtain it, for they thought that they were utterly ruined if
   they did not obtain the assistance of others. In this sense I
   understand the word conspiracy, that they thought it necessary to have
   the assistance of allies. The word conspiracy being employed by the
   Hebrews in different acceptations, and sometimes denoting a bond, I
   take it in a good sense. But some take it in a bad sense: "Behold thy
   enemies, the king of Israel and the king of Syria, have conspired
   together." But I rather agree with those who apply it to the league and
   friendship which many unbelievers were desirous to contract with the
   Assyrian. The Lord therefore admonishes Isaiah not to regard the
   counsels of wicked men, though the whole of the people should vie with
   each other in attending to them.

   Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. There may also be a twofold
   meaning; for some read it separately, as if in this second clause the
   Prophet condemned in general terms the wicked customs of the people.
   But these two clauses ought rather to be joined together. "Let it not
   distress you, if your countrymen in the present day plot about unlawful
   confederacies, and do not consent to them." Now, though the Prophet
   belonged to the number of those who needed to be admonished not
   foolishly to dissuade others from following by faith, yet the plural
   number, say ye not, shows that all the godly were taught in his person.

   Their fear. Hence we perceive what is the source of those wavering
   counsels by which men are agitated; it is, because their minds are
   overwhelmed by terror, so that they are violently hurried along without
   any moderation. He describes the cause of all this, why the Jews so
   eagerly desired to have the Assyrians for allies. It was because they
   were terrified beyond measure, and did not expect to be preserved in
   any other way, and because their blind fear did not permit them to look
   to the assistance of the Lord. This was the reason why they so eagerly
   desired a league. The same cause of fear was alleged both against the
   godly and against the ungodly; but all did not fear in the same manner,
   for the godly composed their minds, because they knew that God took
   care of their preservation, and, armed by the promise of God, cheered
   their hearts whenever they mentioned the name of Immanuel. But the
   ungodly, overcome by terror, thought of nothing but the assistance of
   the Assyrians, did not consider that there is help in God, and did not
   betake themselves to him. The Lord certainly does not forbid the godly
   to fear, for they cannot avoid that; but he bids them overcome that
   excessive terror by which the ungodly are swallowed up. Let us not,
   therefore, by their example, gaze around in every direction, and rush
   headlong to seek unlawful aid; and especially we must beware lest fear
   take away our judgment. There is but one remedy for this evil, to
   restrain ourselves by the word of God, from which proceeds real
   tranquillity of mind. Comparing the condition of that people with our
   own, let us learn to betake ourselves to the name of God, which will be
   to us an impregnable fortress. (Proverbs 18:10.)

   That the Lord did not speak to the Prophet alone, is also evident from
   the words being in the plural number, l' tyr'v, (lo thireu,) fear ye
   not. Peter also has drawn from it a general doctrine, (1 Peter 3:14,)
   warning us not to fear with the fear of the ungodly, but to place all
   our confidence in God, and to keep our eyes continually fixed on him,
   that we may remain steadfast, though heaven and earth should be
   mingled. If that warning of Peter was ever necessary, it is especially
   so in the present day, for we see all things tossed up and down and
   mingled in frightful confusion. That we may not be disturbed, the Lord
   withdraws us from beholding men, that we may, by attending to his word,
   keep our position firmly. Peter, indeed, understands this fear
   passively, while Isaiah understands it actively; for Peter exhorts
   believers to perseverance, so as not to waver on account of the threats
   and terrors of the ungodly; but Isaiah condemns the trembling, which
   induced the Jews to seek heathen alliances. But as it was not the
   intention of Peter to explain this passage, or even to quote the exact
   words, and as he meant only to allude to that statement, we need not
   wonder at this diversity.

   13. Sanctify Jehovah of hosts himself. We have said that the reason why
   dangers lead to immoderate alarm is, that wretched men do not raise
   their eyes and minds to heaven. The Prophet now, therefore, proposes a
   suitable remedy for allaying terrors, that they who dread the evils
   which threaten them may learn to give to God the honor due to him. To
   sanctify the God of armies means to exalt his power highly; so as to
   remember that he holds the government of the world, and that the
   beginning and the end of good and evil actions are at his disposal.
   Hence it follows that, in some respects, God is robbed of his holiness,
   when we do not immediately betake ourselves to him in cases of
   perplexity. This mode of expression, therefore, is highly emphatic; for
   it shows us that no higher affront can be offered to God than to give
   way to fear, as if he were not exalted above all creatures, so as to
   control all events. On the other hand, when we rely on his aid, and,
   through victorious steadfastness of faith, despise dangers, then do we
   actually ascribe to him lawful government; for if we are not convinced
   that innumerable methods, though unknown to us, are in his power for
   our deliverance, we conceive of him as a dead idol.

   And let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. He properly adds,
   that God himself should be the fear and the dread of the people, in
   order to inform them that there awaits them a just and lawful reward of
   their crimes and of their contempt of God, when they thus in
   wretchedness and alarm tremble at dangers. Though he speaks not only of
   fear but of dread, yet he does not mean that the Jews should be filled
   with horror at the name of God, so as to desire to flee from him, but
   merely demands from them reverence for God, and uses both words in
   order to express continuance. He therefore means that they will be free
   and exempted from solicitude of mind, if a sincere fear of God be
   deeply engraven on their hearts, and never pass away from them; and
   indeed every person who freely devotes himself to God, and undertakes
   to fear him alone, so as to lay this restraint on himself, will find
   that no haven is more safe than his protection. But as the ungodly do
   not cease to provoke his anger by shameless transgression, he harasses
   their minds by continual uneasiness, and thus inflicts the most
   appropriate revenge for their careless indifference.

   14. And he shall be for a sanctuary. He promises that the true
   worshippers of God will enjoy tranquillity of mind, because the Lord,
   covering them, as it were, under his wings, will quickly dispel all
   their fears. There is an allusion to the word sanctify which he had
   lately used; for the word mqds, (mikdash,) which means sometimes a
   sanctuary, and sometimes a place of refuge, is derived from the same
   root. [130] The meaning therefore is, that God demands nothing for
   which he does not offer mutual recompense, because every one that
   sanctifies him will undoubtedly find him to be a place of refuge. Now,
   although in this sanctification there is a mutual relation between us
   and God, yet there is a difference, for we sanctify him by ascribing
   all praise and glory to him, and by relying entirely upon him; but he
   sanctifies us, by guarding and preserving us from all evils. As there
   were few who believed and relied on his promises, the Prophet wished
   that the godly should be fortified against this kind of temptation; for
   there was a danger lest they should be carried away by such bad
   examples as by a kind of tempest.

   The Prophet therefore meant, "The Lord will be your best and most
   faithful guardian. Though others stumble against him, yet be not you
   terrified; remain steadfastly in your calling." And here a contrast is
   implied, though not expressed; for a sanctuary may be said to be a
   citadel situated in a lofty position, and a bulwark for defending and
   guarding the godly, but for destroying and overwhelming the ungodly,
   because they rashly stumble against it. We shall afterwards see more
   clearly how this was fulfilled, partly during the reign of Hezekiah,
   and partly at the time of the captivity into Babylon; and yet at the
   same time Christ was prefigured, who was to be not a place of refuge,
   but rather a stone of stumbling to the Israelites. Isaiah forewarns
   them of this stumbling, that the godly may be aware of it.

   To the two houses of Israel. The Jews ignorantly and improperly tear
   asunder this verse, instead of dividing it. "God will be," say they,
   "partly a sanctuary and partly a stone of stumbling; as if by the two
   families he distinguished between the godly and the unbelievers. On the
   contrary, he enjoins believers, though nearly the whole multitude of
   both kingdoms should dissuade them from obedience to God, not to be
   discouraged, but to disregard everything else, and break through all
   opposition. The Prophet might have simply said, he will be for an
   offense to Israel; but he intended to express more, for he includes the
   whole nation, and declares that God will be their destruction. The
   nation was divided into two kingdoms, Ephraim and Judah; and,
   therefore, he mentioned both. There were, indeed, some exceptions, but
   he speaks here of the whole body.

   This is a remarkable passage and cannot be sufficiently called to
   remembrance, especially at the present time, when we see the state of
   religion throughout the whole Christian world brought nearly to ruin.
   Many boast that they are Christians who are strongly alienated from
   God, and to whom Christ is a stone of stumbling. The papists insolently
   and proudly boast of his name, though they profane the whole of his
   worship by superstitions, and bring upon it dishonor and reproach.
   Among those to whom a purer worship of God has been restored, there are
   very few who embrace the Gospel of God with sincere regard. Wherever we
   turn our eyes, very sore temptations meet us in every direction; and,
   therefore, we ought to remember this highly useful instruction, that it
   is no new thing, if a great multitude of persons, and almost all who
   boast that they belong to the Church, stumble against God. Yet let us
   constantly adhere to him, however small may be our numbers.

   For a snare to the inhabitant of Jerusalem. This is the second
   circumstance introduced for heightening the picture; for, after having
   mentioned the two kingdoms, he names the metropolis itself. Although
   the whole country was crippled, yet it seemed that the Lord kept his
   abode there. He therefore means that God became a snare, not only to
   the common people who were scattered throughout the fields and
   villages, but to the nobles themselves, and to the priests who dwelt in
   Jerusalem, who dwelt in that holy habitation in which God intended that
   the remembrance of his name should be chiefly preserved. That was
   testified also by David, that those builders whom the Lord appointed
   rejected the chief corner-stone. (Psalm 118:22.) Christ quotes this
   passage against the Jews, and shows that it applies to himself.
   (Matthew 21:42; Mark 12:10.) This happened, indeed, in the time of
   Isaiah, but still more in the time of Christ; for ungodliness and
   rebellion gradually increased till they came to a height. Accordingly,
   both the highest and the lowest, who always had obstinately disobeyed
   God, at that time broke out against him still more with unrestrained
   indulgence, and therefore their destruction also reached its height;
   for they were altogether rejected by God, whose Son they had refused.
   Hence also we infer the eternal divinity of Christ, for Paul shows that
   it is God of whom the Prophet here speaks. (Romans 9:33.) Now, he
   speaks not of a pretended God, but of that God by whom heaven and earth
   were created, and who revealed himself to Moses. (Exodus 3:6.) It is,
   therefore, the same God by whom the Church has been always governed.

   15. And many among them shall stumble. He goes on to threaten the
   ungodly, as he had formerly begun, and declares that those who refuse
   to trust in God will not escape without being punished. The threatening
   runs thus: "when they have stumbled, they will then fall, and
   afterwards they will be bruised." This agrees with the former metaphor,
   in which he compared God to a stone. Christ has alluded to that
   metaphor, including both clauses.

   "He who shall fall on this stone will be broken; but on whomsoever it
   shall fall, it will bruise him."
   (Matthew 21:44.)

   And shall be snared and taken. This agrees with the latter metaphor, in
   which he compared God to a snare and gin. Let not the ungodly,
   therefore, imagine that they are stronger or wiser than God; for they
   will find that he excels them in strength and wisdom, and that to their
   destruction. They must, therefore, unavoidably be ruined; for either
   they will be utterly bruised, or they will be snared in such a manner,
   that they can never extricate themselves.

   This threatening also regards the godly, that they may not hesitate to
   withdraw from holding fellowship with the multitude, and that they may
   not resolutely disregard the sinfulness of revolt. Now, this does not
   strictly belong to God, but is rather, as we would say, accidental; for
   it belongs to God to receive men into his favor, and to give them a
   firm security for their salvation. That was more clearly manifested in
   Christ, and is still manifested; and, therefore, Peter reminds us that,
   though many unbelievers stumble, this is no reason why their stumbling
   should obstruct the progress of our faith; for Christ is
   notwithstanding a chosen and precious stone. (1 Peter 2:4.)

   16. Bind up the testimony. The Lord now turns his discourse to the
   Prophet, and encourages him, while he must contend against apostates
   and rebels, to discharge his office with boldness and perseverance.
   This was highly necessary, for Isaiah had met with great obstinacy in
   the people; so that if he had only looked at their present condition,
   that is, at the unbelief of the people, and his fruitless and
   unsuccessful exertions, he must have altogether given way. On this
   account the Lord determined to confirm and seal his calling, not only
   on his account, but for the sake of all who should obey his doctrine;
   and if very few persons believed the words of the Prophet, still the
   Lord testifies that his doctrine has been sealed to them, and that,
   therefore, neither must he desist from his office of teaching, nor must
   they cease to yield the obedience of faith.

   Seal the law. He compares the doctrine of the word to a sealed letter,
   which may indeed be felt and handled by many persons, but yet is read
   and understood by few, that is, by those to whom it is sent and
   addressed. Thus the word of God is received by few, that is, by the
   elect, though it is held out indiscriminately to all. The word is
   therefore sealed to those who derive no advantage from it, and is
   sealed in such a manner that the Lord unseals and opens it to his own
   people by the Spirit. Some derive the verb tsvr (tzor) from ntsr,
   (natzar,) and translate it keep. But though this does not greatly
   affect the general meaning, still the superiority of the rendering
   which I have followed [131] may be proved from the other verb seal; for
   the custom in ancient times was, first, to tie a thread around a
   letter, and then to seal it.

   We draw from it this highly useful doctrine, namely, that teachers and
   ministers of the word ought constantly to persevere in discharging
   their office, though it may seem that all men revolt, and give no
   evidence of anything but obstinacy and rebellion; for the Lord will
   reserve for himself some disciples, by whom his letter will be read
   with advantage, though it be closed to others. The Prophet afterwards
   employs the same metaphor, when he says, that the word is like a closed
   book, (Isaiah 29:11;) but there he only mentions wicked men, and here
   he mentions disciples, to whom the doctrine of the word is not without
   advantage.

   It may be objected, Was it then the duty of the Prophet to disregard
   the people, and to withdraw and shut himself up with the disciples,
   among whom some good effect was produced? I reply, this was not the
   Prophet's meaning; for it was the will of the Lord that Isaiah should
   appear in public, and cry aloud, and reveal his will to all. But as he
   spoke to the deaf, and might be discouraged by seeing no evidence of
   the fruit of his labors, the Lord determined to excite and encourage
   him to go forward, even when matters were in a desperate condition,
   and, satisfied with his disciples, though their number was small, to
   become every day more and more courageous.

   17. Therefore I will wait for the Lord. [132] I have chosen to render
   the particle v (vau) by therefore; for the Prophet recovers himself,
   after having received from the Lord the consolation which we have just
   now seen. "Seeing that the Lord is pleased to have disciples to whom
   his doctrine is sealed, I will wait for him, though he hath hid his
   face from Jacob, that is, hath rejected and cast off his people." This
   is a remarkable passage, and, by meditating continually on it, we must
   be greatly encouraged; for though it may seem as if the whole world had
   revolted, still we ought boldly to persevere; and even though God hath
   hid his face from his people, and they who professed his name have been
   cast off, still we ought to wait for him with unshaken hope. This is
   the only remedy that is left to us.

   The word wait is exceedingly emphatic; as if he had said, "Still I will
   not turn aside from God, I will persevere in faith." He increases the
   force of it by adding, I will look for him; for the occurrence of any
   offense is wont to make our faith waver and faint, and it is most
   grievously shaken when we see that we are deprived of allies, and that
   there are open enemies who boldly take to themselves the name of the
   Church. Offenses commonly turn us aside from God, and perplex us in
   such a manner that we call in question the truth of the word. This
   consolation is therefore highly necessary, whether the Church is
   oppressed by outward calamities, or thrown into confusion by the
   treachery of the multitude.

   18. Behold, I. Here the Prophet not only testifies that he will wait
   patiently, but also gives an evidence of courage, by appearing in
   public along with the disciples whom he had gained to God, and who
   still remained. As if he had said, "Though others may withdraw, yet I
   am ready to obey thee, and I bring along with me those whom thou hast
   been pleased to preserve in a wonderful manner through my agency." He
   therefore declares by these words his unshaken courage, and promises
   that he will persevere in faith and obedience to the Lord, though all
   should revolt.

   And the children. By children are meant the various classes of
   servants, agreeably to the ordinary custom of the Hebrew, and also of
   the Latin language. [133] He speaks of the disciples whom he had
   formerly mentioned. Hence we see what is demanded from those who wish
   to be reckoned among the true disciples of the Lord. It is, to declare
   with Isaiah that they are submissive and ready to hear, and that, as
   soon as the Lord has spoken, they will yield immediate obedience. Now,
   teachers ought to bring disciples with them, and not merely to send
   them before; they ought, I say, to go before them, and by their example
   to point out the way, as was formerly explained, [134] (Isaiah 2:3;)
   otherwise they will have no authority in teaching. The apostle to the
   Hebrews applies this passage to Christ, (Hebrews 2:13,) and draws from
   it an instruction which ought to be a very powerful excitement to us,
   that considering ourselves to be followers not only of Isaiah, but of
   Christ himself, as our leader and instructor, we may press forward with
   greater alacrity.

   Whom the Lord hath given me. By this the Prophet shows to whom our
   faith ought to be ascribed. It is to God, and to his undeserved
   election; for Isaiah taught publicly, admonished every person, and
   invited all without exception to come to God; but his doctrine is of
   advantage to those only who have been given to him by God. By given he
   means those whom God drew by an inward and secret operation of his
   Spirit, when the sound of the external voice fell on the ears of the
   multitude without producing any good effect. In like manner Christ
   declares that the elect were given to him by the Father. (John 17:6.)
   Thus we see that readiness to believe does not depend on the will of
   men; but that some of the multitude believe, because, as Luke tells us,
   they had been foreordained. (Acts 13:48.) Now, whom he foreordained he
   likewise calls, (Romans 8:30,) and efficaciously seals in them the
   proof of their adoption, that they may become obedient and submissive.
   Such, therefore, is the giving of which Isaiah now speaks. This applies
   strictly to Christ, to whom the Father presents and gives disciples, as
   it is said in the Gospel by John,

   No man cometh to me, unless the Father hath drawn him.
   (John 6:44.)

   Hence it follows, that he is also appointed to be our guardian, to
   preserve us under his protection to the end. (John 10:28.) Wherefore he
   saith,

   not one of those whom the Father hath given to me shall perish. (John
   17:12.)

   For signs and wonders. Some consider this passage to refer to miracles,
   but that is inapplicable, for the meaning is totally different, namely,
   that all the godly will be regarded not only with hatred, but even with
   abhorrence, as if they had been monsters; and that not only by
   strangers or by professed enemies, but even by Israel. We have
   experience of this at the present day; for papists look upon us with
   greater abhorrence than they look upon Mahometans or Jews, or even dogs
   or monsters. Though this is exceedingly base, we need not greatly
   wonder at it; for it was necessary that this prophecy should even now
   be fulfilled. It was experienced by Isaiah from his countrymen, and has
   been experienced by all others who have followed his doctrine.

   Nor is it only in papists that we discover it, but in those who wish to
   be regarded as very closely connected with the Church, the greater part
   of whom either view us with strong dislike, or ridicule us, or, in a
   word, hold us to be monsters, because we are so anxious, and give
   ourselves so much uneasiness, about the salvation of the Church, the
   honor of God, and eternal life; and because we do not scruple to
   undergo so many dangers, such hatred, censure, reproach, banishment,
   poverty, hunger, nakedness, and, in a word, death itself. These things
   appear monstrous to them; for when they are so careful to protect their
   skin, how could they have a relish for the highest blessings? But that
   we may not be disturbed by their reproaches, we must arm ourselves with
   this exhortation of the Prophet.

   From the Lord of hosts. To show how trifling and worthless is the
   conspiracy of the wicked multitude, he contrasts the God of armies with
   the pride of the whole world, and raises a lofty defiance; as if he had
   said, that he cared not though he were universally abhorred by men,
   because he knew that God was on his side.

   Who dwelleth in Mount Zion. The addition of these words carries great
   weight; for although the people abounded in every kind of crimes and
   enormities, still they boasted that they were devoted to God, and,
   abusing his promises, condemned the true servants of God who reproved
   them. On the other hand, the Prophets, in order to shake off their
   false confidence and pride, declared that they were the servants of the
   only and true God, whom the people falsely boasted of worshipping in
   Mount Zion. God had not chosen it for his habitation as if, because he
   was bound to the spot, he would accept of false and spurious worship,
   but he wished to be sought and worshipped according to the rule of his
   word.

   Accordingly, when Isaiah claims for himself God who dwelleth in Mount
   Zion, he sharply reproves hypocrites, because through false boasting
   they indulge in foolish pride whenever they say, The temple of the
   Lord, (Jeremiah 7:4,) for it was rather an idol in which they boasted
   contrary to the word. Though they snatched at the promises, yet they
   falsely tortured them against the true servants of God, as the papists
   at the present day are wont to torture them against us. The Prophets,
   therefore, distinguish God by this title, in order to tear the mask
   from hypocrites, who were accustomed to quote the mere name of the
   temple in opposition to the plain word of God. For this reason Isaiah
   now says, "Take us, if you choose, for monsters, yet God acknowledges
   us to be his own; and you cannot detest us without at the same time
   abhorring the God of Abraham and David, whose servants we are."

   19. And when they shall say to you. Isaiah continues the former
   subject, which is, that all the godly should not only use the authority
   of God as a shield, but should fortify themselves with it as a brazen
   wall, to contend against all ungodliness. He therefore entreats them to
   resist courageously if any one shall tempt them to superstition and
   unlawful modes of worship. The plural number is employed by him in
   order to signify that it was a vice which pervaded all ranks, and which
   abounded everywhere; as if he had said, "I see what will happen; you
   will be placed in great danger; for your countrymen will endeavor to
   draw you away from the true God; for, being themselves ungodly, they
   will wish you to resemble them." At the same time he shows how wickedly
   they had departed from God's law and covenant, by shamelessly pushing
   forward diviners and soothsayers whose name ought to have been held by
   them in abhorrence.

   Should not a people ask counsel of their God? Some read these words in
   connection with what goes before, applying them to the ungodly, as if
   this were a pretense which they abused in order to deceive the simple;
   because there is no nation that has not oracles and revelations, but
   every nation consults its gods, or, in place of them, magicians and
   soothsayers. But what I reckon to be the more correct view is, that
   Isaiah advises his disciples to give this answer if they shall happen
   to be tempted to wicked modes of worship. Still the meaning is not
   fully cleared up; for this passage is commonly expounded as if it were
   a comparison drawn from the less to the greater. "What! seeing that the
   Gentiles consult their gods, and yet these gods are false, shall we not
   more highly esteem him whom we know to be the true God, and who hath
   revealed himself to us by so many proofs? What a shame will it be if
   their idols are more highly valued by the Gentiles than God is by us!"

   But I interpret this as referring to the Jews themselves, who were
   called by way of eminence (kat ' exochen) the people, because God had
   adopted them. Nor is it of any importance that the Prophet employs the
   plural form 'lhyv, [135] (elohaiv;) for 'lhym (elohim) is used as in
   the singular number. This is a shield by which all the superstitions
   which come imperceptibly upon us ought to be repelled. While some
   ponder and hesitate whether or not it be proper to consult diviners,
   let us have this answer in readiness, that God alone ought to be
   consulted. The Prophet alludes to that passage in Deuteronomy in which
   the Lord forbade them to go to magicians and soothsayers; and lest they
   should excuse themselves on the pretense that every nation had its
   interpreters or fortune-tellers, added, that they would not cease to
   have a Prophet, or be deprived of necessary instruction (Deuteronomy
   18:10-15.) It was therefore the will of the Lord that they should
   depend entirely on his word, and should learn from it alone whatever
   was useful for them to know, and should render obedience to him.

   From the living to the dead. The preposition vd (begnad) is variously
   rendered: frequently it is translated for; and in that case the meaning
   will be, "Shall the dead be consulted for the business of the living?"
   But as that meaning is forced, it would perhaps be better to explain it
   thus: "The Lord desires to be our teacher, and for that purpose hath
   appointed prophets, that we may learn from them his will, for a prophet
   is the mouth of the Lord. It is therefore unlawful to go to the dead,
   who have not been appointed for that end; for God did not intend to
   make use of the dead for instructing us."

   But when I examine the whole matter more closely, I choose rather to
   consider vd (begnad) to mean from, that is, from the living to the
   dead; as if he had said, "One God is sufficient for us for the living
   and the dead. If you search through heaven, earth, and hell, you will
   find that one God is sufficient for us." This is, I think, the best
   sense, and flows naturally. Accordingly, the Prophet arms the godly
   against the schemes and contrivances of wicked men by whom they might
   otherwise have been tempted to revolt, with the exhortation to be
   satisfied with God alone as their teacher, and not to offer him such an
   insult as to disregard his instruction and seek other teachers, but to
   cast away everything else, and depend on his truth alone, which
   immediately afterwards he again repeats and confirms.

   20. To the law and testimony. There are indeed various ways of
   explaining this passage. Some think that it is the form of an oath, as
   if the Prophet were swearing by the law that they were apostates, and
   would entice others to a similar apostasy. But I take a different view
   of it, which is, that he directs our attention to the law and the
   testimony; for the preposition l, (lamed,) to, plainly shows that this
   is the meaning. Now, the testimony is joined with the law, not as if it
   were different, but for the sake of explanation, "to the law," which
   contains the testimony or declaration of the will of God toward us. In
   short, we ought to take the word testimony as describing a quality, in
   order to inform us what advantage we derive from the law; namely, that
   God reveals himself to us in the law, and declares what is that
   relation to us which he chooses to hold, and lays down what he demands
   from us, and in short everything necessary to be known.

   It is therefore a very high commendation of the law that it contains
   the doctrine of salvation, and the rule of a good and happy life. For
   this reason also he justly forbids us to turn aside from it in the
   smallest degree; as if he should say, "Forsake all the superstitions on
   which they are so madly bent; for they are not satisfied with having
   God alone, and call to their aid innumerable inventions." In this
   manner also Christ speaks,

   They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them, (Luke 16:29;)

   for though Abraham is there brought forward as the speaker, still it is
   a permanent oracle which is uttered by the mouth of God. We are
   therefore enjoined to hear the law and the prophets, that we may not be
   under the influence of eager curiosity, or seek to learn anything from
   the dead. If the law and the prophets had not been sufficient, the Lord
   would not have refused to allow us other assistance.

   Hence we learn that everything which is added to the word must be
   condemned and rejected. It is the will of the Lord that we shall depend
   wholly on his word, and that our knowledge shall be confined within its
   limits; and therefore, if we lend our ears to others, we take a liberty
   which he has forbidden, and offer to him a gross insult. Everything
   that is introduced by men on their own authority will be nothing else
   than a corruption of the word; and consequently, if we wish to obey
   God, we must reject all other instructors. He likewise warns us that,
   if we abide by the law of the Lord, we shall be protected against
   superstitions and wicked modes of worship; for, as Paul calls

   the word of God is the sword of the Spirit,
   (Ephesians 6:17,)

   so by the word, Satan and all his contrivances are put to flight. We
   ought therefore to flee to him whenever we shall be attacked by
   enemies, that, being armed with it, we may contend valiantly, and at
   length put them to flight.

   If they shall not speak. I do not relate all the expositions of this
   passage, for that would be too tedious; and I consider the true
   exposition to be so well supported that it will easily refute all
   others. It is usually explained to mean that wicked men trifle with
   their inventions, and expose their impostures to sale, because there is
   no light in them; that is, because they have not ordinary
   understanding. For my own part, I consider this to be a reason for
   encouraging believers to perseverance; that if wicked men depart from
   the true doctrine, they will evince nothing else than their own
   blindness and darkness. We ought to despise their folly, that it may
   not be an obstruction to us; as Christ also teaches us that we should
   boldly set aside such persons, so as not to be in any degree affected
   by their blindness or obstinacy. "They are blind," says he, "and
   leaders of the blind. Do you wish of your own accord to perish with
   them?" (Matthew 15:14.)

   The Prophet therefore enjoins us to ascribe to the word such high
   authority, that we shall venture boldly to despise the whole world, if
   the word be opposed by them; for if even angels should do this, we
   might condemn them also by the authority of the word.

   If an angel from heaven, says Paul, preach anything else, let him be
   accursed. (Galatians 1:8, 9.)

   How much more boldly, therefore, shall we condemn men who set
   themselves in opposition to God? The mode of expression is emphatic, If
   they shall not speak according to this word. He brings an accusation of
   blindness against every man who does not instantly and without dispute
   adopt this sentiment, that we ought not to be wise beyond the law of
   God.

   21. Then they shall pass through that land. Not to permit believers to
   be ensnared by the common errors, he adds how dreadful is the
   punishment which awaits the ungodly when they have revolted from God,
   and have labored to induce others to join in the same revolt. The
   passage is somewhat obscure; but the obscurity arises from the want of
   proper attention in examining the words. The verb vr (gnabar) is
   emphatic; for by passing through he means that uncertainty in which men
   wander up and down, and are not able to find a resting-place, or any
   permanent abode. To the indefinite verb we must supply a noun, The Jews
   shall pass. By the pronoun vh, (bahh,) in it, [136] he means Judea,
   which the Lord had preferred to all other countries; and therefore it
   is easily understood, though the Prophet does not express it. As if he
   had said, "I promised indeed that that country would be the perpetual
   inheritance of my people, (Genesis 13:15; 17:8;) but they shall lead a
   wandering and restless life, as is the case with those who, driven from
   their habitations, and afflicted with hunger and pestilence and every
   kind of calamities, seek, but nowhere find, a better condition and
   abode." These words are therefore contrasted with the extraordinary
   kindness of God, which is so frequently mentioned by Moses, namely,
   that they will have a fixed residence in Judea; for here he threatens
   that they will be stragglers and wanderers, not in their own, but in a
   foreign country; so that, wherever they come, they will be attacked and
   hunted down by innumerable vexations.

   When they shall be hungry. The Prophet appears to point out the
   conversion of the Jews, as if he had said, "When they have been weighed
   down by afflictions they will at length repent;" and undoubtedly this
   is the remedy by which the Lord generally cures the disease of
   obstinacy. Yet if any one suppose that the word hunger describes the
   indignation and roaring of the wicked without repentance, it may be
   stated that it includes not only hunger and thirst, but, by a figure of
   speech in which a part is taken for the whole, (sunekdochikos,) every
   other kind of calamity.

   They shall fret themselves. [137] They will begin to be displeased with
   themselves, and to loathe all the supports on which they had formerly
   relied; and this is the beginning of repentance; for in prosperity we
   flatter ourselves, but in sore adversity we loathe everything that is
   around us. But if it be thought preferable to refer it to the
   reprobate, this word denotes the bitterness, which is so far from
   leading them to humility that it rather aggravates their rage.

   And curse their king and their God. By King some suppose that he means
   God. In this sense Zephaniah used the word mlkm (malcham), that is,
   their King. (Zephaniah 1:5.) But here I draw a distinction between King
   and God; for wicked men are first blinded by a false confidence in
   idols, and afterwards they place their defense in earthly things. When
   the Jews had a king, they were proud of his glory and power; and when
   Isaiah preached, wicked men enraged the king against him, and even
   aroused the whole of the nation to follow the king as their
   standard-bearer. Since, therefore, their false boasting had been partly
   in the idols and partly in the king, he threatens that they will be
   afflicted with so many calamities, that they will be constrained to
   abhor both their gods and the king. And this is the beginning of
   repentance, to loathe and drive far from us everything that kept us
   back or led us away from God.

   And look upward. He describes the trembling and agitation of mind by
   which wretched men are tormented until they have learned steadfastly to
   look up. There is, indeed, some proficiency, as I lately hinted, when,
   in consequence of having been taught by afflictions and chastisements,
   we throw away our indifference and endeavor to find out remedies. But
   we must advance farther. Fixing our eye on God alone we must not gaze
   on all sides, or through fickleness be tossed to and fro. (Ephesians
   4:14.) However that may be, Isaiah threatens the utter destruction of
   the Jews; for so thoroughly were they hardened, that their rebellion
   could not be subdued by a light and moderate chastisement from the hand
   of God. Yet it might be taken in a good sense, that the Jews will at
   length raise their eyes to heaven; but in that case we must read
   separately what follows: --

   22. And when they shall look to the earth. The meaning will then be,
   that the Jews will be converted to God, because they will be deprived
   of every assistance on the earth, and will see nothing but frightful
   calamities, to whatever side they turn their eyes.

   Behold, trouble and darkness. These words are partly figurative and
   partly literal; for by dimness and darkness he means nothing else than
   adversity, according to the custom of Scripture. But he adds, driven to
   darkness. This aggravates the calamity to an amazing degree; for if one
   who is in darkness be driven or pushed forward, he is far more in
   danger of stumbling than before. Thus he intimates, that to a heavy
   calamity another still heavier will be added, that they may be more
   completely ruined; for he means nothing else than that the judgments of
   God will be so dreadful, and the punishments so severe, that, whether
   they will or not, they shall be constrained to look up to heaven.

   CHAPTER 9

   Isaiah Chapter 9:1-21

   1. Nevertheless, the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation,
   when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the
   land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the
   way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations.

   1. Non tamen obscuratio juxta angustiam quae ei accidit tempore quo
   primum leviter attigerunt terram Zabulon et terram Nephtali: nec
   posterius, cum aggravarunt per viam maris ultra Iordanem, in Galilaea
   Gentium.

   2. The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they
   that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light
   shined.

   2. Populus ambulans in tenebris vidit lucem magnam. Qui habitabant in
   terra umbrae mortis, lux affulsit super eos.

   3. Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy
   before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when
   they divide the spoil.

   3. Multiplicando gentem non auxisti laetitiam, laetati sunt coram te
   secundum laetitiam in messe, quemadmodum exultant dividendo spolia.

   4. For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
   shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.

   4. Quoniam jugum ejus onerosum, et virgam humeri ejus, sceptrum
   exactoris ejus confregisti, sicut in die Madian.

   5. For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments
   rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.

   5. Quanquam omne proelium bellantis fit cum strepitu et volutatione
   vestis in sanguine; erit hoc in combustionem, cibum ignis.

   6. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the
   government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
   Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, the
   Prince of Peace.

   6. Quia puer natus est nobis; et constitutus est principatus super
   humerum ejus; et vocabitur nomen ejus, Admirabilis, Consiliarius, Deus
   fortis, Pater seculi, princeps pacis.

   7. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end,
   upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to
   establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for
   ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.

   7. Multiplicationi principatus et paci non erit finis; super solium
   David, et super regnum ejus, ut disponat et stabiliat ipsum in judicio
   et justitia, ab hoc tempore usque in perpetuum. Zelus Iehovae
   exercituum hanc rem faciet.

   8. The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.

   8. Verbum misit Dominus in Iacob, et cecidit in Israel.

   9. And all the people shall know, even Ephraim, and the inhabitants of
   Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

   9. Et sciet populus, omnes Ephraim, et incolae Samariae, qui dicunt in
   superbia et altitudine cordis,

   10. The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the
   sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.

   10. Lateres ceciderunt, et politis aedificabimus; sycomori succisae
   sunt, et cedros sufficiemus.

   11. Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against
   him, and join his enemies together;

   11. Atqui roborabit Iehova hostes Rezin contra ipsum; et inimicos ejus
   coadjuvabit.

   12. The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall
   devour Israel with open mouth. For all this anger is not turned away,
   but his hand is stretched out still.

   12. Syria a fronte, et Philistaei a tergo; devorabuntque Israel toto
   ore. Nec in hoc toto aversus erit furor ejus, sed manus ejus adhuc
   extenta.

   13. For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do
   they seek the Lord of hosts:

   13. Atqui populus non est reversus ad percussorem suum; nec Iehovam
   exercituum quaesierunt.

   14. Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch
   and rush, in one day.

   14. Abscindet ergo Iehova ab Israele caput et caudam, ramum et
   arundinem die uno.

   15. The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that
   teacheth lies, he is the tail.

   15. Senex et vulta suspiciendus, hic est caput: Propheta autem qui
   docet mendacium, hic est cauda.

   16. For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are
   led of them are destroyed.

   16. Nam gubernatores populi hujus, sunt seductores; et qui reguntur in
   eo, perditi.

   17. Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither
   shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an
   hypocrite and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all
   this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

   17. Propterea super adolescentibus ejus non gaudebit Dominus; et
   pupillorum ejus et viduarum non miserebitur. Quoniam omnes sunt
   hypocritae et scelerati, et omne os loquitur nequitiam. In hoc toto non
   erit aversus furor ejus, sed adhuc manus ejus extenta.

   18. For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briars and
   thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest; and they shall
   mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

   18. Quoniam succensa est velut ignis impietas; vepres et spinas
   devorabit. Postea exardebit in condensa sylvae; et elevabitur fumus
   ascendentis.

   19. Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened, and
   the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his
   brother.

   19. Prae ira Iehovae exercituum obscurabitur terra, et fiet populus
   quasi cibus ignis. Nemo fratri suo parcet.

   20. And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall
   eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat
   every man the flesh of his own arm:

   20. Rapiet quisque ad dexteram, et esuriet; comedet ad sinistram, et
   non saturabitur: quisque carnem brachii sui devorabit;

   21. Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall
   be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his
   hand is stretched out still.

   21. Menasse Ephraim, et Ephraim Menasse; pariter ipsi contra Iudam. Nec
   in hoc toto aversus erit furor ejus; sed manus ejus adhuc extenta.


   1. Yet the darkness shall not be. He begins to comfort the wretched by
   the hope of alleviation, that they may not be swallowed up by the huge
   mass of distresses. Many take these words in quite an opposite meaning,
   that is, as a threatening which denounces against the Jews a heavier
   affliction than that with which Tiglath-pileser (2 Kings 15:29) and
   Shalmanezer (2 Kings 17:6) afflicted them. The former inflicted a heavy
   calamity, the latter inflicted one still heavier, for he carried the
   twelve tribes into captivity, and blotted out the name of the nation.
   Some think that he now foretells the heaviest calamity of all, for if
   it be compared with the former two, it exceeds both of them. Though I
   am not prepared to reject this view, for it does not want plausibility,
   yet I rather favor a different opinion. The other interpretation is
   indeed more plausible, that the Prophet intended to deprive hypocrites
   of every enjoyment, that they might not imagine that this calamity
   would quickly pass away like a storm as the others had done, for it
   would be utterly destructive; and so we shall take the particle ky (ki)
   in its literal meaning. [138]

   But in my opinion it is most appropriate to view it as a consolation,
   in which he begins to mitigate what he had said about that frightful
   darkness and driving, (Isaiah 8:22,) and, by allaying the bitterness of
   those punishments, encourages them to expect the favor of God. As if he
   had said, "and yet, amidst that shocking calamity which the Jews shall
   endure, the darkness will not be such as when the land of Israel was
   afflicted, first, by Tiglath-pileser, (2 Kings 15:29,) and afterwards
   more grievously by Shalmanezer," (2 Kings 17:6.) Amidst so great
   extremities believers might otherwise have fainted, if their hearts had
   not been cheered by some consolation. Isaiah therefore directs his
   discourse to them lest they should think that they were ruined, for he
   intimates that the chastisements which are now to be inflicted will be
   lighter than those which came before. That this is the natural
   interpretation will quickly appear from what immediately follows.

   But why does the Prophet say that this calamity, which was far more
   dreadful, would be more mild and gentle? For Jerusalem was to be razed,
   the temple thrown down, and the sacrifices abolished, which had
   remained untouched during the former calamities. It might be thought
   that these were the severest of all, and that the former, in comparison
   of them, were light. But it ought to be observed, that while in the
   former instances there was no promise, an explicit promise was added to
   this threatening. By this alone can temptations be overcome and
   chastisements be rendered light. By this seasoning alone, I say, are
   our afflictions alleviated; and all who are destitute of it must
   despair. But if, by means of it, the Lord strengthen us by holding out
   the hope of assistance, there is no affliction so heavy that we shall
   not reckon it to be light.

   This may be made plain by a comparison. A man may happen to be drowned
   in a small stream, and yet, though he had fallen into the open sea, if
   he had got hold of a plank he might have been rescued and brought on
   shore. In like manner the slightest calamities will overwhelm us if we
   are deprived of God's favor; but if we relied on the word of God, we
   might come out of the heaviest calamity safe and uninjured.

   As to the words, some take mvph (mugnaph) for an adjective, as if the
   Prophet said, It shall not be darkened; but the feminine pronoun which
   immediately follows, vh (bahh), in her, does not allow us to refer this
   to men. It is more accurately described by others to be a substantive
   noun; and, therefore, I have resolved to render it literally, there
   shall not be darkness in Judea according to the affliction of the time
   when, etc. Some explain hql (hekal) to mean that the land was relieved
   of a burden, in consequence of the people having been carried into
   captivity; but this is altogether at variance with the Prophet's
   meaning, and does not agree with what follows; for it is immediately
   added that the seacoast has been more grievously afflicted by a second
   calamity. There can be no doubt, therefore, that this verb corresponds
   to the other verb hkvyd, (hikbid.) [139] Not more than a small part of
   the kingdom having been afflicted by Tiglath-pileser, the calamity
   which he brought upon it is said to be light as compared with the
   second which was inflicted by Shalmanezer.

   By the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the Gentiles. He
   calls it the way of the sea, because Galilee was adjoining to the coast
   of the Mediterranean Sea, and on one side it was bounded by the course
   of the Jordan. It is called Galilee of the Gentiles, not only because
   it was contiguous to Tyre and Sidon, but because it contained a great
   multitude of Gentiles, who were mingled with the Jews; for from the
   time that Solomon granted this country to King Hiram, (1 Kings 9:11,)
   it could never be subdued in such a manner as not to have some part of
   it possessed by the Gentiles

   2. The people walking in darkness hath seen a great light. He speaks of
   future events in the past tense, and thus brings them before the
   immediate view of the people, that in the destruction of the city, in
   their captivity, and in what appeared to be their utter destruction,
   they may behold the light of God. It may therefore be summed up in this
   manner: "Even in darkness, nay, in death itself, there is nevertheless
   good ground of hope; for the power of God is sufficient to restore life
   to his people, when they appear to be already dead." Matthew, who
   quotes this passage, appears to torture it to a different meaning; for
   he says that this prediction was fulfilled when Christ preached along
   the sea-coast. (Matthew 4:16.) But if we take a just view of the
   comparison, it will be found that Matthew has applied this passage to
   Christ correctly, and in its true meaning. Yet it does not appear that
   the view generally given by our commentators is a successful
   elucidation of the passage; for they merely assert that it belongs to
   the kingdom of Christ, but do not assign a reason, or show how it
   accords with this passage. If, therefore, we wish to ascertain the true
   meaning of this passage, we must bring to our recollection what has
   been already stated, that the Prophet, when he speaks of bringing back
   the people from Babylon, does not look to a single age, but includes
   all the rest, till Christ came and brought the most complete
   deliverance to his people. The deliverance from Babylon was but a
   prelude to the restoration of the Church, and was intended to last, not
   for a few years only, but till Christ should come and bring true
   salvation, not only to their bodies, but likewise to their souls. When
   we shall have made a little progress in reading Isaiah, we shall find
   that this was his ordinary custom.

   Having spoken of the captivity in Babylon, which held out the prospect
   of a very heavy calamity, he shows that this calamity will be lighter
   than that which Israel formerly endured; because the Lord had fixed a
   term and limit to that calamity, namely, seventy years, (Jeremiah
   25:11, 12; 29:10,) after the expiration of which the light of the Lord
   would shine on them. By this confident hope of deliverance, therefore,
   he encourages their hearts when overpowered by fear, that they might
   not be distressed beyond measure; and thus he made a distinction
   between the Jews and the Israelites, to whom the expectation of a
   deliverance so near was not promised. Though the Prophets had given to
   the elect remnant some taste of the mercy of God, yet, in consequence
   of the redemption of Israel being, as it were, an addition to the
   redemption of Judah, and dependent on it, justly does the Prophet now
   declare that a new light has been exhibited; because God hath
   determined to redeem his people. Appropriately and skilfully, too, does
   Matthew extend the rays of light to Galilee and the land of Zebulun.
   (Matthew 4:15.)

   In the land of the shadow of death. He now compares the captivity in
   Babylon to darkness and death; for those who were kept there, were
   wretched and miserable, and altogether like dead men; as Ezekiel also
   relates their speech,

   Dead men shall arise out of the graves. (Ezekiel 37:11, 12.)

   Their condition, therefore, was such as if no brightness, no ray of
   light, had shone on them. Yet he shows that this will not prevent them
   from enjoying light, and recovering their former liberty; and that
   liberty he extends, not to a short period, but, as we have already
   said, to the time of Christ.

   Thus it is customary with the Apostles to borrow arguments from the
   Prophets, and to show their real use and design. In this manner Paul
   quotes (Romans 9:25) that passage from Hosea,

   I will call them my people which were not my people,
   (Hosea 2:23,) [140]

   and applies it to the calling of the Gentiles, though strictly it was
   spoken of the Jews; and he shows that it was fulfilled when the Lord
   brought the Gentiles into the Church. Thus, when the people might be
   said to be buried in that captivity, they differed in no respect from
   the Gentiles; and since both were in the same condition, it is
   reasonable to believe that this passage relates, not only to the Jews,
   but to the Gentiles also. Nor must it be viewed as referring to outward
   misery only, but to the darkness of eternal death, in which souls are
   plunged, till they come forth to spiritual light; for unquestionably we
   lie buried in darkness, till Christ shine on us by the doctrine of his
   word. Hence also Paul exhorts,

   Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead,
   and Christ shall give thee light. (Ephesians 5:14.)

   If therefore we extend the commencement of the deliverance from the
   return from Babylon down to the coming of Christ, on whom all liberty
   and all bestowal of blessings depends, we shall understand the true
   meaning of this passage, which otherwise has not been satisfactorily
   explained by commentators.

   3. Thou hast multiplied. This passage is somewhat obscure, both in
   itself, and on account of the diversity of interpretations; for it
   appears to be absurd to say that the joy was not increased, seeing that
   he immediately afterwards adds, they rejoiced. On this account the Jews
   interpret l' (lo) not negatively, but as if v (vau) had been
   substituted for ' (aleph); for sometimes, though rarely, it has this
   meaning in the Scriptures. [141] (Exodus 21:8.) The Jews do this,
   because they cannot reconcile the words of the Prophet with their
   opinion. Again, some view these words as referring to Sennacherib,
   because his army, though it was large, brought him no ground of joy,
   but rather of grief. (2 Kings 19:35.) Others explain it as relating to
   the Church, and justly, but mistake the method of applying it; for they
   think that the Prophet said this because believers, as long as they
   live, are subject to numerous and diversified afflictions. Others go
   still farther from the point, by saying that the conversion of the
   Gentiles, which will enlarge the Church, will not bring joy to the Jews
   and the ancient synagogue.

   But I cannot approve of any of those interpretations, and therefore I
   interpret it in this manner. As the Prophet, in the beginning of the
   chapter, had made a preliminary statement, that this blessing of
   redemption was greater than all other blessings, though it might appear
   to be unworthy of being so highly extolled, on account of the small
   number of those who were redeemed; so now he repeats the same
   comparison, or one not very different from it, namely, that this favor
   of God would be more remarkable than when he had formerly multiplied
   his people. This might at first sight be thought to be highly
   inappropriate; for if we compare the condition of the Jewish kingdom,
   before the Babylonish captivity, with its condition after the return
   from it, we may be led to think that the period during which its
   ancient possession remained unimpaired was a season of greater
   prosperity. It was but a small remnant that returned in comparison of
   that multitude which had been carried away. Besides, they had not the
   free possession of their land, but might be said to be tenants at will;
   and they had to pay tribute to the Persians, and retained hardly any
   semblance of their former rank. Who, therefore, would not have
   preferred that prosperous reign which had been enjoyed by the family of
   David to that condition?

   But the Prophet declares that this latter condition, though it may
   appear to be greatly inferior, and even more wretched, ought to be
   preferred to that which was prosperous and splendid, and shows that it
   will yield greater joy than when they had an abundant share of wealth
   and of all kinds of possessions. This was also testified by Haggai,

   that the glory of the latter temple would be greater
   than the glory of the former, (Haggai 2:9,)

   though at first sight it might appear to be far otherwise. It is as if
   Isaiah had said, "There never was greater joy, though the multitude of
   the people was greater. Though we are few and contemptible in number,
   yet by the light with which thou shinest on us thou hast cheered us to
   such a degree that no joy of our former condition can be compared with
   the present." For that redemption might be regarded as a prelude to the
   full and perfect salvation which was at length obtained through Christ.

   Before thee. He means that the joy was true and complete, not slight or
   temporary. Men often rejoice, but with a deceitful and transitory joy,
   which is followed by mourning and tears. He affirms that this joy has
   its roots so deeply laid, that it can never perish or be destroyed.
   Such is also the import of the phrase before thee; for nothing cheers
   the godly so much as when the face of God shines sweetly on them. They
   are not like irreligious men, who are carried hither and thither by a
   blind and uncertain joy, but they have that which alone gives ground
   for full joy, their reliance on God's fatherly kindness. Perhaps also
   the Prophet intended to allude to those words which frequently occur in
   the writings of Moses: Thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God.
   (Leviticus 23:40; Deuteronomy 12:12,18.) For though the subject there
   spoken of is the Tabernacle, still the mode of expression is fitly
   applied to the present occasion, that the joy of a believing people
   will not be irreligious, but will arise from acknowledging God, and
   beholding him by the eyes of faith to be the author of salvation.
   (Hebrews 5:9.)

   Others explain it more ingeniously, that inwardly believers rejoice
   before God in their consciences, because in the world grief and sighing
   continually awaits them. Though this is true, yet a more natural
   meaning is drawn from the connection of the passage, namely, that
   believers whom God shall redeem will possess true joy; because they
   will have been instructed by undoubted proof that he is their Father,
   so that they may freely boast that they will always be safe under his
   guidance; and, therefore, as I lately mentioned, it denotes
   continuance.

   According to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide
   the spoils. The comparisons of Harvest and Victory, by which he
   heightens the amount of the joy, are sufficiently plain. Now, hence it
   is evident what Christ brings to us, namely, a full and perfect joy, of
   which we cannot in any way be robbed or deprived, though various storms
   and tempests should arise, and though we should be weighed down by
   every kind of afflictions. However weak and feeble we may be, still we
   ought to be glad and joyful; for the ground of our joy does not lie in
   numbers, or wealth, or outward splendor, but in spiritual happiness,
   which we obtain through the word of Christ.

   For thou hast broken his burdensome yoke. He explains the cause of the
   joy, that believers, when they have been delivered from a frightful and
   cruel tyranny, will feel as if they had been rescued from death. In
   order to illustrate the grace of God, he reminds them how shameful and
   burdensome was the slavery with which the Jews had been oppressed and
   afflicted; and this is his object in heaping up the expressions, the
   yoke of the shoulder, the staff of the shoulder, the rod of the
   oppressor or overseer. Whatever may be our excessive effeminacy or
   cowardice, while we actually feel afflictions, yet as soon as they are
   gone, we easily come to forget them. That the redeemed people may not
   think lightly of the favor of God, the Prophet bids them consider how
   bitter and mournful was the slavery, when they groaned under a heavy
   yoke or triumphal car, when the staff was laid on their shoulders, and
   they were oppressed by tyrannical rule; and therefore their deliverance
   ought justly to make them more glad and joyful.

   Next, he extolls the excellence of this favor on another ground, that
   God has openly displayed his hand from heaven. For this purpose he
   adduces an ancient and memorable instance. As God had formerly
   overthrown the Midianites, without the help of men, by a wonderful and
   amazing method, (Judges 7:21,) so now there will be a similar and
   illustrious display of power; for God will deliver his people from a
   cruel tyranny, when not one of the wretched Jews will venture to lift a
   finger. Now, it ought to be observed that God sometimes assists his
   people in such a manner as to make use of ordinary methods; but when he
   sees that this hinders men from beholding his hand, which may be said
   to be concealed, he sometimes works alone, and by evident miracles,
   that nothing may prevent or obscure the manifestation of his power.
   Thus in this victory of Gideon, when the enemies were routed without
   any agency of men, the arm of God openly appeared. For what had Gideon
   but the noise of pitchers, which could scarcely have driven away mice,
   and a small band of men, against a vast army, and, instead of weapons,
   a useless scarecrow? To this deliverance, therefore, he compares the
   future deliverance of the people, in which the hand of God will be not
   less openly and illustriously displayed.

   Some explain this passage as relating merely to the law, which might
   not inappropriately have been called a burdensome yoke, and a rod lying
   on the shoulders. But that interpretation is unsuitable; for it would
   give to the Prophet the appearance of having suddenly broken off from
   his subject, and would be a violent torture of this passage. We must
   therefore attend to that arrangement which I formerly noticed, namely,
   that when God brought his people out of Babylon, he continued that
   blessing of deliverance till Christ. The meaning therefore is, "Thou
   hast broken those burdens by which thy people were unjustly and cruelly
   oppressed."

   Others apply it to the destruction of Jerusalem during the reign of
   Vespasian, but they have no argument on their side. Almost all the Jews
   refer it to Hezekiah, when in this manner the Lord delivered the city
   from the siege of Sennacherib, and cut off his army. (2 Kings 19:35;
   Isaiah 37:36.) But that interpretation could not be admitted, for
   Hezekiah did not reign tyrannically over the Jews. Besides, at that
   time the Lord rescued the people from fear and danger, and not from
   slavery. Hence it is evident that this prediction had a more distant
   object, and that the interpretation which I have given to this passage
   is just and reasonable.

   5. For every battle. Here commentators are nearly agreed that Isaiah
   intended to contrast the victory which God was about to give to his
   people with other victories. Others conquer by making a great slaughter
   of the enemies, but here the Lord will conquer by his own hand alone.
   He expresses more fully what he had said, As in the day of Midian.
   (Verse 4.) The Lord therefore, he says, will not employ the agency of a
   great multitude, but will achieve a victory for himself from heaven.
   When the Lord acts by himself, every covering is removed, and we
   perceive more clearly that he is the Author of our life and salvation.

   Now, since there is a contrast which expresses the difference between
   the ordinary mode of warfare and the miracle of redemption, the
   copulative v, (vau,) in the middle of the verse, ought to be rendered
   but; as if he had said, that it is usually amidst the confusion of the
   battle that enemies are hewn down: but God will act in a very different
   manner; for he will destroy the enemies of the Church, as if he sent
   down lightning from heaven, or suddenly struck them by thunderbolts. It
   may perhaps be thought better to adopt the opinion of those who explain
   the second clause as a continuation of the first, that all warriors
   will be with trembling and with burning fire. But the former meaning is
   more appropriate, and is likewise supported by the words of the
   Prophet. Hence it is evident that the present subject is not merely the
   deliverance which the people obtained from Cyrus, permitting them to
   return to their native country, but that these words must be viewed as
   extending to the kingdom of Christ.

   6. For unto us a child is born. Isaiah now argues from the design, to
   show why this deliverance ought to be preferred to the rest of God's
   benefits, namely, because not only will God bring back the people from
   captivity, but he will place Christ on his royal throne, that under him
   supreme and everlasting happiness may be enjoyed. Thus he affirms that
   the kindness of God will not be temporary, for it includes the whole of
   that intermediate period during which the Church was preserved till the
   coming of Christ. Nor is it wonderful if the Prophet makes a sudden
   transition from the return of the ancient people to the full
   restoration of the Church, which took place many centuries afterwards;
   for in our observations on Isaiah 7:14, [142] we have remarked, that
   there being no other way that God is reconciled to us than through the
   Mediator, all the promises are founded on him; and that on this account
   it is customary with the Prophets, whenever they wish to encourage the
   hearts of believers by good hope, to bring this forward as a pledge or
   earnest. To this must be added, that the return from the captivity in
   Babylon was the commencement of the renovation of the Church, which was
   completed when Christ appeared; and consequently there is no absurdity
   in an uninterrupted succession. Justly, therefore, does Isaiah teach
   that they ought not to confine their attention to the present benefit,
   but should consider the end, and refer everything to it. "This is your
   highest happiness, that you have been rescued from death, not only that
   you may live in the land of Canaan, but that you may arrive at the
   kingdom of God."

   Hence we learn that we ought not to swallow up the benefits which we
   receive from God, so as instantly to forget them, but should raise our
   minds to Christ, otherwise the advantage will be small, and the joy
   will be transitory; because they will not lead us to taste the
   sweetness of a Father's love, unless we keep in remembrance the free
   election of God, which is ratified in Christ. In short, the Prophet
   does not wish that this people should be wholly occupied with the joy
   occasioned by the outward and short-lived freedom which they had
   obtained, but that they should look at the end, that is, at the
   preservation of the Church, till Christ, the only Redeemer, should
   appear; for he ought to be the ground and perfection of all our joy.

   A child is born. The Jews impudently torture this passage, for they
   interpret it as relating to Hezekiah, though he had been born before
   this prediction was uttered. But he speaks of it as something new and
   unexpected; and it is even a promise, intended to arouse believers to
   the expectation of a future event; and therefore there can be no
   hesitation in concluding that he describes a child that was afterwards
   to be born

   He is called the Son of God. Although in the Hebrew language the word
   son, I admit, has a wide acceptation, yet that is when something is
   added to it. Every man is the son of his father: those who are a
   hundred years old are called (Isaiah 65:20) the sons of a hundred
   years; wicked men are called the sons of wickedness; those who are
   blessed are called the sons of blessing; and Isaiah called a fruitful
   hill the son of fatness. (Isaiah 5:1.) But son, without any addition,
   can mean none else than the Son of God; and it is now ascribed to
   Christ, by way of eminence, (kat ' exochen,) in order to inform us,
   that by this striking mark he is distinguished from the rest of
   mankind. Nor can it be doubted that Isaiah referred to that well-known
   prediction, which was in the mouth of every person,

   I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son,
   (2 Samuel 7:14,)

   as it is afterwards repeated,

   Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
   (Psalm 2:7.)

   Had it not been commonly and generally known that the Messiah would be
   the Son of God, it would have been foolish and unmeaning for Isaiah
   simply to call him the Son. Accordingly, this title is derived from the
   former prediction, from which the Apostle reasons, that the excellence
   of Christ exalts him above all the angels. (Hebrews 1:5.)

   Now, though in the person of a child Christ might have a mean
   appearance, still the designation of Son points out his high rank. Yet
   I do not deny that he might have been called the Son of David, but it
   is more natural to apply it to him as God. The titles which follow are
   still less applicable to Hezekiah. I shall soon give an ample
   refutation of the sophistry by which the Jews attempt to evade this
   passage. Let them slander as they may, the matter is sufficient plain
   to all who will calmly and soberly examine it.

   A Son hath been given to us. There is weight in what he now adds, that
   this Son was given to the people, in order to inform the Jews that
   their salvation and that of the whole Church is contained in the person
   of Christ. And this giving is one of the chief articles of our faith;
   for it would have been of little avail to us, that Christ was born, if
   he had not likewise been our own. What this child will be, and what is
   his rank, he declares in the following statements.

   And the government hath been laid upon his shoulder. To suppose, as
   some do, that this is an allusion to the cross of Christ is manifestly
   childish. Christ carried the cross on his shoulders, (John 19:17,) and
   by the cross he gained a splendid triumph over the prince of this
   world. (John 14:30.) But as the government is here said to have been
   laid on his shoulders in the same sense in which we shall see that the
   key of the house of David was laid on the shoulders of Eliakim, (Isaiah
   22:22,) we need not go far to seek ingenious expositions. Yet I agree
   with those who think that there is an indirect contrast between the
   government which the Redeemer bore on his shoulders and the staff of
   the shoulder which was just now mentioned; for it agrees well, and is
   not liable to any objections. He therefore shows that the Messiah will
   be different from indolent kings, who leave off business and cares, and
   live at their ease; for he will be able to bear the burden Thus he
   asserts the superiority and grandeur of his government, because by his
   own power Christ will obtain homage to himself, and he will discharge
   his office, not only with the tips of his fingers, but with his full
   strength.

   And his name shall be called. Though yqr', (yikra,) he shall call, be
   an active verb, I have not hesitated to translate it in a passive
   sense; for the meaning is the same as if he had made use of the plural
   number, they shall call. We have a French idiom that resembles it, on
   appellera, literally, one shall call, that is, he shall be called. The
   Jews apply it to God, and read it continuously, he shall call his name
   Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the
   Prince of Peace. But it is very evident that this proceeds from a
   desire, or rather from a licentious eagerness, to obscure the glory of
   Christ; for if they had not labored with excessive keenness to rob him
   of his Godhead, the passage would run on very smoothly as interpreted
   by our divines. Besides, what necessity was there for ascribing to God
   those attributes, if the Prophet meant nothing more than that God gave
   a name to Messiah? For the attributes which are usually ascribed to God
   are either perpetual or accommodated to the case in hand, neither of
   which suppositions can here be admitted. Again, it would have been an
   interruption of the regular order to insert the name of God in the
   midst of various titles, but it ought to have run thus, the mighty God,
   Wonderful, Counsellor, shall call. Now, I do not see how the name yvts
   (yognetz) can be applied absolutely to God, for it belongs to
   counsellors who attend kings or other persons. If any obstinate
   wrangler shall contend for the notion of the Rabbins, he will show
   nothing but his own impudence. Let us follow the plain and natural
   meaning.

   Wonderful. It ought to be observed that those titles are not foreign to
   the subject, but are adapted to the case in hand, for the Prophet
   describes what Christ will show himself to be towards believers. He
   does not speak of Christ's mysterious essence, but applauds his
   excellencies, which we perceive and experience by faith. This ought to
   be the more carefully considered, because the greater part of men are
   satisfied with his mere name, and do not observe his power and energy,
   though that ought to be chiefly regarded.

   By the first title he arouses the minds of the godly to earnest
   attention, that they may expect from Christ something more excellent
   than what we see in the ordinary course of God's works, as if he had
   said, that in Christ are hidden the invaluable treasures of wonderful
   things. (Colossians 2:3.) And, indeed, the redemption which he has
   brought surpasses even the creation of the world. It amounts to this,
   that the grace of God, which will be exhibited in Christ, exceeds all
   miracles.

   Counselor. The reason of this second title is, that the Redeemer will
   come endowed with absolute wisdom. Now, let us remember what I have
   just noticed, that the Prophet does not here reason about the hidden
   essence of Christ, but about the power which he displays towards us. It
   is not, therefore, because he knows all his Father's secrets that the
   Prophet calls him Counsellor, but rather because, proceeding from the
   bosom of the Father, (John 1:18,) he is in every respect the highest
   and most perfect teacher. In like manner we are not permitted to get
   wisdom but from his Gospel, and this contributes also to the praise of
   the Gospel, for it contains the perfect wisdom of God, as Paul
   frequently shows. (1 Corinthians 1:24, 30; Ephesians 1:17; Colossians
   1:9.) All that is necessary for salvation is opened up by Christ in
   such a manner, and explained with such familiarity, that he addresses
   the disciples no longer as servants but as friends. (John 15:14, 15.)

   The mighty God. 'l (El) is one of the names of God, though derived from
   strength, so that it is sometimes added as an attribute. But here it is
   evidently a proper name, because Isaiah is not satisfied with it, and
   in addition to it employs the adjective gvvr, (gibbor,) which means
   strong. And indeed if Christ had not been God, it would have been
   unlawful to glory in him; for it is written,

   Cursed be he that trusteth in man. (Jeremiah 17:5.)

   We must, therefore, meet with the majesty of God in him, so that there
   truly dwells in him that which cannot without sacrilege be attributed
   to a creature.

   He is, therefore, called the mighty God, for the same reason that he
   was formerly called Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14.) For if we find in Christ
   nothing but the flesh and nature of man, our glorying will be foolish
   and vain, and our hope will rest on au uncertain and insecure
   foundation; but if he shows himself to be to us God and the mighty God,
   we may now rely on him with safety. With good reason does he call him
   strong or mighty, because our contest is with the devil, death, and
   sin, (Ephesians 6:12,) enemies too powerful and strong, by whom we
   would be immediately vanquished, if the strength of Christ had not
   rendered us invincible. Thus we learn from this title that there is in
   Christ abundance of protection for defending our salvation, so that we
   desire nothing beyond him; for he is God, who is pleased to show
   himself strong on our behalf. This application may be regarded as the
   key to this and similar passages, leading us to distinguish between
   Christ's mysterious essence and the power by which he hath revealed
   himself to us.

   The father of the age. The Greek translator has added mellontos future;
   [143] and, in my opinion, the translation is correct, for it denotes
   eternity, unless it be thought better to view it as denoting "perpetual
   duration," or "an endless succession of ages," lest any one should
   improperly limit it to the heavenly life, which is still hidden from
   us. (Colossians 3:3.) True, the Prophet includes it, and even declares
   that Christ will come, in order to bestow immortality on his people;
   but as believers, even in this world, pass from death to life, (John
   5:24; 1 John 3:14,) this world is embraced by the eternal condition of
   the Church.

   The name Father is put for Author, because Christ preserves the
   existence of his Church through all ages, and bestows immortality on
   the body and on the individual members. Hence we conclude how
   transitory our condition is, apart from him; for, granting that we were
   to live for a very long period after the ordinary manner of men, what
   after all will be the value of our long life? We ought, therefore, to
   elevate our minds to that blessed and everlasting life, which as yet we
   see not, but which we possess by hope and faith. (Romans 8:25.)

   The Prince of Peace. This is the last title, and the Prophet declares
   by it that the coming of Christ will be the cause of full and perfect
   happiness, or, at least, of calm and blessed safety. In the Hebrew
   language peace often signifies prosperity, for of all blessings not one
   is better or more desirable than peace. The general meaning is, that
   all who submit to the dominion of Christ will lead a quiet and blessed
   life in obedience to him. Hence it follows that life, without this
   King, is restless and miserable.

   But we must also take into consideration the nature of this peace. It
   is the same with that of the kingdom, for it resides chiefly in the
   consciences; otherwise we must be engaged in incessant conflicts and
   liable to daily attacks. Not only, therefore, does he promise outward
   peace, but that peace by which we return to a state of favor with God,
   who were formerly at enmity with him. Justified by faith, says Paul, we
   have peace with God. (Romans 5:1.) Now, when Christ shall have brought
   composure to our minds, the same spiritual peace will hold the highest
   place in our hearts, (Philippians 4:7; Colossians 3:15,) so that we
   will patiently endure every kind of adversity, and from the same
   fountain will likewise flow outward prosperity, which is nothing else
   than the effect of the blessing of God.

   Now, to apply this for our own instruction, whenever any distrust
   arises, and all means of escape are taken away from us, whenever, in
   short, it appears to us that everything is in a ruinous condition, let
   us recall to our remembrance that Christ is called Wonderful, because
   he has inconceivable methods of assisting us, and because his power is
   far beyond what we are able to conceive. When we need counsel, let us
   remember that he is the Counsellor. When we need strength, let us
   remember that he is Mighty and Strong. When new terrors spring up
   suddenly every instant, and when many deaths threaten us from various
   quarters, let us rely on that eternity of which he is with good reason
   called the Father, and by the same comfort let us learn to soothe all
   temporal distresses. When we are inwardly tossed by various tempests,
   and when Satan attempts to disturb our consciences, let us remember
   that Christ is The Prince of Peace, and that it is easy for him quickly
   to allay all our uneasy feelings. Thus will these titles confirm us
   more and more in the faith of Christ, and fortify us against Satan and
   against hell itself.

   7. To the increase of the government there will be no end. He begins to
   explain and confirm what he had formerly said, that Christ is The
   Prince of Peace, by saying that his government is extended to every
   age, and is perpetual; that there will be no end to the government or
   to peace. This was also repeated by Daniel, who predicts that his
   kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. (Daniel 7:27.) Gabriel also alluded
   to it when he carried the message to the virgin; and he gave the true
   exposition of this passage, for it cannot be understood to refer to any
   other than to Christ.

   He shall reign, says he, over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his
   kingdom there shall be no end. (Luke 1:33.)

   We see that the mightiest governments of this world, as if they had
   been built on a slippery foundation, (Psalm 73:18,) are unexpectedly
   overturned and suddenly fall. How fickle and changeable all the
   kingdoms under heaven are, we learn from history and from daily
   examples. This government alone is unchangeable and eternal.

   Now, this continuance, of which Isaiah now speaks, consists of two
   parts. It belongs both to time and to quality. Though the kingdom of
   Christ is in such a condition that it appears as if it were about to
   perish at every moment, yet God not only protects and defends it, but
   also extends its boundaries far and wide, and then preserves and
   carries it forward in uninterrupted progression to eternity. We ought
   firmly to believe this, that the frequency of those shocks by which the
   Church is shaken may not weaken our faith, when we learn that, amidst
   the mad outcry and violent attacks of enemies, the kingdom of Christ
   stands firm through the invincible power of God, so that, though the
   whole world should oppose and resist, it will remain through all ages.
   We must not judge of its stability from the present appearances of
   things, but from the promise, which assures us of its continuance and
   of its constant increase.

   And to the peace. To the government he adds the eternity of the peace,
   for the one cannot be separated from the other. It is impossible that
   Christ should be King without also keeping his people in calm and
   blessed peace, and enriching them with every blessing. But as they are
   daily exposed to innumerable vexations, endure fierce attacks, and are
   tossed and perplexed by fears and anxieties, they ought to cultivate
   that peace of Christ, which holds the highest place in their hearts,
   (Philippians 4:7; Colossians 3:15,) that they may remain unhurt, and
   may even retain their composure amidst the destruction of the whole
   world.

   In the word lmrvh, (lemarbeh,) contrary to the usual manner of writing,
   there is the close form of m (mem). [144] Some think that it denotes
   the slavery by which the Jewish people should be oppressed till the
   coming of Christ. Others think that that nation, on account of its
   treachery, was excluded by this mark from having any share in this
   kingdom. I do not find fault with these views. Indeed, we can hardly
   assert that the Prophet wrote it in this manner; but yet, since this is
   the form in which it has come into our hands, and since the Rabbins
   were so close observers of the minutest portion of a letter, we cannot
   avoid thinking that this was not rashly done. And if we admit that the
   Prophet intentionally wrote it in this manner, I think that it conveyed
   this useful instruction, that believers should not imagine that the
   splendor of Christ's kingdom would consist in outward pomp, or cherish
   vain hopes of worldly triumphs, but should only expect, amidst various
   calamities, an unseen extension of the kingdom, because it had been
   promised.

   Upon the throne of David. A promise having been made to David that the
   Redeemer would spring from his seed, (2 Samuel 7:12,13,) and his
   kingdom having been nothing else than an image or faint shadow of that
   more perfect and truly blessed state which God had determined to
   establish by the hand of his Son, the Prophets, in order to remind the
   people of that remarkable miracle, usually call Christ the Son of
   David. (Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15.) Though the name of such a holy and
   upright king was justly beloved and revered, yet believers esteemed
   more highly the promised restoration to full salvation, and even among
   the most ignorant persons that prediction was universally remembered,
   and its truth and authenticity were considered to be clear and
   undoubted. I shall collect but a few of the passages in which the
   Prophets promise to an afflicted people restoration in the person of
   David or of his Son. (Jeremiah 30:9; Ezekiel 34:23; 37:24; Hosea 3:5.)
   Sometimes they foretell that David, who was already dead, would be
   king. In like manner Isaiah, in this passage, intimates that he brings
   forward nothing that is new, but only reminds them of that which God
   had formerly promised about the perpetuity of the kingdom. Indirectly
   also he insinuates what Amoz more plainly states, that Christ will

   again raise up the throne which for some time had been fallen. (Amos
   9:11.)

   To order it, and to establish it with judgment and with righteousness.
   He describes the quality of the kingdom, but by a comparison drawn from
   earthly governments; for he says that Christ will be a King, to order
   and establish his kingdom with judgment and with righteousness. These
   are the means by which earthly governments prosper and take deep roots;
   but those which are only administered by fear and violence cannot be
   lasting. Since, therefore, justice is the best guardian of kingdoms and
   governments, and since the happiness of the whole of the people depends
   on it, by this clause Isaiah shows that the kingdom of Christ will be
   the model of the best kind of government.

   Judgment and righteousness do not here relate to outward affairs of
   state. We must observe the analogy between the kingdom of Christ and
   its qualities; for, being spiritual, it is established by the power of
   the Holy Spirit. In a word, all these things must be viewed as
   referring to the inner man, that is, when we are regenerated by God to
   true righteousness. Outward righteousness indeed follows afterwards,
   but it must be preceded by that renovation of the mind and heart. We
   are not Christ's, therefore, unless we follow what is good and just,
   and bear on our hearts the impress of that righteousness which hath
   been sealed by the Holy Spirit.

   Henceforth even for ever. This must be understood, I think, to refer to
   the perpetuity of righteousness and doctrine rather than of the
   kingdom, lest we should imagine that his laws resemble the statutes of
   kings and princes, which are in force for three days, or for a short
   period, and are continually renewed, and soon become old again, but
   that we may know that their obligation is everlasting; for they have
   been established, as Zecharias says,

   that we may serve him in holiness and righteousness all the days of our
   life. (Luke 1:74, 75.)

   As Christ's kingdom is everlasting, because he dieth no more, (Romans
   6:9,) so it follows that righteousness and judgment will be
   everlasting, for they cannot be changed by any length of time.

   The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. By zeal I understand
   that ardent desire which God will display in preserving his Church, by
   removing all difficulties and obstructions which might otherwise have
   hindered its redemption. When we engage in any difficult undertaking,
   our earnestness, and the warmth of our feelings, overcome the
   difficulties which present themselves to baffle or retard our attempts.
   In like manner Isaiah shows that God is inflamed with an uncommon and
   extraordinary desire to promote the salvation of the Church, so that if
   believers cannot measure by their own capacity what he has just now
   promised, still they ought not to cease to entertain confident hope,
   for the manner of it is wonderful and inconceivable. In short, he
   intimates that God will come with no light or slow arm to redeem his
   Church, for he will be all on flame with amazing love of believers, and
   anxiety about their salvation.

   8. The Lord hath sent a word. Here he relates a new prediction, for I
   think that this discourse is separated from the former, because the
   Prophet now returns to speak of the future condition of the kingdom of
   Israel, which was at that time hostile to the Jews. Now, we know that
   the Jews had good reason for being alarmed at the forces and power of
   that kingdom, especially when it had made a league with the Syrians,
   because they saw that they had not sufficient strength to oppose them.
   In order, therefore, to yield comfort to the godly, he shows what will
   be the future condition of the kingdom of Israel

   By Jacob and Israel he means the same thing; but the diversity of
   expression is elegant, and is intended to show that the wicked gain
   nothing by their opposition, when they endeavor either to turn away
   from them, or to alter the judgment of God. He alludes to the speech of
   those who think that they can escape by means of their witticisms, and
   who turn into jest and sport all that is threatened by the Prophets;
   just as if one were to attempt to drive away a storm by the breath of
   his mouth. It is, therefore, an ironical admission, as if he had said,
   "In your opinion, what God pronounces against you will fall on others;
   but all the threatenings which he utters against Jacob will light upon
   Israel."

   To send means to appoint. The preposition v (beth) means in Jacob
   himself. The word of God must dwell and rest in him, for it cannot
   vanish away without producing any effect. This is what he afterwards
   lays down in other words, "My word shall not return to me void; that
   is, because it is an effectual publication of that which I have once
   decreed." (Isaiah 55:11.) By the word, it hath fallen, [145] he points
   out the certainty of the effect and result; as if he had said, "I do
   not conjecture these things, nor do I contrive them out of my own head;
   but God hath spoken, who cannot be deceived, and cannot change."

   9. And the people shall know. By the word people I understand, not the
   Jews, but rather the Israelites; and, indeed, the Prophet removes doubt
   by expressly naming Ephraim. He likewise adds Samaria, which was the
   metropolis of that people, or of the ten tribes; for fortified cities,
   conceiving themselves to be placed beyond the reach of danger, are much
   more insolent in their pretensions. They think that they will always
   have the remedy in their hands by capitulating with the enemy, though
   the whole country were laid waste. On this account Isaiah threatens
   that they will not be exempted from the general calamity. He says that
   all will feel that the predictions which were uttered by the mouth of
   God will not be without effect. By the word know, which relates to
   actual experience, he indirectly reproves their unbelief; as if he had
   said, "Since I speak to the deaf, and you set no value on the warnings
   which I now address to you, the actual event will teach you, but too
   late."

   Who say. Here the Prophet attacks the obstinacy and rebellion of that
   people, because, though they had once and again been chastised by God's
   scourges, and that sharply, they were so far from repentance that they
   reckoned their losses to be gain, and became more hardened. Assuredly
   they who thus insolently mock at God are not brought to obedience
   without being reduced to utter weakness. Now, such an insult openly and
   avowedly provokes God's anger, and therefore the Prophet says that it
   proceeds from the haughtiness and pride of the heart. Hence it follows
   that it is right to apply to knotty timber chisels that are harder
   still.

   10. The bricks are fallen down. These are the words of men who were
   obstinate, and who despised the calamity which they had sustained, as
   if it had been of advantage to them, because it afforded them an
   opportunity of adorning with greater splendor both their houses and
   their fields. "We shall build," they say, "more magnificently. The
   brick houses have been thrown down that we may dwell in splendid
   palaces; and since the trees have been cut down, we shall plant more
   fruitful ones." This was not the fault of a single age, for at this day
   we see the same obstinacy in the world. How many are the distresses
   with which Europe has been afflicted for thirty or forty years? How
   many are the chastisements by which she has been called to repentance?
   And yet it does not appear that those numerous chastisements have done
   any good. On the contrary, luxury increases every day, lawless passions
   are inflamed, and men go on in crimes and profligacy more shamelessly
   than ever. In short, those very calamities appear to have been so many
   excitements to luxury and splendor. What then should we expect but to
   be bruised with heavier blows?

   11. But the Lord will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him. The
   Israelites having been proud of their alliance with the king of Syria,
   and hoping that everything would succeed to their wish, Isaiah
   threatens a new change which will take away all their hope and utterly
   frustrate their designs, for the Assyrians afterwards took arms and
   waged war with the Syrians. Accordingly, when Rezin had been slain, (2
   Kings 16:9,) that country was entirely ruined. Still more does he
   heighten this, by adding, he shall mingle; [146] for he means that the
   Lord will gather together and mingle various enemies whom he will
   commission to destroy the king of Syria, as the soldiers who composed
   the army of that vast monarchy were collected out of various nations.

   12. Syria in front. [147] The Prophet shows what will be the nature of
   this change, and what will happen after the death of Rezin, (2 Kings
   16:9,) who had allied himself with Israel against Judah; namely, that
   the Syrians, after the death of their king, from being allies will
   suddenly become enemies, and will make war against Israel, which took
   place. (2 Kings 17:3.) This is what he means when he says that Syria
   will be in front; for I do not agree with those expositors who make
   Syria to mean "those on the East," and the Philistines "those on the
   West." A more natural meaning is, that the enemies will invade them on
   every side; because on all sides they who had been regarded as faithful
   friends will rise up to destroy them. The phrases in front and behind
   agree with the ordinary modes of speaking, so that we ought not to seek
   an interpretation that is new and foreign to the purpose.

   From this example we ought to learn what it is to rely on human power
   and the alliances of kings, and especially when, in consequence of
   being entangled by unlawful covenants, we become careless and fall
   asleep; for as soon as the Lord pleases, they who were formerly on our
   side will, in the smallest portion of time, be turned against us to our
   ruin; and remedies, which we thought would be useful to us will prove
   to be our destruction, and will assist us both before and behind. We
   ought also to observe that God does not all at once expend all his
   scourges, but when we proceed obstinately, and provoke him more and
   more, he increases and multiplies the chastisements, and still inflicts
   a new kind of punishment, till at length he subdues our obstinacy and
   rebellion.

   And will devour Israel with the whole mouth. [148] The phrase with the
   whole mouth, [149] is equivalent to an ordinary idiom of our own, (a
   pleine bouche,) with full mouth. As if he had said, "Israel will be
   exposed as a prey to her enemies, so that on every hand she will be
   devoured with open mouth, both by the Syrians and by the Philistines."

   His anger is not turned away. This is the severest of all, and beyond
   everything else ought to have terrified the ungodly, that if they had
   suffered much, they have more to endure; that new punishments
   continually await them, because by going on in their obstinacy they
   inflame still more the wrath of God. Men take this as an incentive to
   more obstinate and determined wickedness, that, having suffered some
   punishment, they think that they have nothing more to suffer, and
   become more hardened. They do not even believe that they are any longer
   exposed to the judgment of God, who has already spent his rods; and as
   if they were altogether out of his power, they give themselves greater
   indulgence, and shake off every yoke.

   But his hand is stretched out still. What we have now stated is the
   reason why Isaiah threatens that the hand of the Lord is still
   stretched out, that they may not think that they have escaped that
   hand. Now, this is said not for the purpose of instructing, but of
   accusing, though the threatenings have also a tendency to make doctrine
   better understood; but as he had to do with obstinate men, on whom no
   chastisement produced any good effect, he therefore announces that the
   chastisements are not yet at an end; and that, although God has for a
   time discontinued those chastisements, still he has not dispensed with
   them, but has his hand lifted up to inflict a new wound.

   13. But the people hath not turned. [150] The copulative v (vau) is
   rendered by some interpreters for, as if the Prophet were assigning a
   reason why the Lord does not cease to employ his scourges in the
   continual infliction of chastisements; that is, because the people are
   so hardened and obstinate that they will not repent. When there is no
   repentance, it is unreasonable to expect that God will yield to
   obstinate men, as if he were vanquished; and the consequence is, that
   he prepares himself for inflicting severer punishment. Since,
   therefore, no chastisements had produced any amendment in Israel, he
   must perish; for when they had been so frequently struck and punished,
   and did not at all repent, this was a proof of the most desperate
   wickedness.

   This is a very severe rebuke, that although the Lord not only
   admonishes us by words, but actually pushes us forward, and constrains
   us by various chastisements, still we grow hardened, and do not suffer
   ourselves to be drawn away from our crimes and our lusts. Desperate
   wickedness is thus evinced, and nothing more heinous could be spoken or
   conceived. It is a heinous offense, when men do not receive instruction
   as soon as it is delivered to them; it is more heinous, when they are
   not affected by rebukes; it is the most heinous of all, when, in spite
   even of chastisements, they grow hardened, and even kick, or by their
   headstrong behavior inflame still more the indignation of the Judge,
   and do not consider why they were punished, or what it is to which the
   Lord calls them. Accordingly, when no remedies produce any good effect,
   what must we think but that the disease is incurable and utterly
   desperate?

   This rebuke applies not to the Israelites only but to us also. Already
   hath the Lord chastised the whole world by various afflictions, so that
   hardly any part could be exempted from distresses and calamities. And
   yet all appear to have obstinately conspired against God, so that,
   whatever He does, they cease not to retain their former character, and
   to carry on their wicked courses. Justly, therefore, might the Lord
   address to us the same expostulation, and assuredly he addresses us by
   the mouth of Isaiah; and we ought not to look for another Prophet to
   threaten new chastisements, seeing that our case is not different from
   that of the Israelites, and we are involved in the same blame with
   them.

   Nor have they sought the Lord of hosts. This is immediately added as an
   explanation, for the reason why God inflicts punishment is, to bring
   back the wanderers to himself. By this method, indeed, he appears to
   drive men to a greater distance from him; but as it belongs to him to
   bring out of the grave those whom he appeared to have wounded and
   slain, by terrifying sinners he only humbles them, in order that they
   may return to him. And indeed the beginning of conversion is to seek
   God, or rather it is the only rule of living well; if we turn aside
   from it we have no rest for the sole of our foot. But we must now
   inquire what it is to seek God, or in what manner we ought to seek him;
   for hypocrites will always be ready to plead, that by prayers and
   fastings, and tears, and a sorrowful countenance, they earnestly
   entreat God and implore forgiveness. But God chooses to be sought in
   another manner; that is, when the sinner truly subdued, willingly takes
   the yoke which he had shaken off, and yields obedience to him whom he
   had despised.

   14. Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel. He intimates that
   God's vengeance will be universal, and will involve all ranks; for the
   whole nation was corrupted, and the contagion had spread over the whole
   country, to such an extent that no part was left whole or sound. Now,
   when iniquity thus abounds, every one flatters himself, and they think
   that they have concealed themselves by an admirable veil, because they
   have many who are like them; and when they compare themselves with
   others, they think that they have pleaded their excuse. This is the
   reason why he threatens that vengeance generally against all; for not
   one was free from the general disease.

   Head and tail, branch and reed. [151] By branch he means the stronger
   and more powerful; by reed or rush he means the feebler, that is, men
   of the lowest rank, and who had scarcely any wealth. He therefore means
   that the vengeance of God hangs over them, and spares neither the
   strong nor the weak, neither the highest nor the lowest, because no
   part is sound or uninfected by the general disease.

   15. The ancient and honorable, he is the head. What he had spoken
   allegorically about the head and the tail he explains more plainly and
   without a figure. He says that the heads are the princes and nobles who
   had the charge of public affairs, and sat at the helm of the
   commonwealth. To these he adds the false prophets, and says that they
   are meant by the tail. But he explains only the first part of the
   verse, and says nothing about the branch and reed. The reason why he
   omitted them is easily explained. It is, because he intended to press
   hardest on those who were more heinous transgressors, and who led
   others to commit sin, in consequence of the influence which they
   obtained from their high rank. He gives to the prophets the name of the
   tail, not because they were mean and contemptible, as some think; but
   he intended to denote the lowest parts of the whole body. By the head
   he means magistrates and judges, and by the tail he means false
   prophets, because they deceive and impose upon men by falsehoods and
   hypocrisy, as if he had compared the one to lions or bears, and the
   other to foxes.

   This passage warns us that we ought not to slumber in our sins, because
   wickedness and profligacy abound in all ranks, and no class of men is
   sound or uninfected; for the more that vices abound, so much the more
   will the wrath of God be kindled against the highest and the lowest. We
   ought, especially in the present day, amidst that pestilence of every
   kind of evils, to fear lest, when the wrath of God hath begun to burn,
   it may consume everything, high and low.

   16. For the rulers of this people are seducers. [152] Some render it,
   they who make thee blessed, or, they who call thee blessed; as if he
   had said that nothing was more hurtful or destructive to a nation than
   flatteries, which gave encouragement to unbounded licentiousness. But I
   shall follow the reading which I approved on a former occasion, when
   the same word occurred. [153] (Isaiah 3:12.) He means that the rulers
   and magistrates, whose duty it was to restrain the people within the
   limits of decent behavior, allowed all to indulge freely in crimes and
   wickedness. On this account they ought justly to be reckoned seducers
   and corrupters, for corruption flows from them to the whole body of the
   people, as from the head to the members. Magistrates and pastors are
   appointed in order to restrain the waywardness of the people, to enjoin
   what is good and right, and especially to defend the honor of God. If
   they neglect these duties they ought to be reckoned impostors and not
   rulers, for they give rise to miserable confusion. Now, when every one
   does what he pleases, and the reins of government are nowhere to be
   found, can there be anything but the most terrible result? When the
   common people are thus punished on account of their faults, no lighter
   vengeance awaits the rulers, because they have neglected the duty
   entrusted to them, and have occasioned so many evils.

   And they who are governed are destroyed. By this clause he means that
   wicked princes, and those who rule according to their own caprice, are
   destructive; and in like manner teachers who rather deceive and impose
   on men than point out the way of salvation, because through their fault
   the people are ruined. But at the same time he shows that this affords
   no excuse to any one for seeking to make bad rulers a cloak for their
   own transgressions, as is commonly done, for if the blind lead the
   blind, as Christ says, both will fall into the ditch. It is certain
   that none are ruined by wicked and treacherous leaders, but those who
   of their own accord wish to be led astray.

   17. Therefore the LORD will not delight in their young men. Isaiah
   describes more clearly how dreadful will be that vengeance of God
   against all ranks; for so far will more flagrant transgressors be from
   escaping, that neither boys nor youths, nor widows, will be exempted,
   who are usually spared even amidst dreadful slaughter; which was
   usually done even among heathens at the sacking of towns, as we learn
   from history. But here the Lord threatens that he will pay no regard
   either to sex or to age. Yet the following view will not be unsuitable.
   "Although the carnage will rob many women of their husbands, and will
   deprive many children of their parents, still God will not shrink from
   punishing women by making them widows, and children by making them
   orphans." But as it does not greatly affect the general meaning, I do
   not dwell upon it. Again, that they may not accuse God of cruelty, he
   at the same time shows that there are good reasons why he is so severe,
   because they are all wicked, and therefore that they deserve to be cast
   headlong to ruin without any distinction.

   For all are hypocrites and evil-doers. As to this word, I was unwilling
   to depart from the opinion commonly entertained, though chnph (chaneph)
   means an ungodly, deceitful, or treacherous and wicked man. He appears
   to point out the source of all the evils, that there was no true fear
   of God among them. By this he does not mean any slight dissimulation,
   but inward contempt seated in the heart, by which consciences are
   stupified, so that no instructions produce any effect on them; as if he
   had said that they were deeply sunk in their depravity. But as
   wickedness, when it has taken possession of the mind, drags the hands
   and feet, and the rest of the members of the body along with it, so the
   Prophet adds, that they are all evil-doers

   And every mouth speaketh villany. [154] Thirdly, he adds that they have
   proceeded to such a pitch of open wickedness, that they boast of their
   crimes without shame. The Hebrew word nvlh (niblah), which is
   translated folly, has frequently a more extensive meaning; for it
   denotes baseness, villany, and madness. (Genesis 34:7; Joshua 7:15;
   Judges 19:24.) Here, in my opinion, the Prophet means that they are so
   entirely abandoned to wicked courses, that we need not seek any other
   proof of it than from their tongues.

   His anger will not be turned away. He again repeats this statement,
   which ought to be frequently repeated; for it is not enough to have
   been once informed how dreadful are the judgments of the Lord against
   the wicked; so easily and quickly will there steal upon us that
   forgetfulness of them which banishes uneasiness, as well as fear, about
   the future. Besides, we are led astray and blinded by that deception,
   for we think that the infliction of a single punishment has exhausted
   the power of God. There can be nothing better, therefore, than to hold
   by this principle, that whenever God chastises us he threatens
   something more dreadful, if we do not quickly repent. (Leviticus 26:18,
   21, 24, 28.)

   But his hand is stretched out still. since the Prophet repeats this
   warning, let us unceasingly call to our remembrance, that the
   indignation of God is not yet appeased, though we may think that he has
   already punished us severely for our sins. What then ought we to
   conclude, when he has given us but a light chastisement? At the present
   day, for instance, we have endured some punishment; but what is it as
   compared with those dreadfully severe calamities which that nation had
   suffered, when Isaiah foretold that new chastisements were still
   awaiting them? What then will become of us? The Lord will undoubtedly
   continue to perform what belongs to him, and will always be like
   himself. If this dread do not arouse us, our insensibility is evidently
   beyond endurance. I have translated the verb sv (shab) in the future
   sense, will not be turned away, to make the meaning more clear; for
   though he speaks as if it had been a past transaction, still he
   threatens a continuance of punishments against the rebellious.

   18. For wickedness burneth as the fire. The Prophet attacks the wicked,
   who are accustomed to defend themselves by laying the blame on God.
   Either they practice evasions, in order to convince themselves that
   they are innocent, or, when they have been convicted, they still
   extenuate their guilt, as if the severity of God were beyond proper
   bounds. Never, certainly, do they acknowledge that God is just in
   punishing them, till they are compelled to acknowledge it; and even
   though they do not venture to excuse themselves publicly, still they
   fret and murmur. With the view of repressing such insolence, the
   Prophet compares the calamities to burning, but shows that the
   wickedness of men is the wood and fuel, by which the anger of God is
   kindled: as if he had said, "All exclaim and make loud complaints that
   the wrath of God burns violently, and yet they do not consider that
   their own sins are the fans by which it is inflamed, and that those
   sins supply the fuel, and that even themselves are consumed by the
   inward fire of their crimes."

   It shall devour the briers and thorns. The meaning is, that this flame
   will seize every part of Judea. Two things are here expressed, that the
   punishment of sin proceeds from the judgment of God, and yet that the
   blame lies with the sinners themselves, that they may not remonstrate
   with God as if he had dealt cruelly with them. There is a beautiful
   gradation; for we perceive that it usually happens that a fire, kindled
   in the lowest part of any place, gathers strength by degrees, spreads
   wider and wider, and ascends to the higher parts. Such will the wrath
   of God be; for Isaiah shows that it does not all at once seize the
   wicked, but is gradually kindled, till it utterly destroy them. At
   first the Lord proceeds gently, but if a light chastisement produce no
   good effect, he increases and doubles the punishment. If he see that we
   are obstinate, his wrath burns to the uttermost, so as to destroy us
   altogether, and consume us like a thick forest. Lastly, as the Prophets
   elsewhere declare, we must be like chaff and straw as soon as the wrath
   of God is kindled. (Psalm 83:14; Isaiah 5:24; 33:11; 40:24; 41:2;
   47:14)

   19. Through the anger of the Lord of hosts is the land darkened. After
   having shown that the cause of all our evils proceeds from ourselves,
   and that therefore the blame of it should be laid upon us, he at the
   same time shows that God is a most righteous avenger. When men draw
   down upon themselves calamities and distresses, God does not suffer
   them to escape his hand; not that he is inclined to cruelty, for he is
   gracious and merciful, (Exodus 34:6,) but because he is just, and
   cannot endure the wicked. The dreadful nature of God's vengeance is
   described by the metaphor of darkness, than which nothing can be more
   dismal; for without figures of speech a judgment so revolting cannot be
   expressed. And yet he appears to allude to smoke, of which he spoke in
   the former verse; for when a conflagration extends, and rages with such
   violence, the light must be overpowered by the thick smoke

   No man shall spare his brother. In this last clause and in the
   following verse, the Prophet describes the methods and means, as they
   are called, by which the Lord will execute his vengeance, when his
   wrath has been thus kindled. When no enemies shall be seen whom we have
   cause to dread, he will arm ourselves for our destruction. As if he had
   said, "The Lord will find no difficulty in executing the vengeance
   which he threatens; for though there be none to give us any annoyance
   from without, he will ruin us by intestine broils and civil wars." It
   is shocking and monstrous to relate, No man shall spare his brother,
   "every man shall devour his own flesh;" for no man ever hated his own
   flesh. (Ephesians 5:29.) But when the Lord hath blinded us, what
   remains but that we mutually destroy each other? And though it is
   monstrous, yet it happens almost every day.

   We are not restrained by any relationship either of blood, or of
   religion, or of the image of God, which we all bear; though even the
   heathen, on the contrary, were prevented, by sharing in this common
   nature, from injuring each other, because they perceived that the
   beasts themselves are restrained by similarity of nature from cruelty
   against their own kind; for a wolf does not devour a wolf, and a bear
   does not devour a bear. That human beings, from whom the name of
   humanity is derived, should fight with such cruelty and fierceness
   against one another as to exceed the rage of wild beasts, is monstrous;
   and this evil can arise from no other source than that God hath blinded
   them, and given them up to a reprobate sense. (Romans 1:28.) Justly
   hath Isaiah described this kind of revenge; for when men enjoy peace,
   they think that they are placed beyond the reach of danger, and dread
   nothing. But the Lord laughs at this indifference, and shows that he
   will execute his vengeance by their own hand, which he will arm and
   direct against them.

   20. Every one shall snatch on the right hand. It is equivalent to a
   phrase in common use, prendre et ravir a toutes mains, to take and
   seize at all hands. This mode of expression denotes either insatiable
   covetousness or insatiable cruelty; for the eagerness to snatch excites
   to savage cruelty. That they will be insatiable he expresses more
   emphatically, by saying that, in consequence of being impelled by blind
   fierceness and inconceivable rage, they will suck their brother's blood
   as freely as they would devour the flesh which was their own property.
   The bitterness of the vengeance is greatly heightened by this
   circumstance, that the children of Abraham, and the holy posterity of
   the chosen race, break out into such beastly fury. Let us therefore
   remember that it is a dreadful proof of heavenly punishment, when
   brothers are hurried on, with irreconcilable eagerness, to inflict
   mutual wounds.

   21. Manasseh, Ephraim. These tribes were closely related to each other;
   for besides their being descended from the same ancestor, Abraham, a
   close relationship arose out of their being descended from one
   patriarch, his grandson, Joseph. (Genesis 41:50-52.) But though they
   were closely allied, still God threatens that he will cause them to
   destroy themselves by mutual conflict, as if they were devouring the
   flesh of their own arm, and, consequently, that there will be no need
   of foreign enemies. He likewise adds that, after having wearied
   themselves out by mutual wounds, both will unite against Judah, in
   order to destroy it.

   And for all this his anger shall not be turned away. If any one take
   into consideration those calamities which Isaiah threatened, he will be
   amazed and greatly astonished that still more severe chastisements are
   foretold. But in this manner God acts towards the wicked, and does not
   cease to afflict till he utterly overwhelm and destroy them, when,
   after having been frequently invited, they refuse to be reconciled to
   him. We need not wonder, therefore, that he inflicts stroke after
   stroke, as he also foretold by Moses that he would punish seven times
   more (Leviticus 26:18), and bring seven times more plagues upon
   (Leviticus 26:21) those who would not repent; lest they should think
   that, when they had been punished once or twice, they would not be
   punished again.

   But his hand is stretched out still. By this he means that rods are
   prepared, that he may immediately strike with them; for it is not with
   a woman's passion that the Lord is angry, but his wrath is immediately
   followed by revenge.

   might have been found in Psalm 100:3, on which the reader may consult a
   valuable [15]note by the editor. (Com. on the Psalms, vol. 4.) In all
   the three cases (Exodus 21:8; Psalm 100:3; Isaiah 9:3) the Keri, or
   conjectural emendation, has strong internal evidence to recommend it
   above the Ketib, or reading that stands in the copies which have come
   down to us. Another method of solving the difficulty is exceedingly
   ingenious, and consists in turning the first part of the verse into the
   form of a question. Hast thou multiplied the nation, and hast thou not
   increased the joy? -- Ed

   [143] Pater tou mellontos aionos, Father of the future age. In the
   Messiah, Pope has beautifully introduced this passage -- "Mankind shall
   thus his guardian care engage,
   The promised Father of the future age."   That admirable poem appeared
   originally in the Spectator, No. 378, where the abundant foot-notes
   direct the reader to the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, as the source from
   which the poet has drawn his finest strokes and happiest illustrations.
   It is deeply to be regretted that the recent editors leave out those
   references, so valuable in the estimation of the author, that, in the
   edition prepared by his own hand, the finest lines in Virgil's Pollio
   are placed side by side with the quotations from Isaiah, "under the
   mutual disadvantage of a literal translation," for the express purpose
   of showing the immeasurable superiority of the Hebrew prophet. -- Ed.

   [144] This means that what is usually called Final Mem (m) is here
   used, instead of the form which the letter usually takes in the
   beginning or middle of a word. A Greek scholar would have been startled
   at seeing s instead of a s the beginning of a syllable. The peculiarity
   now in question must originally have been accidental, but took place at
   so early a period, and was so extensively copied, that no transcriber
   ventured to replace the ordinary form of the letter. At length it gave
   rise to the following Masoretic note: m stvmh v'mts tyvh, that is, Shut
   Mem in the middle of the word. The Jewish Rabbins have expended on it
   many conjectures and much useless learning. In their writings they
   excite no surprise, but it is impossible not to regret that they should
   have had even a momentary influence on the calm and sober judgment of
   Calvin, who so heartily despised idle sophistry and frivolous remarks.

   CHAPTER 10
     __________________________________________________________________

   Isaiah Chapter 10:1-34

   1. Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
   grievousness which they have prescribed;

   1. Vae decernentibus decreta iniqua, et qui dictantes dictant injuriam,

   2. To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right
   from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that
   they may rob the fatherless!

   2. Ut arceant pauperes a judicio, et eripiant jus pauperibus populi
   mei, viduas spolient, et pupillos praedentur.

   3. And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation
   which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where
   will ye leave your glory?

   3. Et quid facietis in die visitationis? Et cum desolatio venerit e
   longinquo, ad quem confugietis auxilii causa, et ubi deponetis (vel,
   munietis) gloriam vestram?

   4. Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall
   fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
   his hand is stretched out still.

   4. Nisi (vel, sine me) corruent inter vinctos, et inter occisos cadent.
   In hoc toto non erit aversus furor ejus, et adhuc manus ejus extenta.

   5. O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is
   mine indignation.

   5. O Assur virga furoris mei, et baculus ipse in manu eorum ira mea.

   6. I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the
   people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to
   take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.

   6. Ad gentem simulatricem mittam eum, et contra populum indignationis
   meae praecipiam ei, ut praedetur praedam; ut rapiat spolia, et ponat
   eum in conculcationem, quasi lutum platearum.

   7. Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it
   is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.

   7. Atqui ipse non sic arbitrabitur, nec cor ejus sic cogitabit; quia in
   corde ejus erit ad extirpandum et succidendum gentes non paucas.

   8. For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?

   8. Dicet enim, Annon Principes mei pariter Reges?

   9. Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria
   as Damascus?

   9. Annon, ut Carchemis, sic Calno? annon Hamath, sicut Arphad? annon
   Samaria ut Damascus?

   10. As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven
   images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

   10. Sicut invenit manus mea regnum idolorum, cum simulachra eorum sint
   prae Ierusalem et Samaria.

   11. Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to
   Jerusalem and her idols?

   11. Annon sicut feci Samariae et idolis ejus, ita faciam Ierusalem et
   idolis ejus?

   12. Wherefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord hath performed
   his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the
   fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his
   high looks.

   12. Sed accidet, Cum perfecerit Dominus totum opus suum in monte Sion
   et Ierusalem, visitabo super fructum magnificentiae cordis regis Assur,
   et super gloriam altitudinis oculorum ejus.

   13. For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my
   wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people,
   and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants
   like a valiant man

   13. Quia dixit: In fortitudine manus meae feci, et in sapientia mea;
   quia perspicax fui; et ideo abstuli terminos populorum, et recondita
   eorum diripui, et detraxi tanquam fortis sedentes.

   14. And my hand hath found, as a nest, the riches of the people: and as
   one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and
   there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.

   14. Et invenit quasi nidum manus mea opes populorum; et ut colliguntur
   ova derelicta, sic ego universam terram collegi; nec fuit qui abigeret
   ala, et aperiret os, et sibilaret.

   15. Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or
   shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod
   should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff
   should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.

   15. An gloriabitur securis adversus secantem ipsa? An magnificabitur
   serra adversus eum qui ipsum agitat? quasi elevatio virgae contra
   elevantem ipsam, quasi elevationes baculi, non ligni.

   16. Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat
   ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the
   burning of a fire.

   16. Propterea mittet Dominator Dominus exercituum in pingues ejus
   maciem, et subtus gloriam ejus succendet incendium, quasi incendium
   ignis.

   17. And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a
   flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one
   day;

   17. Et erit lux Israel in ignem, et Sanctus ejus in flammam;
   comburetque et devorabit vepres ejus et spinas die uno.

   18. And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful
   field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer
   fainteth.

   18. Gloriam sylvae ejus, et frugiferi campi ejus, ab anima usque ad
   carnem consumet; et erit quasi dissolutio signiferi.

   19. And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child
   may write them.

   19. Et reliquiae ligni sylvae ejus ad numerum erunt, ut puer eas
   numeret.

   20. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel,
   and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay
   upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy One of
   Israel, in truth.

   20. Erit in die illo. Non adjicient amplius reliquiae Israel, et
   superstites e domo Iacob inniti percussori suo; nam innitentur super
   Iehovam sanctum Israel, in veritate.

   21. The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
   mighty God.

   21. Reliquiae revertentur, reliquiae Iacob ad Deum fortem.

   22. For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
   remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow
   with righteousness.

   22. Nam si fuerit populus tuus Israel instar arenae maris, reliquiae
   ejus revertentur. Consumptio decreta inundans justitiam, (vel,
   justitia.)

   23. For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, even
   determined, in themidst of all the land.

   23. Quia consumptionem et finitionem Dominus Iehova exercituum facit in
   medio totius terrae.

   24. Therefore thus said the Lord God of hosts, O my people that
   dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee
   with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner
   of Egypt.

   24. Propterea sic dicit Iehova exercituum: Ne timeas, popule mi,
   incolae Sion, ab Assur. In virga percutiet te, et baculum suum levabit
   contra te in via AEgypti.

   25. For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and
   mine anger, in their destruction.

   25. Sed adhuc paululum, et consumabitur (vel, consumetur) furor et
   indignatio mea, in abolitione eorum.

   26. And the Lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him, according to
   the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon
   the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.

   26. Et excitabit Iehova exercituum contra eum flagellum, secundum
   caedem Madian in rupe Oreb; et virga ejus super mare, levabitque eam in
   via AEgypti.

   27. And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be
   taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and
   the yoke shall be destroyed because of the annointing.

   27. Et accidet in die illa, ut auferatur onus ejus ab humero tuo, et
   jugum ejus a cervice tua; et dissipabitur jugum a facie unctionis.

   28. He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath
   laid up his carriages:

   28. Venit in Aiath, transiit in Migron, in Michmas reponet vasa tua.

   29. They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at
   Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

   29. Transierunt vadum, in Gaeba pernoctaverunt hospitio; territa est
   Rama; Gibaea Saulis fugit.

   30. Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim; cause it to be heard unto
   Laish, O poor Anathoth.

   30. Hinni voce tua filia Gallim, fac audire Laisam paupercula Anathoth.

   31. Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to
   flee.

   31. Mota est Madmena; incolae Gebim collegerunt se.

   32. As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand
   against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.

   32. Adhuc dies: cum in Nob interquiescet, agitabit manum suam versus
   montem filiae Sion, collem Ierusalem.

   33. Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall lop the bough with
   terror; and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the
   haughty shall be humbled.

   33. Ecce, Dominus Iehova exercituum amputabit ramum cum terrore, (vel,
   potenter,) et procerae staturae excidentur, et sublimia humiliabunter.

   34. And he shall cut down the thickets of the forests with iron, and
   Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

   34. Et resecabit condensa sylvae ferro, et Libanus violenter cadet.


   1. Woe to them that decree. He now attacks the people more closely, as
   he did in the first and second chapters, to make them feel that they
   are justly afflicted; for men never acknowledge that they are justly
   punished till they have been manifestly convicted and constrained.
   Though they were sufficiently convicted by former proofs, still he
   found it necessary to come to particulars, that by means of them their
   hypocrisy might be exposed; for men are so brazen-faced as to think
   that any excuse shields them, and openly to accuse God. When they had
   become so shameless, it was impossible for him to rebuke them too
   sharply, or to carry his accusations beyond proper limits, so as to
   shut their mouths, whether they would or not.

   ml (gnamal) and 'vn (aven) are often joined together in Scripture, as
   in Psalm 7:14 'vn signifies vanity and iniquity, but the latter meaning
   agrees better with this passage. ml, (gnamal,) on the other hand,
   denotes vexation, and often the very cause of the vexation, that is,
   the oppression inflicted by the stronger on the weaker, when they abuse
   their authority and power. Having formerly shown that the wickedness
   originated from the governors themselves, (Isaiah 1:10,23,) he places
   them in the first rank, that they may undergo the punishment of the
   crimes which they had occasioned. This ought to be carefully observed,
   for they who are elevated to the highest rank imagine that they are
   exempted from the ordinary lot of other men, and that they are not
   bound to give account to God; and therefore he threatens that they will
   have this privilege, that they will be the first that are punished.

   Some think that two classes are here described, and draw a distinction
   between chqqym, (chokekim,) those who decree, and mktvym,
   (mechattebim,) those who write [155] But I do not approve of this, for
   he attacks generally, and without distinction, princes and magistrates,
   who oppressed the people by unjust and tyrannical decrees, in such a
   manner that they approached to absolute robbery; and therefore he
   includes every class of magistrates and governors.

   2. To keep back. [156] Others render it, to cause them to turn aside;
   but the true meaning is, to keep back the poor from judgment, or make
   them lose their cause. This is the iniquity and oppression which he had
   mentioned in the former verse, that the poor are deprived of their
   rights, and are robbed for the sake of the rich, and go away mocked
   from the judgment-seat, while everything is laid open to plunder. He
   chiefly mentions the poor, because for the most part they are destitute
   of help and assistance. While magistrates and judges ought to have
   assisted them more than others, they allow themselves greater liberty,
   and indulge more contemptuously in oppressing them. Those who have
   wealth, or friends, or favor, are less liable to be oppressed; for they
   have arms in their hands to defend, and even to revenge themselves. But
   the Lord says that he takes peculiar care of the poor, (Exodus 22:23;
   Deuteronomy 15:9, 24:15,) though they are commonly despised; and that
   he takes such care of them that he does not allow oppression inflicted
   on them to pass unpunished; for it is not without good ground that he
   calls himself the protector and defender of such persons. (Psalm 68:5.)
   From this consideration, therefore, the poor and weak ought to derive
   consolation, and more calmly to endure distresses and afflictions,
   because they learn that God takes care of them, and will not permit any
   injustice done to them to pass unpunished. The powerful and wealthy are
   at the same time warned not to take it as an incentive to sin that they
   have not been punished; for though no avenger be now seen, still the
   Lord will avenge, and will undertake the cause of those whom they
   imagined to be destitute of all assistance.

   3. And what will you do? Here the Prophet severely threatens princes,
   who were careless and indolent amidst their distresses, as men
   intoxicated by prosperity are wont to despise haughtily every danger.
   He therefore warns them that, though God delay, still he has fixed a
   time for judgment, and already it is close at hand. In consequence of
   having vanquished the neighboring nations in war, and fortified
   themselves by an alliance with a very powerful nation, they had no
   longer any fear; and therefore he expressly declares that their
   calamity will come from afar

   In the day of visitation. By visitation is here meant judgment, for God
   visits us in two ways, that is, in mercy and in judgment. In both ways
   he reveals himself and his power to us, both when, in compassion on us,
   he rescues us from dangers, and when he punishes those who are ungodly
   and who despise the word. Both kinds of visitation have the same object
   in view, for we do not see the Lord but in his works; and we think that
   he is absent unless he give us a token of his presence. This
   visitation, therefore, the Scripture accommodates to our capacity; for
   when we are pressed down by afflictions, and when the ungodly freely
   give themselves up to wickedness, we suppose that God is at a great
   distance, and takes no interest in our affairs.

   Accordingly, visitation must here be understood to mean the judgment by
   which God, in opposition to the waywardness and insolence of the
   ungodly, will bring them back like deserters. But if the judgments of
   God be so dreadful in this life, how dreadful will he be when he shall
   come at last to judge the world! All the instances of punishment that
   now produce fear or terror, are nothing more than preparations for that
   final vengeance with which he will thunder against the reprobate, and
   many things which he appears to pass by, he purposely reserves and
   delays till that last day. And if the ungodly are not able to bear
   these chastisements, how much less will they be capable of enduring his
   glorious and inconceivable majesty, when he shall ascend that awful
   tribunal, before which the angels themselves tremble!

   And when the desolation shall come from afar. When he says from afar,
   it is proper to observe that we must not allow the prosperity which we
   now enjoy to bereave us of our senses; for they who carelessly sleep
   amidst their vices, and by this wicked indifference call in question
   the power of God, will quickly feel that in a moment, whenever he
   pleases, he can shake heaven and earth from east to west.

   To whom will you flee? He declares that it is in vain for them to rely
   on their resources, for, in opposition to the hand of God, they will be
   fruitless and of no avail whatever. At the same time he likewise shows
   that this will be a most righteous reward; for when they are cruel
   towards others, they will justly be made to feel that they have now no
   help either from God or from men.

   They will have judgment without mercy who have showed no mercy. (James
   2:13.)

   This applies especially to the judges, who ought to have been a
   protection to the whole people; for they have been appointed for the
   purpose of defending the poor and wretched. But if they shall neglect
   and betray, and even plunder them, it is right that they should be made
   to feel, by their own destitute condition, how greatly this cruelty
   offends God.

   Where will you deposit your glory? This is understood by commentators
   to mean that they will be thrown down from their high rank. They
   suppose it to be an ironical and contemptuous question put by the
   Prophet, "What will become of that illustrious rank of which the nobles
   cruelly and foolishly vaunt, whenever God spares them for a little?"
   But as this was a forced rendering, I rather think that Isaiah asks,
   "Where will they find a safe hiding-place in which they may deposit
   their glory?" Thus I consider the meaning to be, to leave, [157] for
   the sake of being preserved; and the two clauses correspond to each
   other, To whom will you flee? and, "Where will you find a refuge for
   your glory in order to preserve it?" But perhaps a preference will be
   given to a different view, which I have noted in the margin; [158] for
   the verb zv (gnazab) signifies also to strengthen. Again, if God thus
   devotes to destruction princes who are thrown down from an elevated
   position, what will become of the lowest? No one, therefore, has any
   reason to flatter himself; for we shall all be like stubble when the
   wrath of the Lord has been kindled against us. (Psalm 83:13.)

   4. If they shall not fall down. As the meaning of the particle vlty
   (bilti) is ambiguous, various interpretations of it have been given by
   commentators. Some take it in an exclusive sense, as in many other
   passages of Scripture; as if he had said, Only he shall fall down among
   the bound and slain; that is, because all will be condemned and given
   up either to captivity or to death. Others render it, Without me they
   shall fall. If this rendering be preferred, the Prophet shows that the
   cause of their destruction is, that they have revolted from God; and
   unquestionably the cause of all our distresses is, to forsake the
   fountain of life and of salvation, and of all blessings. In this manner
   he sharply reproves the madness of the ungodly, who vaunt of having
   been forsaken by God, as if nothing were more desirable or pleasant
   than to withdraw to the greatest distance from him; and thus it will be
   an ironical reproof, that their calamity will arise from no other
   source than from the absence of God, in whom, without any good ground,
   they had rejoiced.

   Others consider it to be an elliptical expression, that they will have
   no hiding-place but by throwing themselves down under the captives and
   the slain. It might also be a form of an oath, If they shall not; [159]
   and the meaning would be highly appropriate, that God swears in wrath
   that he will spare none of them, but will abandon some to captivity,
   and will deliver up others to be put to death. In a word, this
   declaration shows what are the consequences that await all those who,
   after having been warned by the word of God, do not repent. From what
   immediately follows, we learn that a dreadful and alarming destruction
   is threatened; for he repeats what he had already said frequently, that
   the wrath of the Lord is not yet apparent, that he will find out more
   frightful punishments for avenging himself. This teaches us that
   nothing is more truly desirable than to be moved by a sincere feeling
   of repentance, and to acknowledge our fault, that we may obtain pardon
   from the Lord.

   5. O Assyrian. What now follows relates to the threatening of
   punishment, but at the same time mingles some consolation for
   alleviating the distresses of the godly. Indeed, the greater part of
   the discourse is occupied with this doctrine, that all the afflictions
   which shall be brought upon them by the Assyrians are a temporary
   scourge inflicted by God, but that unbelievers, after having too freely
   indulged themselves, will at length be brought to submission. hvy (hoi)
   is sometimes an interjection expressive of lamentation, Ah! Sometimes
   it denotes addressing, O! Sometimes it means, as the old translator
   rendered it, Wo to. But here it cannot be explained in any other way
   than that God calls the Assyrians, or assumes the character of one who
   sighs, because he is compelled to inflict punishment on his people by
   means of the Assyrians

   But when I more closely examine the whole matter, I rather come to this
   opinion, that here the Lord calls on the Assyrians, as if he armed them
   by his authority to carry on war. He had formerly said that they would
   come; but hypocrites are so careless that they are never moved by the
   fear of God, till his scourges are not only seen but felt. This is the
   reason why he now addresses them, Come; as if a judge called an officer
   and ordered him to put a malefactor in chains, or delivered him to the
   hangman to inflict capital punishment upon him. Thus the Lord calls the
   Assyrians to execute his vengeance by their hands.

   And the staff in their hand is mine indignation. This may be viewed as
   referring to the Assyrian, and may be explained so as to be a
   repetition of the same statement, with a slight change of the words.
   But I distinguish between them in this manner, that the Assyrians are
   called the rod of God's indignation; and next, that the swords and
   weapons with which they are furnished are nothing else than God's
   anger; as if the Prophet had said, that God, according to his pleasure,
   made use of the Assyrians in the same manner as swords for the
   execution of his anger; and further, that although they bear swords,
   still there will be no reason to be afraid of them, except so far as
   the wrath of God shall be displayed against the Jews.

   The general meaning is, "All the strength which the enemy shall possess
   proceeds from the wrath of God, and they are moved by his secret
   impulse to destroy the people, for otherwise he would not move a
   finger." God declares that the staff which is carried in their hand is
   his anger, in order to inform the Jews that the blind attacks of the
   enemies are regulated by a heavenly providence. The phrase vydm
   (beyadam) [160] is rendered by some, in place of them, or, into their
   country; but I do not approve of this, and it is too far-fetched. In a
   word, the Lord calls the Assyrians, as the ministers of his wrath, to
   punish the sins of his people by their hand, and declares that
   everything that is in their hand is his wrath

   This doctrine has two objects in view; first, to terrify the ungodly,
   and to inform them that not in vain does the Lord threaten their
   destruction; next, he points out the reason why he punishes them. This
   was of the greatest importance for shaking off the sluggishness of the
   ungodly, who laughed to scorn all the discourses and threatenings of
   the Prophet. Secondly, this doctrine was of great importance when the
   people themselves began to be afflicted by the Assyrians; for then they
   actually saw that what the Prophets had foretold was not without
   foundation, and that these things did not happen by chance.

   It will be objected, Why does he afterwards call the staff his anger,
   since he formerly said that the Assyrian is the rod of his indignation;
   for he ought rather to have spoken thus: "The Assyrian is my wrath, and
   the staff which he carries is the staff of my indignation." But we need
   not solicitously detain ourselves with the words, when we understand
   the Prophet's meaning. He calls men the staff of his anger, because he
   uses them like a staff. He calls men's weapons the wrath of God,
   because they are not regulated by their own choice, but are proofs of
   the wrath of God. The Prophet therefore spoke appropriately, that we
   might not think that the wicked rush forward, without control, wherever
   their lawless passions lead them; but, on the contrary, that a bridle
   restrains and keeps them back from doing anything without the will of
   God.

   Hence we ought to learn that the Lord acts even by the hand of the
   wicked. But here we must think and speak soberly; for it is proper to
   make a wise and judicious distinction between the work of God and the
   work of men. There are three ways in which God acts by men. First, all
   of us move and exist by him. (Acts 17:28.) Hence it follows that all
   actions proceed from his power. Secondly, in a peculiar manner he
   impells and directs the wicked according as he thinks fit; and although
   nothing is farther from their thoughts, still he makes use of their
   agency that they may kill and destroy one another, or that by their
   hand he may chastise his people. Of this method the Prophet speaks in
   this passage. Thirdly, when he guides by his Spirit of sanctification,
   which is peculiar to the elect. Whether, therefore, we are attacked by
   tyrants or robbers, or any other person, or foreign nations rise up
   against us, let us always plainly see the hand of God amidst the
   greatest agitation and confusion, and let us not suppose that anything
   happens by chance.

   6. To a hypocritical nation. He proceeds with the former statement, by
   which he called the Assyrian the rod of God's indignation; for as the
   father does not in vain take up the rod, but has this object in view,
   to chastise his son, so he declares that the Lord's rod has no
   uncertain destination, but is appointed for the chastisement of the
   unthankful and wicked. He calls it a hypocritical or wicked nation,
   because it has no uprightness or sincerity. Uprightness is contrasted
   with hypocritical conduct, because uprightness is the chief of all the
   virtues; and in like manner hypocrisy is the mother of all the vices.
   It is therefore no light accusation which he brings against the
   Israelites; but he charges them with what is most of all to be
   abhorred, and therefore immediately afterwards he calls them the people
   of his indignation, as he elsewhere calls the Edomites the people of
   his curse. (Isaiah 34:5.) Though he means that he is displeased with
   the Jews, yet the Hebrew phraseology is much more emphatic; for it
   conveys the idea that the reason why this nation is devoted to
   destruction is, that nothing is to be found in it but grounds of anger.
   Indeed, God is never angry with us unless we have provoked him by our
   sins; but when wickedness has come to its greatest height, his
   indignation is kindled, and cannot be appeased. Thus he cuts off the
   hope of reconciliation from hypocrites and wicked men, who ceased not
   continually to add sin to sin.

   I will command him to take the spoil and to take the prey. He says that
   he has given a loose rein to the fierceness of enemies, that they may
   indulge without control in every kind of violence and injustice. Now,
   this must not be understood as if the Assyrians had a command from God
   by which they could excuse themselves. There are two ways in which God
   commands; by his secret decree, of which men are not conscious; and by
   his law, in which he demands from us voluntary obedience. This must be
   carefully observed, that we may reply to fanatics, who argue in an
   irreligious manner about the decree of God, when they wish to excuse
   their own wickedness and that of others. It is of importance, I say, to
   make a judicious distinction between these two ways of commanding. When
   the Lord reveals his will in the law, I must not ascend to his secret
   decree, which he intended should not be known to me, but must yield
   implicit obedience.

   Now, if any one allege that he obeys God, when he complies with his
   sinful passions, he is guilty of falsehood, by vainly attempting to
   involve God in the guilt of his crimes, to which he knows that he is
   led by the failings of his own heart; for on this point no other
   witness or judge is needed but a man's own conscience. God does indeed
   make use of the agency of a wicked man, but the man has no such
   intention. It is therefore accidental, so far as relates to men, that
   he acts by the wicked and reprobate; for they neither know that they
   serve God, nor wish to do so. Accordingly if they seize on this
   pretext, it is easy to prove that, when they yield obedience to their
   own sinful passion, they are at the greatest possible distance from
   obeying God. They have the will of God declared in his law, so that it
   is in vain for them to seek it anywhere else. So far as they are
   concerned, they do not perform the work of God, but the work of the
   devil; for they serve their own lusts. (Ephesians 2:2.) Nothing
   certainly was farther from the intention of the Assyrians than to give
   their services to God, but they were hurried along by their lust and
   ambition and covetousness. Yet the Lord directed their exertions and
   plans to an object which was totally different, and which was unknown
   to themselves.

   This passage may be thus summed up. "It will be an uncommon and
   extraordinary instance of God's vengeance, when the Assyrians shall
   attack them with unrestrained liberty of action; for they will be sent
   by God, not to treat them with gentleness and moderation, but to
   plunder them in the manner of an invading army." He likewise adds, to
   tread them down. Nothing can go beyond this, for it means that the
   vanquished are not spared, but that every possible species of abuse has
   been heaped upon then.

   7. Yet he will not think so. [161] When wicked men vomit out their
   rage, they disturb weak minds, as if it were not in the power of God to
   restrain their pride and fury. The Prophet therefore steps forth
   beforehand to meet them, and exhorts believers, whatever may be the
   excess to which wicked men indulge their insolence, still to feel that
   they are justly chastised by a secret judgment of God. He shows, as we
   lately noticed, that nothing will be farther from the intention of the
   Assyrians than to give their services to God, and to be the ministers
   of his wrath; but we must also consider what is their own motive of
   action.

   Many would be ready to object, "Why dost thou, being God's herald,
   threaten us with the Assyrian; as if that savage beast would submit to
   execute the commandments of God?" He therefore replies, that God works
   with such amazing skill that he brings men to yield obedience to him,
   even without their knowledge or will. "Although," says he, "their
   attempts and plans are totally different, yet this will not prevent God
   from performing and carrying into execution, by means of them, whatever
   he has decreed."

   Many might likewise object, that it was a strange subversion of order,
   that God should place the elect people in subjection to the heathen
   nations; and that it was not just, however much the Jews had sinned,
   that their condition should be worse than that of those robbers who, on
   account of their wickedness and crimes, deserved the severest
   punishment. The Prophet therefore threatens that the Assyrians also
   will have their turn, and in due time will receive just punishment; and
   yet that it is not unreasonable that they should distress, plunder,
   devour, and slay other nations, because their own reward is reserved
   for them. Besides, the Prophet soothes the grief of the godly, and
   alleviates their solicitude and uneasiness, by declaring that God
   restrains the presumption of wicked men from carrying into effect
   whatever they think fit. He therefore shows that, however madly wicked
   men may rage, God mitigates his own judgments from heaven, so as to
   provide for the salvation of his Church. And thus, though the Assyrian,
   like a wild beast, may be eager to seize his prey, he bids them lift up
   their eyes to God, whose decree is far removed beyond the reach of that
   blind fury.

   8. For he will say. He explains the reason why the Assyrian will not
   think that he is the rod of God. It is because, being blinded by pride,
   he acknowledges no authority superior to his own; for it is impossible
   for those who rely on their own superiority, and claim ability to do
   this or that, to submit to the providence of God. The authority which
   we ought justly to ascribe to God is, to believe that we cannot move
   even the smallest finger without his permission. On the other hand,
   whoever imagines that he can do anything, however small, assumes to
   himself, with blasphemous pride, the power of God.

   Are not my princes altogether kings? The Prophet here gives a lively
   picture of the presumption of a heathen king in boasting that he had
   everything in his power. This is especially the case with eminent
   Princes who, abounding in wealth, resources, and power, are blinded in
   such a manner as hardly to know that they are men. The opportunities of
   learning this are too abundant; for what Prince is there at the present
   day, who knows or remembers that he is a man, and liable to the
   ordinary calamities of life? Their minds are so entirely intoxicated
   and deranged, that they believe that whatever they have undertaken they
   will at once accomplish, and will surmount every obstacle.

   9. Is not Calno as Carchemish? Here he mentions by name certain cities,
   though others think that they were countries; but it is more probable
   that they were cities, or some fortified places. "Shall it not happen,"
   says he, "to those places which I have not yet subdued as it has
   happened to others that opposed me?" He therefore compares Calno,
   Arpad, and Samaria, which he afterwards subdued, to Carchemish, Hamath,
   and Damascus, which he had formerly subdued, and says that those will
   not be stronger than these. Thus wicked men are wont to boast and talk
   proudly of their former actions, so as to imagine that they will break
   through every obstruction, and that nothing can stand in the way of
   their plans and exertions, and even think that they will accomplish
   everything without the will or knowledge of God.

   When we read this history, let us learn that we ought not to be proud
   of having been strong, or of having succeeded to our wish; for he who
   hath exalted us will be able to cast us down. And if he reproves the
   Assyrian for that haughtiness, how much more ought they to be reproved
   who ascribe to themselves the praise of righteousness and holiness, as
   if they could be regenerated by their own power; for it cannot be
   doubted that they rob God of his honor, and claim for themselves what
   belongs to him!

   10. As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols. The Assyrian now
   breaks out into far more outrageous language; for not only does he
   insult men, but he insults God himself, and even the very gods whom he
   worshipped. He boasts that the gods, whose protection the other nations
   enjoyed, could not prevent him from subduing them; and that the God of
   Israel, in whom Jerusalem and Samaria trusted, would not prevent him
   any more than they. Wicked men are so proud that they attribute to
   their own strength the victories which they achieve, and do not
   hesitate to exalt themselves against God and all that is worshipped.
   They allege, indeed, that they pay homage to the objects of their own
   worship, that is, to the idols which they have contrived for
   themselves, and bow before them, and offer sacrifices to them, by which
   they give some indication that they ascribe their victories to the
   gods; but afterwards, as Habakkuk says of Nebuchadnezzar,

   they burn incense to their own net, and sacrifice to their drag,
   (Habakkuk 1:16;)

   that is, by boasting of their exploits, wisdom, sagacity, and
   perseverance. Their hypocrisy is exposed, and their secret thoughts,
   which lay concealed under those folds of hypocrisy, are revealed, when
   they immediately claim for themselves what they appeared to ascribe to
   the objects of their worship. We need not wonder, therefore, that
   Sennacherib exalted himself against all that is worshipped, for that is
   the result of ungodliness.

   There are two ways in which his blasphemy is expressed. First, he
   exalts himself above God, and thinks that he will be stronger than God;
   and, secondly, he makes no distinction between God and the false gods.
   He sufficiently displayed his ungodliness, when he exalted himself
   alone even above idols; for although they are nothing but idols, yet as
   their worshippers ascribe to them some power and divinity, if they
   scoff at idols, they show that they despise every object of worship;
   for they treat idols with the same contempt as if they had had to do
   with God himself. Their own conscience testifies, therefore, that they
   carry on war against God, and they have no excuse arising from
   ignorance; for they think that God dwells in graven images. If that
   tyrant despised Apollo or Jupiter, he undoubtedly despised them, not as
   idols, but as having in them something divine. The second blasphemy of
   the tyrant was, that he placed the living God on the same level with
   the false gods of the heathen, and dared to scoff at him as well as at
   the others, and to ridicule the confidence of Israel, as if no greater
   power belonged to God than to idols.

   12. But it shall come to pass. Hitherto the Prophet had explained what
   would be the pride of the Assyrian, after having obtained a victory
   over Israel; but now he foretells what will happen to the Assyrian
   himself, and what will be the purpose of God against him. Wicked men do
   everything in the same manner as if God were not in heaven, and could
   not frustrate their designs. What else is the meaning of those haughty
   words, My hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, than this, that he
   thought that he would vanquish all the gods? But God opposes his
   designs, and, after having made use of his agency, punishes himself
   also.

   This verse contains two clauses. First, he declares that God will
   punish a wicked king. Secondly, he suggests that the time is not yet
   come, in order to encourage believers to the exercise of patience. He
   foretells that the time which God regards as fit for doing it will be,
   when he shall have chastised the sins of his Church; in the same manner
   as if the master of a house were to settle the disturbances of his own
   family. The object which he has in view is, that believers may not give
   way to despondency, when they behold a wicked tyrant in such a state of
   exultation, and may not abandon the hope of salvation, as if it were
   impossible to restrain him.

   I will visit upon the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria.
   [162] God promises, in a word, that after having permitted the Assyrian
   to plume himself beyond measure, he will in his turn be an avenger; for
   it belongs to him to repress the pride of the flesh, which is connected
   with sacrilege. Accordingly, the preposition l (gnal) [163] is
   emphatic, as if it declared that the Assyrian will not be protected by
   his loftiness from undergoing punishment. Fruit is here taken in a
   metaphorical sense, for wicked men think that they are happy and
   prosperous when they swell with pride, as if they gathered some fruit.
   He places in the foreground the heart, which is the seat of pride, and
   which, when it swells with haughtiness, pours out fierceness and
   cruelty. Afterwards, he adds the eyes, by which the inward feelings of
   the heart are manifested, and which, by being lifted up, are the
   heralds of secret vice. To whatever extent the Assyrian, in his pride,
   may elevate himself, God testifies that he has in his own power the
   means of suddenly changing his glory into dishonor and reproach.
   Accordingly, he includes contempt, scorn, disdain, and haughty looks,
   indicative of excessive confidence, which are usually beheld in proud
   men.

   I will visit. He introduces God as speaking, because that which God
   utters with his own mouth is more impressive, (emphatikoteron,) than if
   he spoke by the mouth of the Prophet. Hence draw a general doctrine.
   God cannot endure the arrogance of proud men, without suppressing it;
   for he wages incessant war with the haughty and disdainful. (Proverbs
   3:34; James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5.)

   When the Lord shall have finished his whole work. Observe how, in order
   to repress immoderate haste, the Prophet added this by way of
   limitation; for as soon as we see a proud man, we wonder that the Lord
   endures him. Isaiah here shows that God endures that proud tyrant,
   whatever may be the insolence with which he vaunts and exalts himself,
   because he chose to make use of his agency, and that the seasonable
   time for the Lord's destruction of the wicked is not always at hand,
   but that we ought to wait patiently for it. When he shall have
   chastised the kingdom of Judah, as if he were bringing the members of
   the family into a state of submission, he will not be slow or sluggish
   in punishing a foreign enemy; as a father commonly throws away or
   breaks the rod with which he chastised his son.

   His whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem. By a figure of speech in
   which a part is taken for the whole, (sunekdochikos,) Mount Zion is
   here put for the Church, and Jerusalem is employed in the same sense,
   in order that by means of the Temple and the royal city, as the head,
   he might describe the whole body, and by means of the most important
   part might describe the whole kingdom. He calls it the whole work,
   because through our foolish haste we would draw away God from his work,
   though it were only begun. More especially, our wrath against wicked
   men rages so strongly, that it is difficult to restrain our impatience,
   if God do not instantly comply with our wish in punishing them. To
   mitigate this fervor, he bids them allow full and ample time for God's
   fatherly chastisements.

   The whole work denotes a proper measure. This is a useful and highly
   consolatory doctrine; for we see wicked men, in a wonderfully arrogant
   and seemingly triumphant manner, mocking God, and uttering reproaches
   and slanders against his doctrine, so that hardly any words can express
   their insolence. If the Lord would comply with our wish, he would
   immediately hasten to subdue and destroy them. But he wishes first to
   humble his Church by means of them.

   On Mount Zion and on Jerusalem. He does not now speak of Syrians or
   Egyptians, but of the Jews, of Zion, of the Temple and the habitation
   which he was pleased to consecrate to himself. Thus, at the present
   day, there are various diseases of the Church, which the Lord
   determines to heal and remove. He has indeed begun to do so; but we are
   mistaken if we think that the work is finished; and he will not cease
   till he has subdued us, so that we may be moved by the true fear of
   him, and may submit to his yoke with becoming modesty and gentleness.
   We need not wonder, therefore, that he gives a loose rein to tyrants,
   and hitherto permits them to rage against the Church. But the
   consolation is at hand. When he shall have made use of their agency in
   chastising the Church, he will visit their pride and arrogance. And we
   need not wonder if God, by striking his elect first of all, expresses
   in this manner his peculiar regard for their salvation. Judgment must
   therefore begin at the house of God, and must afterwards extend to
   those who are without, who will endure chastisements still more severe.

   13. For he hath said, By the strength of my hand I have done it. The
   Prophet again repeats the highly blasphemous words which the Assyrian
   uttered; for he ascribes to his power and wisdom all the victories
   which he obtained. By strength of hand he means vast armies collected
   out of various nations. Yet at the same time he boasts of being a
   warlike king, as those blusterers are wont to claim the praise of
   everything that was done under their direction, though they were
   enjoying the luxury and ease of a retired life. Afterwards he boasts
   that he was cautious and wary, to use an ordinary phrase of our own,
   (J'ay este bien entendu et expert,) I was very skillful and clever. But
   there can be no doubt whatever that he bestows this honorable
   appellation on the tricks and dishonest cunning by which he had gained
   advantage over his neighbors. For what are the stratagems of kings and
   princes? To disturb the peace by indirect methods, to invent pretences
   for quarrels, to sow the seeds of discord, and, in a word, by their
   artifices to level all distinctions.

   I have removed the boundaries of the nations. This means, "I have
   extended the boundaries of my dominion, and have added other countries
   to my territories, so as to remove their boundary and limit." Just as
   if we were to say that the King of France removed the boundaries of
   Brittany, Burgundy, Aquitaine, Provence, and other countries, when he
   united them to his own kingdom. He likewise adds, "that nothing was so
   secret or concealed as not to become his prey;" as if he had said that
   by his sagacity he drew the neighboring countries into his nets, fished
   their treasures, and brought into his possession all that lay
   concealed.

   14. And my hand hath found as a nest. He adds, that it cost him no
   trouble to vanquish kings and amass their wealth; and he illustrates
   this by a comparison. As if one were to seek a nest and find one
   deserted by the birds, and consequently to take the eggs without
   difficulty; for if the parent birds were sitting on the eggs, having an
   instinctive desire to protect their nest, they would either fly at the
   robber, and attack him with their bill, or by loud and unpleasant
   noises endeavor to drive him away. But this tyrant boasts that there
   was no one who ventured so much as to open the mouth against him, and
   therefore that he had no difficulty in bringing all the kingdoms under
   his dominion. Accordingly, he lays claim to all these things, and
   attributes them to his wisdom, and makes no acknowledgment of the
   providence of God. These boastful pretensions the Prophet has purposely
   related as coming from the despot's own mouth, in order to show that
   they were so many bellows to kindle the judgment of God; for among men
   this haughtiness could not be endured, and how would not God restrain
   it?

   15. Shall the axe boast? He now ridicules more strongly the mad
   effrontery of the Assyrians in imagining that he could create mountains
   of gold; for he tells us that the case is the same as if an axe or a
   hammer should despise the hand which sets them in motion, and should be
   proud of their activity, though it is manifest that they have no power
   of their own to move. But before explaining the subject more fully, I
   shall touch briefly on the words.

   Like the rising up of a rod against him that raiseth it. [164] This
   second class of the verse is somewhat obscure. The matter is plain
   enough, but in the form of expression there is some ambiguity, in
   consequence of which commentators greatly differ. Yet, when I examine
   the matter closely, the rendering which I have given appears to flow
   more naturally than the others. "What is this? If a staff rise against
   the hand of him that raiseth it, and forget that it is wood, what a
   shocking exhibition will it be!" For it is not uncommon that the
   particle 't, (eth) which is the sign of the accusative, should mean
   against; and the copulative v (vau) is often superfluous. We shall thus
   have a meaning which is not ambiguous, and which agrees with the words
   of the Prophet. He formerly reproached the Assyrian for ascribing to
   his schemes and his army the victories which he had gained. He now
   says, that in this manner he boasts against God, just as if an axe,
   reckoning as nothing the hand of him that cuts, claimed the praise of a
   workman, or a staff, as if it were not dead wood and without any
   strength of its own, rose up against him that wielded it.

   Hence we learn that men rise up against God, whenever they ascribe to
   themselves more than is proper, and that in such cases they war not
   with men but with God himself. Away, then, with those proud and
   blasphemous expressions, "By my power and wisdom and perseverance I
   have done and contrived and accomplished these things;"

   for the Lord is a jealous God, (Exodus 20:5,)

   and does not permit his glory to be given to another!
   (Isaiah 42:8;48:11.)

   We must attend to those comparisons by which he likens men to
   instruments; and we must not view it as referring to the universal
   providence by which all creatures are governed, as some do, who
   acknowledge that all the creatures are moved by God, because they
   cannot deny it, but add, that each of them is driven according to its
   nature, as the sun, the moon, the heavens, and such like. Thus they
   imagine that man is driven hither and thither by his own choice and by
   free-will; because God does nothing more than continue that power which
   he once bestowed at the beginning. Their false explanation amounts to
   this, that the whole machinery of the world is upheld by the hand of
   God, but that his providence is not interposed to regulate particular
   movements. Thus they ascribe to God the rain and the fair weather
   because he is the Author of nature, but contend that, strictly
   speaking, God commands nothing, that the rain is produced by vapours,
   and that fair weather also is produced by its natural causes. But this
   confused direction, which they leave to God, is hardly the thousandth
   part of that government which he claims for himself. Justly therefore,
   does Isaiah show that God presides over individual acts, as they call
   them, so as to move men, like rods, in whatever way he pleases, to
   guide their plans, to direct their efforts; and, in a word, to regulate
   their determinations, in order to inform us that everything depends on
   his providence, and not on the caprice of wicked men.

   It is objected, that it would be absurd to call men axes and swords, so
   as to take away from them will and judgment, and everything that
   distinguishes them from inanimate creatures, and to make them, not men,
   but stocks and stones. But the answer is at hand. Though God compares
   men to stones, it does not follow that they resemble them in all
   respects. No one thing is exactly like another, but they agree in some
   points; for as a staff cannot move itself in any direction, and yet is
   fit for inflicting blows, so wicked men have something which belongs to
   them by nature, and yet they cannot be moved hither and thither,
   without being directed by the providence and secret decree of God. This
   fitness of things, if we may so call it, is no reason why the action
   should not be ascribed entirely to God alone.

   But the question about the will of man is unseasonably introduced on
   the present occasion. If God controls the purposes of men, and turns
   their thoughts and exertions to whatever purpose he pleases, men do not
   therefore cease to form plans and to engage in this or the other
   undertaking. We must not suppose that there is a violent compulsion, as
   if God dragged them against their will; but in a wonderful and
   inconceivable manner he regulates all the movements of men, so that
   they still have the exercise of their will.

   In this passage Isaiah chiefly shows that all the efforts of men are
   fruitless, if God do not grant them success; and therefore that the
   Assyrian, even if he had attempted everything, would not have
   succeeded, if the Lord had not bestowed the victories; and,
   consequently, that he had no reason for laying claim to the praise of
   those things in which his success was owing solely to God. This is
   confirmed by another metaphor, that the lifting up of a staff proceeds
   from the will of him who moves it, and not from the nature of the wood.
   [165]

   16. Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat
   ones leanness. He proceeds with the former doctrine, declaring that the
   Lord will show to the Assyrian how undeservedly he exalts himself, and
   will throw down his arrogance, in which he foolishly takes delight. As
   he trusted in his wealth and his forces, Isaiah declares that the Lord
   will take them away; and he does so under the metaphor of fatness and
   leanness. By the word fatness he means both riches and warlike power,
   in which he placed too much confidence; as if he had said, "Everything
   fat and rich that he possesses, the Lord will make the whole of it
   lean." It is not uncommon to compare prosperity to fatness; for as
   horses which are too fat become refractory, so as to throw the rider or
   kick when any one comes near them, so among men abundance produces
   fierceness of disposition, which is subdued by leanness

   And under his glory he shall kindle a burning. There is great beauty in
   the comparison, that a fire will be laid under his glory; for it means,
   that the greater the splendor of his prosperity, so much the more
   abundant will be the fuel for the conflagration. Yet it likewise shows
   that he will be utterly reduced to nothing; as if one were to cut down
   a tree from the roots, or overturn a house from the foundation. If
   nothing more than the branches of a tree be cut down, it quickly
   sprouts again; or if the roof of a house be consumed by fire, the other
   parts of it remain uninjured. He therefore leaves him nothing, but
   asserts that he will be brought down by utter destruction.

   As the burning of a fire. [166] The particle as, which points out the
   comparison, does not mean that the language is metaphorical, but rather
   that the burning will be such as to consume utterly the glory of the
   Assyrian.

   17. And the light of Israel shall be for a fire. There is an elegant
   allusion to that burning by which he threatened that he would consume
   the Assyrians. In fire there are two things, light and heat. As the
   Lord consumes the enemies by his heat, so he enlightens the godly by
   his light. It is very customary that God is sometimes called a
   devouring fire, (Deuteronomy 4:24, 9:3; Hebrews 12:29,) and sometimes,
   in a different point of view, he is called light, (Isaiah 60:20; Micah
   7:8,) because his power produces contrary effects on the godly and the
   ungodly. When he shines on the godly, he imparts life and nourishment
   to them, but he consumes and destroys the ungodly. In a word, while he
   threatens destruction to the Assyrians, he likewise brings comfort to
   the godly; and he does so in two ways, first, because they will see
   that God revenges the injuries which they have received, and, secondly,
   that they will be cheered by his light, and will thus receive a new
   life.

   And his Holy One for a flame. What that light is he states plainly, and
   without a metaphor, when he adds, his Holy One, so that it is
   unnecessary to make a more lengthened exposition. The meaning is, that
   he determines to protect that people which he hath chosen, and which he
   hath separated from the rest of the nations to be a peculiar people to
   himself.

   And it shall devour its thorns and briers in one day. He now shows that
   the favor of God, which shines in Israel, will be like a fire to
   consume enemies. In one day means, that he will burn them with a sudden
   and unexpected conflagration. It denotes an uncommon and dreadful
   burning, which usually overtakes the wicked suddenly, when they think
   that all is well with them, and that danger is at a great distance. He
   next shows that, whatever defences they may put forth, they will be
   like tow, which, as soon as it is set on fire, will instantly be
   consumed.

   18. And shall consume the glory of his forest. He goes on with the same
   comparison of a burning, and declares that the fire will consume both
   the highest and the lowest, and will leave nothing uninjured. It is
   possible that a fire might destroy the higher parts of a building, and
   might leave the lower parts unaffected.

   And of his fruitful field. I do not think that krml (Carmel) is here a
   proper name, but rather an appellative, denoting a rich and fertile
   soil; for to say that Carmel was held as belonging to the dominion of
   the king of Assyria, would have been inadmissible. The meaning
   therefore is, that not only will destruction overtake his forests, but
   the corn will be consumed by the same fire; for it will not only range
   over the heights, but will penetrate into the lowest places.

   From the soul even to the flesh. This comparison is taken from man. As
   man consists of a body and a soul, so each part of him is liable to
   separate diseases. It frequently happens that, when the soul is
   healthy, the body is diseased; and often the reverse takes place; but
   when both are unhealthy at the same time, the case is most dangerous.
   By this comparison, therefore, he threatens that the Assyrians will
   have nothing safe or sound, but that they will be devoted to utter
   destruction, because they will perish from the flesh even to the soul;
   not that souls are mortal, but because the vengeance of God will fall
   upon them also. This is truly dreadful; for the design of chastisements
   is,

   that the spirit may be saved, though the flesh be destroyed,
   (1 Corinthians 5:5;)

   but when the spirit also is involved in the destruction, what can be
   said or imagined that is more miserable? The flame only scorches the
   godly, but does not consume them as it consumes the ungodly, in whom it
   finds nothing but fuel fit for burning.

   And it shall be as the fainting of a standard-bearer. There is an
   allusion in the words of the Prophet, which cannot be conveyed in
   another language. The meaning is the same as in the other comparisons,
   that there will be utter destruction, like the complete rout of an army
   when the standard has been taken. When the ensigns have been taken, it
   is commonly followed by a great slaughter; and when historians describe
   a fearful carnage, they tell us that the ensigns were taken. He does
   not threaten these things against the Assyrians on their own account,
   that they may receive advantage from the warning or may be led to
   repentance, but to yield consolation to the godly, that they may not
   think that the Assyrians will pass unpunished when they raged so
   fiercely against the people of God, or entertain fears either that the
   Lord has forgotten his promise, or that he cannot frustrate their
   designs. If the Prophet had not put them on their guard, many scruples
   of this kind might have arisen in their minds.

   19. And the remnant of the trees of his forest shall be a number. [167]
   When he adds that the remnant of them will be a number, he employs a
   Hebrew idiom to express that they will be few; and thus he only
   confirms the former statement, that the devastation produced, after the
   calamity which God will bring on the Assyrians, will be so great that
   there will be no difficulty in counting them.

   That a child may number them. He goes so far as to say, that they will
   be so few that those who are left of them may be counted even by a
   child; for children have difficulty in counting as far as three or
   four. Accordingly, the kingdom of the Assyrians was formerly like some
   vast forest; but when the trees have been hewn and thrown down, those
   which are left are few, and scattered at great distances from each
   other.

   20 It shall be in that day. Returning now to the elect people, he
   describes the result of the chastisement which was at hand. As it is
   painful and disagreeable to us to endure calamities and afflictions,
   and as we refuse them so far as lies in our power, the Lord points out
   to us the result of them, that we may be taught to consider the design
   of them, and may thus bear more patiently: as if he had said, "You
   would wish that the Assyrians were driven to a great distance from you,
   and that you could live in comfort and safety. But consider, that this
   chastisement is as necessary as medicine would be for curing your
   diseases; for you do not acknowledge the power of God, and you withdraw
   your confidence from him to give it to wicked men. It is truly wretched
   to place the hope of salvation in enemies, and to rely on those who aim
   at nothing but your destruction." In like manner, Israel relied
   sometimes on the Assyrians and sometimes on the Egyptians.

   But shall stay upon the Lord We ought not to despise this compensation
   made for the diminished numbers of the people, that the small portion
   which survived the calamity learned to place their hope in God. Hence
   we see more clearly how necessary it was that God should chastise
   Israel. The mitigation which he holds out, that still a remnant is
   left, among whom the true worship of God is maintained, is fitted to
   yield very high consolation.

   In truth. This phrase is not superfluous; for until the Lord had
   afflicted them, all wished to be accounted the children of Abraham --
   all made profession of the faith, and indiscriminately worshipped God;
   but it was mere pretense. Isaiah therefore reproves this hypocrisy, and
   says that their hope will afterwards be true and sincere when they
   shall have been cleansed from impostures; for although they very
   haughtily boasted of their confidence in God, still they continued to
   place their confidence in the assistance of the Assyrians.
   Consequently, when they shall be chastised by their hand, they will
   learn to trust in God alone, and will withdraw their heart from the
   assistance of men. Hence infer that we cannot place our confidence in
   God unless we altogether withhold our heart from creatures; for we
   ought to rely on God alone in such a manner as not to think it a
   hardship to renounce all other grounds of confidence. Where this
   perfect confidence does not exist, there is no room for truth; for the
   heart is divided and double. (Psalm 12:2.)

   21. A remnant shall return. This is a confirmation of the former
   statement. Yet in the words s'r ysvv, (Shear Yashub,) a remnant shall
   return, there appears to be an allusion to that passage in which
   Isaiah's son was called Shear-jashub. (Isaiah 7:3.) In our observations
   on it, we stated that this peculiar name was given him in reference to
   the event, that it might be regarded as a pledge of the future
   deliverance concerning which his father prophesied. It was necessary
   that the Jews should be confirmed in various ways, that they might be
   convinced that the Lord would at length bring them back. This is also
   the design of what he immediately adds --

   To the mighty God; that is, to him whom the people, after having
   returned from their former apostasy, will acknowledge to be the
   guardian of their salvation. This attribute, mighty, is ascribed to God
   for the sake of the occasion on which the words were used. He might
   have thought it sufficient to have expressed power by the name 'l,
   (El,) God, which also signifies mighty; but he chose likewise to add to
   it gvvr, (gibbor,) that is, strong or mighty, in order to excite the
   people to greater confidence. How was it possible for the people to
   betake themselves to the Assyrians and Egyptians, but because they did
   not think that God was sufficient for them? This is the source of all
   evils, when we are not fully convinced that in God is everything that
   can be desired for our salvation.

   22. For though thy people be. He casts down hypocrites from foolish
   confidence; for they reckoned it enough to be the descendants of holy
   Abraham according to the flesh, and, therefore, on the sole ground of
   their birth, they wished to be accounted holy. Yet he exhorts the godly
   to patience, that they may learn to await calmly that calamity and
   diminution of their number, lest, when it took place, it should be
   unexpected, and give them uneasiness. He therefore comforts them, that
   they may not be grieved at so great desolation; for the Lord will at
   least collect a remnant of it.

   The consumption decreed. klh (chalah) means to finish, and it means
   also to consume. The latter is more appropriate. He calls this
   diminution of the people a consumption, and one that is completed; for
   he employs exaggerated language, the import of which is, that they were
   not far from utter extermination, there being very few that were saved.

   The word Israel may be taken either in the genitive case, of Israel, or
   in the vocative case, O Israel, [168] so that in this way he addresses
   the patriarch Jacob, or all the godly under his name. But it is of
   little importance, for the meaning is the same, in whichsoever of these
   ways it be taken; and therefore it may be read in the genitive case, of
   Israel. Yet I am more inclined to view it as a proper name, to denote
   the true, and not the spurious Israelite. The bold address to the
   patriarch has a striking effect; for God, addressing a dead man,
   declares to the living that what he had formerly promised, (Genesis
   13:16, 22:17,) that the posterity of Abraham would be like the sand of
   the sea, did not apply to a promiscuous multitude, which had
   apostatized from godliness, but that there would be a kind of
   interruption in a corrupt nation, till shortly afterwards it should be
   renewed.

   Overflowing with righteousness, or overflowing righteousness. [169]
   Another consolation is added, that this very small company will
   overflow righteousness. When we see the Church distressed by such heavy
   calamities, that we think that it cannot be far from destruction, we
   are in danger of giving way to despondency, and of entertaining doubts
   about the mercy of God. Those whose minds are impressed with just views
   of the judgment of God, feel that this is the severest of all
   temptations. It was therefore necessary that godly minds should be
   fortified against it, that they might soothe their grief by pondering
   the benefit which would result from this calamity. The benefit was,
   that righteousness would overflow the whole world like a river; and he
   had formerly noticed this, when he said (Isaiah 10:20) that the remnant
   would trust in God in truth

   The word righteousness is explained in various ways. Some refer it to
   the preaching of the gospel, because by means of it, as Paul says,

   the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, (Romans
   1:17;)

   and by the agency of the Apostles, who were a small remnant of the
   Jews, it spread over the whole world. (Mark 16:15.) Others choose
   rather to view it as meaning that that consumption was an evidence and
   proof of the righteousness of God in inflicting punishments so severe
   on his own people. But I prefer a more general exposition of it,
   namely, "This consumption will be sufficient to fill the whole world
   with righteousness. The remnant which shall survive it, though small,
   will be sufficient to cause such rivers of righteousness to flow, that
   the whole world shall be overflowed by them."

   23. For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption. This repetition
   again wounds the self-complacency of those who proudly despised God. It
   was almost incredible that the Jews, to whom so many promises had been
   given, and with whom God had made an everlasting covenant, should
   perish, as it were, in an instant; and it appeared to be even
   inconsistent with the unchangeable nature of God. The Prophet therefore
   declares that the Lord is the author of this consumption, in order to
   repress the pride of wicked men, who, relying on their present
   prosperity, thought that they were beyond all danger, and, swelling
   with that confidence, ridiculed all threats and warnings. "God," says
   he, "will reduce your land to a desert, so that in the very midst it
   will be desolate, and will resemble a wilderness."

   In the midst of all the land. By the midst of the land he means its
   very heart, that is, its most fortified and best defended places. Some
   think that the word nhrtsh (neheratzah) is an adjective, determined;
   but for my part I view it as a substantive, consummation; [170] and in
   this sense it is used by Daniel and in other passages. (Daniel 9:27.)

   Paul quotes this passage, (Romans 9:28,) but in somewhat different
   words from what the Prophet uses; for he follows the ordinary
   translation which at that time was generally used. Though Paul wrote
   correctly and faithfully, and in accordance with the Prophet's real
   meaning, yet the words which he quotes from the Greek translation have
   led many to depart from what the Prophet actually meant. The Greek
   translator having used the word logos, (logos,) that is, a discourse,
   many have entered into discussions about the Gospel, and have said that
   it denotes the repeal of the law, because it puts an end to ceremonies
   and figures, and therefore that it is a short and concise discourse, by
   which we are freed from the burden of the law under which the people
   groaned. But that has nothing to do with the Prophet's meaning; for
   here he says that the consumption is a diminution, by which the people
   will be almost ruined. Paul's design is not different, and the Greek
   translators meant nothing else; for by logos (logos) they meant what is
   expressed by the Hebrew word dvr, (dabar.) Though the Prophet does not
   make use of the word dvr, (dabar,) yet the word which he uses means a
   thing consumed, that is, consumption, and the meaning of both words is
   the same. In short, Paul there repeats (Romans 9:28) what Isaiah had
   said in this passage about the future consumption of the people, and
   shows that this prediction was chiefly fulfilled in his own time, when
   the Jews were cut off from the kingdom of God on account of their
   ingratitude, and but a small remnant (Isaiah 1:9, 10:22) was preserved.

   24. Therefore, thus saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts. He goes on with
   the same consolation, which belongs to the godly alone, who at that
   time, undoubtedly, were few in number. A great number of persons
   gloried in the name of God, and wished to be accounted his people; but
   there were few who actually performed what they professed in words;
   and, therefore, he does not address all without reserve, but only those
   who needed consolation. The kingdom having been destroyed, they might
   entertain fears about themselves and their affairs, and might judge of
   their own condition from that of others, and therefore it was necessary
   to comfort them. This distinction ought to be observed, for otherwise
   it would be inconsistent to address to the same persons statements so
   different.

   And shall lift up his staff against thee in the way of Egypt [171] He
   adds a ground of consolation, namely, that that calamity will be
   nothing else than the lifting up of a rod to chastise, but not to
   destroy them. The preposition v (beth) denotes resemblance. drk
   (derech) means a pattern, and therefore I render it, after the pattern
   of Egypt. As if he had said, "Though the Assyrian be cruel, and in many
   ways aim at thy destruction, yet he shall only wound, he shall not slay
   thee." He therefore mentioned the pattern of the Egyptian bondage,
   which was indeed very wretched, but yet was not deadly. (Exodus 1:14,
   12:51.) It is customary with the Prophets, amidst perplexity or
   disorder, to remind the people to contemplate that deliverance by which
   God miraculously rescued them from the hands of Pharaoh, who was a most
   cruel tyrant. The meaning therefore is, "As the Lord was at that time
   victorious, and destroyed the Egyptians who had leagued for your
   destruction, so now he will quickly vanquish the Assyrians."

   Others render it, in the way of Egypt, because the Assyrians made war
   against the Jews on account of the Egyptians. But that exposition
   cannot be admitted; and if we carefully examine the matter, it will be
   found that there is none more appropriate than that which I have
   proposed, and which is also approved by the most learned commentators.
   There are two clauses which form a contrast; the oppression which the
   Egyptians laid upon them, and the calamity which should be inflicted
   soon afterwards by the Assyrians. "As the oppression of the Egyptians
   was not deadly, so neither will the oppression of the Assyrians be. You
   have had experience of my strength and power against Pharaoh, and so
   will you find it on Sennacherib." If we did not explain the clauses in
   this way, they would not agree with each other.

   25. But yet a little while. He means not only the siege of Jerusalem,
   when Sennacherib surrounded it with a numerous army, (2 Kings 18:17,)
   but likewise the rest of the calamities, when Jerusalem was overthrown,
   (2 Kings 25:4,) the Temple razed, and the inhabitants taken prisoners;
   for against those dreadful calamities it was necessary that the godly
   should be fortified by these promises. This ought to be carefully
   observed; for if we neglect it, as other commentators do, we shall not
   be able to see how the statements agree. Accordingly, the captivity of
   the people might be called a consumption; for Babylon was like a grave,
   and banishment was like death. But when the danger was immediate and
   urgent, and Sennacherib attacked them with his army, and various
   straits were felt by them in that siege, this consolation was needful;
   for Judea seemed to be utterly ruined, and to outward appearance no
   hope of safety was left.

   My fury and indignation shall be spent. [172] The consolation
   corresponds to this state of things. "The Lord will spare thee. For a
   time, indeed, he will delay, and will keep his assistance as it were
   concealed; but he will at length rescue thee, and will revenge thy
   enemies whom he has determined utterly to destroy." If it be thought
   better to interpret klh (chalah) as meaning to consume or spend, then
   he says that he spends his anger, in the same way that we speak of
   spending years and our whole life; that is, "I will cherish my anger
   until I completely destroy the Assyrians." But the word finish brings
   out the meaning more fully; as if he had said, "until I have discharged
   all my anger." This is the destruction which he also threatens
   elsewhere (Isaiah 52:1) to the uncircumcised; for when the hope of
   mercy has been taken away, he executes his judgment against the
   ungodly.

   26. And the LORD of hosts will stir up a scourge for him. Here Isaiah
   makes use of the word scourge, and not rod, meaning that the Lord will
   treat the enemies much more harshly and severely than they had treated
   the Jews. He threatens them with extermination, and makes it more
   evident by two examples; first, that of the Midianites, (Judges 7:25,)
   who were cut off by a dreadful slaughter in the valley of Oreb, which
   was so named from their leader, and, secondly, that of the Egyptians,
   whom the Lord, when they pursued after his people, sank in the Red Sea.
   (Exodus 14:27, 28.) In the former passage, he refers to a narrative
   which was somewhat more recent, and in the latter to one that was more
   ancient.

   Hence we infer that the Lord hath displayed his power in defending his
   Church, in order that, when our affairs are in the most desperate
   state, we may remain steadfastly in the faith, and, relying on his
   grace, we still may cherish a pleasing hope. By means and in ways that
   are unexpected he often delivers his Church, as he did by the hands of
   Gideon and Moses. We ought always, therefore, to call to remembrance
   those benefits, that we may be excited more and more to confidence and
   perseverance.

   Hence we ought also to infer that all the afflictions which we endure
   are the Lord's rods with which he chastises us; and yet he does not
   permit Satan or his agents to inflict deadly chastisements upon us. On
   the other hand, an awful destruction awaits our enemies, as we see in
   the Midianites and Egyptians. It is therefore no small consolation
   that, when we compare our condition with theirs, we see them, for a
   time indeed, in all the madness of joy and of wickedness insulting the
   children of God, but at the same time learn what a dreadful sentence
   has been pronounced against them; for they are devoted to deadly and
   everlasting destruction.

   27. And it shall come to pass in that day. It is uncertain whether he
   now speaks of the deliverance which took place under Zerubbabel, (2
   Chronicles 36:22, 23; Ezra 1:2,) or of that wonderful overthrow of
   Sennacherib, (2 Kings 19:35,) when he besieged Jerusalem with a huge
   army. This latter opinion is almost universally preferred; and indeed
   it appears to be supported by what follows, for immediately afterwards
   he gives a description of the country, and enumerates the chief places
   through which Sennacherib should conduct his army, till he arrived at
   Jerusalem itself, so that there appeared to be nothing at all to hinder
   him from taking possession of the city. With this opinion I partly
   agree, but I extend the prediction farther.

   Isaiah intends to comfort the godly who were involved in the present
   distress. It might be thought that the promise failed, and that the
   calamities which immediately followed were utterly at variance with it.
   For instance, if the Lord promise to give me food for next year, and
   yet leave me altogether destitute of it, what faith can I have in a
   promise so distant, if the Lord do not rescue me from the present
   distress? Thus, the Lord's promise, in which he had said that he would
   deliver his people from Babylon, and would continually assist them, may
   be thought to have failed, when it was exposed to the jaws of that huge
   wild beast. With the view of meeting this objection, the Prophet
   includes both promises, that the Lord will be the guardian of his
   people, till at length he deliver them from death. Some limit it to the
   slaughter (2 Kings 19:35) of Sennacherib's army; but as Isaiah promises
   the loosing, or breaking of the yoke, I have no doubt that he describes
   deliverance from captivity. Yet he confirms the promise, that God will
   not only rescue them from Babylon, but will also aid them against the
   besieging army of the tyrant, whom he will not suffer to go beyond what
   has been threatened.

   That his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke
   from off thy neck, He describes that tyranny in two ways, in order to
   illustrate more fully how great was the blessing of deliverance. If it
   be thought best to refer it to Sennacherib, he had not laid on the Jews
   so grievous a yoke. The people paid only some tribute, as we learn from
   sacred history. (2 Kings 23:33; 2 Chronicles 36:3.) Why then has he
   employed two names in describing this tyranny? It may be pleaded that
   he had in his eye the approaching danger; for that tyrant, like a huge
   beast of prey, had devoured the whole of Judea by his voraciousness,
   and had oppressed them to such an extent, that it appeared to be almost
   impossible that his yoke could ever be taken off. But I have already
   explained the view which I prefer, that he describes the uninterrupted
   course of the favor of God down to the time of redemption.

   And the yoke shall be destroyed from the face of the anointing. [173]
   The phrase, the face of the anointing, is explained by some to mean the
   fatness with which the yoke is besmeared. But that interpretation is
   too farfetched. Others more correctly view smn (shamen) as bearing its
   ordinary signification, and as denoting anointing or oil. He again
   reminds them of Christ, and shows that through his kindness they will
   be delivered from that tyranny. Anointing is the name given to that
   kingdom which the Lord had set apart for himself, and which he
   therefore wished to keep unspotted and undiminished. When the Prophets
   intend to applaud the majesty of that kingdom, they speak of the
   anointing which the Lord had bestowed on it as a distinguishing mark,
   because it was a type of Christ. (Psalm 45:7, 89:20; Isaiah 61:1;
   Daniel 9:24.) Though God established the rest of the kingdoms, still
   they were in some respects profane; this ranked above them as holy and
   sacred, because the Lord reigned over Judea in a peculiar manner, and
   because under this figure of a kingdom he held up Christ to their view.
   For this reason, also, it was promised to Solomon that his throne would
   be everlasting. (2 Samuel 7:13; 1 Chronicles 22:10; Psalm 89:5.) As to
   the interpretation given by some, that smn (shamen) denotes the king
   himself, not only is it too farfetched, but it conveys no solid
   instruction.

   The Prophet therefore points out the means of overthrowing that
   tyranny; for it appeared as if there were no reason to believe that the
   yoke of so powerful a tyrant would be broken. He shows that this will
   arise from the heavenly anointing of that kingdom, that all may
   perceive that this benefit depends on the power of Christ, and not on
   the ability of man or on chance.

   28. He is come to Aiath. The siege of the holy city being now at hand,
   Isaiah sets before their eyes the whole of Sennacherib's march, that
   the hearts of the godly, by long and careful study of it, may remain
   steadfast. This delineation was powerfully calculated to allay their
   fears, when godly men saw that the Assyrians did not move a step but by
   the appointment of God; for by the mouth of the Prophet he had given a
   lively description of the whole of that march. [174] It is unnecessary
   to spend much time in explaining the relative position of the places
   here named, for it is enough if we understand that Sennacherib marched
   through those places of which the Jews had been informed.

   At Michmash he will lay up his baggage. The words which we render, He
   will lay up his baggage or armor, are translated by some, He hath made
   a muster; for phqd (pakad) signifies also to number. I do not dislike
   this interpretation, but prefer the former; for I understand the
   Prophet to mean that the Assyrian will lay up his armor, that is, the
   provisions, and the rest of the implements of war, in Michmash. It is
   the custom of warriors not to lead forward an army without providing
   the means of support, which they lay up in a safe and convenient place,
   that the army may be supplied out of it with all that is needful. Under
   the word baggage or arms, he includes not only darts and swords, but
   all the supplies and provisions of war. The meaning of the word kly
   (cheli) is extensive, and includes every kind of implements, and thus
   resembles the word (vasa) which denotes vessels in the Latin language.

   29. They have crossed the ford. [175] Some understand by this the
   passage of the Jordan, but I do not know if it could be crossed by a
   ford in that quarter. [176] He describes how great will be the terror
   when they hear of the approach of the Assyrian, that the whole country
   will be struck with terror and alarm, so that the Assyrian will subdue
   it without any difficulty. When such dread has seized their hearts,
   they will freely surrender at the first attack of the enemy, so that
   the conquerors will be allowed to ravage at their pleasure. He passes
   from the singular to the plural number, because he speaks sometimes of
   the king and sometimes of the whole army.

   Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled. He mentions Ramah in
   preference to the rest, because it was the nearest town; and he
   describes the flight of the inhabitants of some towns, as if the mere
   report had terrified them to such a degree that they gave up their
   country into the enemy's hand. After having spoken of so great dismay,
   he adds. --

   30. Neigh, [177] O daughter of Gallim. By the word neigh he denotes the
   howling and cries which will be heard at a distance. It is very common,
   in the Hebrew language, to call cities daughters. He says that the
   howling will be so great that it will be heard even by the neighboring
   cities; for at Laish will be heard the groanings which will be uttered
   in Anathoth

   31. Madmenah is removed. In exaggerated language he describes that city
   to have been shaken to such a degree, as if it had been removed to
   another place. This relates to the disorderly movements of a people in
   flight; as if he had said that the inhabitants of that city were thrown
   into as great a commotion as if the city had been razed to its
   foundations.

   The inhabitants of Gebim have gathered themselves. This may be
   explained to mean that they are so terrified that they crowd together
   in a body. Others understand by it, that they rush out in a disorderly
   manner, as if there were not room for a free passage.

   32. Yet a day. [178] Some interpret this, that the Assyrian will yet
   remain one day in Nob, which was a village contiguous to Jerusalem, as
   Jerome and others declare. But I rather agree with those who think that
   it means, that he will have a great part of the day before him when he
   halts there, in order to make preparations for besieging Jerusalem on
   the following day. He intends to describe the rapid march of the
   Assyrian, and how near Jerusalem was to utter destruction; as if he had
   said, that he had but a small part of the journey to perform, and that
   before the day was ended, he would arrive at that city.

   He shall shake the hand. This contributes still more to show their
   terror; for Sennacherib, having conquered the whole country, will
   threaten Jerusalem, as if he could storm it by the slightest expression
   of his will.

   Against the mountain of the daughter of Zion. By a figure of speech, in
   which a part is taken for the whole, (sunekdochikos,) he includes the
   whole city under the name of the mountain, because that part was
   higher, and commanded a view of the other quarters of the city. From
   this confidence of the tyrant, he shows that Jerusalem was not far from
   utter destruction; for the whole country, and even the city, was struck
   with such terror that none ventured to oppose him. By these details,
   therefore, the Prophet intended to give a more impressive view of the
   kindness of God, that it ought to be ascribed to the extraordinary
   favor and goodness of God, and not to human aid, of which there was
   none, that Jerusalem was preserved, as if a sheep had been rescued from
   the jaws of a lion.

   Behold, the Lord Jehovah of hosts. Almost all explain this passage as
   referring to the Assyrians. (2 Kings 19:35.) They think that the
   Prophet threatens against them that slaughter with which the Lord
   destroyed them, after that they had besieged Jerusalem. As if he had
   spoken in this manner: The Assyrian will indeed be elated with such
   pride, that as soon as he has seen Jerusalem, he will think that it is
   in his power. All being struck with such dismay at his approach, that
   some shall flee and others shall freely surrender themselves, he will
   imagine that all are subdued under him; but the Lord will quickly
   reverse his condition, and lop off those lofty branches

   But for my own part, when I examine closely the whole passage, and
   especially what he adds soon afterwards about Lebanon, and the
   consolation which immediately follows, I think that this passage ought
   to be referred to the Jews themselves. Isaiah therefore proceeds, in my
   opinion, to threaten the calamities which awaited the people. As if he
   had said, "Not only will he come to Nob, but he will spread devastation
   far and wide over the whole country. Everything in it that is excellent
   and lofty, he will completely waste and destroy, in the same manner as
   if one should cut off branches from a tree or cut down a tree from the
   root."

   This interpretation is confirmed by the following chapter, in which the
   Prophet offers consolation against that calamity; for the consolation
   agrees with this verse, and is added as an appropriate remedy for
   soothing grief. Nor do I attach any importance to the division of the
   chapter, which is often very absurd, and which perplexes the whole of
   the Prophet's meaning. I think, therefore, that we ought to connect
   that consolation with these verses, as if there had been no such
   division.

   34. And he will cut down the thick places of the forest with iron.
   There is no difficulty in explaining this metaphor, for it is plain
   enough that by tall and high trees is denoted all that is powerful,
   excellent, or lofty. Thus he foretells the destruction and ruin of
   Judea, which he compares to the cutting down of a forest; by which he
   means that there is nothing so valuable that the enemies will not
   destroy it, till they have stripped the whole land of its ornaments.

   And Lebanon will fall violently. He mentions Lebanon, because that
   mountain, as we all know, was highly celebrated for fruitful and highly
   valuable trees. Now, if he had been speaking of the Assyrians, it would
   not have been appropriate to introduce the destruction of Lebanon.
   Hence we infer that the Prophet, in this passage, again threatens the
   Jews; and this agrees well with the introduction of the discourse, for
   it begins with a word which calls attention, Behold.

   Isaiah Chapter 11:1-16

   1. And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a
   Branch shall grow out of his roots:

   1. Sed prodibit virga ex trunco Isai; et surculus de radicibus ejus
   fructus edet.

   2. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom
   and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
   knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;

   2. Et requiescet super eum Spiritus Iehovae, spiritus sapientiae et
   intelligentiae, spiritus consilii et fortitudinis, spiritus scientiae
   et timoris Iehovae.

   3. And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord;
   and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove
   after the hearing of his ears:

   3. Et sagacem illum reddet in timore Iehovae; non secundum aspectum
   oculorum suorum judicabit, neque ex auditu aurium suarum arguet.

   4. But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with
   equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the
   rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the
   wicked.

   4. Nam judicabit in justitia pauperes, et in aequitate arguet mansuetis
   terrae; et percutiet terram virga oris sui, et spiritu labiorum suorum
   interficiet impium.

   5. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness
   the girdle of his reins.

   5. Et erit justitia balteus lumborum ejus, et fides balteus renum ejus.

   6. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie
   down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling
   together; and a little child shall lead them.

   6. Habitabit lupus cum agno, et pardus cum hoedo accubabit; vitulus, et
   leo, et pecus pingue pariter; et puer parvus reget eos.

   7. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down
   together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

   7. Vacca et ursus pascentur; simul accubabunt foetus eorum. Et leo,
   quasi bos, comedet paleas.

   8. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the
   weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

   8. Et oblectabitur infans super foramine aspidis; et super speluncam
   cerastis qui ablactatus est manum suam mittet.

   9. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the
   earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover
   the sea.

   9. Non nocebunt, neque injuriam inferent in toto monte sanctitatis
   meae; quoniam impleta erit terra scientia Iehovae, tanquam aquis mare
   operientibus.

   10. And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand
   for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his
   rest shall be glorious.

   10. Et erit in die illa, Radix Isai, quae stabit in signum populorum,
   requiretur a Gentibus, et erit requies ejus gloria.

   11. And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his
   hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which
   shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from
   Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the
   islands of the sea.

   11. Et erit in die illa, adjiciet Dominus rursus manum suum ad
   possidendas reliquias populi sui, quae residuae erunt ab Assur, et ab
   AEgypto, a Parthia, ab Arabia, ab AEthiopia, a Perside, a Chaldaea, ab
   Hamath, et ab insulis maris.

   12. And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble
   the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from
   the four corners of the earth.

   12. Et levabit signum Gentibus, congregabitque ejectos Israel, et
   dispersiones Iuda congregabit a quatuor plagis terrae.

   13. The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah
   shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex
   Ephraim.

   13. Et abscedet aemulatio Ephraim, et hostes Iuda excidentur. Ephraim
   non aemulabitur Iuda, nec Iuda anget Ephraim.

   14. But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the
   west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their
   hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them.

   14. Involabunt autem in humeros Philistinorum ad occidentem; diripient
   pariter filios orientis, AEdom et Moab missio manus eorum, et filii
   Ammon obedientia eorum.

   15. And the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea;
   and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and
   shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry-shod.

   15. Et in nihilum rediget Iehova linguam maris AEgypti; et eriget manum
   suam super fluvium in fortitudine venti sui; et percutiet illum in
   septem rivis, et faciet calcari cum calceamentis.

   16. And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which
   shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that
   he came up out of the land of Egypt.

   16. Et erit semita reliquiis populi ejus, quae residuae erunt ab Assur,
   quemadmodum fuit Israel, in die qua ascendit e terra AEgypti.


   1. But there shall come forth a rod. As the description of such
   dreadful calamities might terrify the godly, and give them reason for
   despair, it was necessary to hold out consolation; for when the kingdom
   was destroyed, cities thrown down, and desolation spread over the whole
   country, there might have been nothing left but grief and lamentation;
   and therefore they might have tottered and fallen, or been greatly
   discouraged, if the Lord had not provided for them this consolation. He
   therefore declares what the Lord will afterwards do, and in what manner
   he will restore that kingdom.

   He pursues the metaphor which he employed towards the conclusion of the
   former chapter; for he had said that Jerusalem would be destroyed, as
   if a forest were consumed by a single conflagration. (Isaiah 10:33,34.)
   Its future desolation would be like that of a country formerly covered
   with forests, when the trees had been cut down, and nothing could be
   seen but ashes. That those things which are contrasted may answer to
   each other, he says, that out of the stock will come forth a branch,
   which will grow into a tree, and spread its branches and fruits far and
   wide. I have therefore preferred translating gz (gezang) a dry stock,
   rather than a root, though it makes little difference as to the
   meaning, but the former expresses more fully what the Prophet meant,
   namely, that though the stock be dry, the branch which shall spring
   from it shall be more excellent than all the forests.

   Hence we infer that this prediction applies solely to the person of
   Christ; for till he came no such branch arose. It certainly cannot be
   applied to Hezekiah or Josiah, who, from their very infancy, were
   brought up in the expectation of occupying a throne. Zerubbabel (Ezra
   3:8) did not attain the thousandth part of that elevated rank which the
   Prophet extols. We see, therefore, that to the wretched and almost
   ruined Jews, consolation was held out in the Messiah alone, and that
   their hope was held in suspense till he appeared. At the time of his
   appearance, there would have been no hope that the kingdom would be
   erected and restored, if this promise had not been added; for the
   family of David appeared to be completely extinct. On this account he
   does not call him David, but Jesse; because the rank of that family had
   sunk so low, that it appeared to be not a royal family, but that of a
   mean peasant, such as the family of Jesse was, when David was
   unexpectedly called to the government of the kingdom. (1 Samuel 16:1; 2
   Samuel 7:8.) So then, having sustained this calamity and lost its
   ancient renown, it is denominated by the Prophet the family of Jesse,
   because that family had no superiority above any other. Accordingly, I
   think that here, and not towards the conclusion of the former chapter,
   the consolation begins.

   Amidst such frightful desolation they might doubt who should be their
   deliverer. He therefore promises that one will spring even out of a dry
   trunk; and he continues, as I mentioned a little before, the same
   metaphor of a forest, because it is far more beautiful than if he had
   said in plain language that the Messiah would come. Having threatened
   that the forest would be entirely cut down, he adds, that still a
   branch will arise out of it, to restore the abundance and magnificence
   of the consumed forest; that is, Christ, who should be the deliverer of
   the people. How low his beginning was, it is unnecessary to explain.
   Undoubtedly, he was so far from having anything splendid or attractive,
   that with the exception of his birth, everything, to the view of the
   flesh, was inconsistent with the character of the Redeemer. Even his
   birth was almost obscured; for who would have thought that a poor
   carpenter (Mark 6:3) was descended from a royal family? Again, where
   was Christ born, and how had he been brought up? In short, his whole
   life having been mean and even contemptible, he suffered a most
   disgraceful death, with which he had to begin his kingdom. Yet he grew
   to an immeasurable height, like a large tree from a small and feeble
   seed, as he himself shows, (Matthew 13:31, 32; Mark 4:32,) and as we
   see by daily examples; for in the uninterrupted progress of his kingdom
   the same things must happen as were seen in his person.

   And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him. He now begins to speak
   of Christ plainly and without a figure; for it was enough to have
   represented the consolation under that figure, in order that the full
   contrast between the burning of the wood and its springing up anew
   might be made manifest. Two states of the people are described by him;
   for, after having explained the calamity, he next added the hope of
   restoration, though the commencement of it was from a slender branch.
   But now he plainly shows what will be the nature of the redemption, and
   what will be the condition of Christ and of his kingdom.

   Some think that this should rather be viewed as referring to Hezekiah;
   but how groundless that opinion is we have already shown; [179] for
   when he was born, David had still a flourishing reputation, and the
   rank of royalty belonged to his descendants; and Hezekiah was very far
   from attaining that greatness which is shortly afterwards described.
   Now, hence we infer that the spiritual kingdom of Christ was formerly
   promised to the ancient people, because his whole strength, power, and
   majesty, is here made to consist in the gifts of the Spirit. Although
   Christ was not deficient in gifts of this kind, yet as he took upon him
   our flesh, it was necessary that he should be enriched with them, that
   we might afterwards be made partakers of all blessings of which
   otherwise we are destitute; for out of his fullness, as John says, we
   must draw as from a fountain. (John 1:16; 7:37, 38.)

   The Spirit of the Lord We must keep in view what I mentioned a little
   ago, that this refers to Christ's human nature; because he could not be
   enriched with the gift and grace of the Father, except so far as he
   became man. Besides, as he came down to us, so he received the gifts of
   the Spirit, that he might bestow them upon us. And this is the
   anointing from which he receives the name of Christ, which he imparts
   to us; for why are we called Christians, but because he admits us to
   his fellowship, by distributing to us out of his fullness according to
   the measure (Ephesians 4:7) of undeserved liberality? And undoubtedly
   this passage does not so much as teach us what Christ is in himself, as
   what he received from the Father, that he might enrich us with his
   wealth.

   The spirit of wisdom and understanding. Though it is not necessary to
   bestow great attention on single words, yet if any person wish to draw
   a slight distinction between wisdom and understanding, I consider it to
   be this, that the word wisdom comprehends generally all that relates to
   the regulation of the life, and that understanding is added for the
   sake of explaining it; for if we are endowed with this wisdom, we shall
   have sagacity enough. Counsel means that judgment by which we can
   thread our way through intricate affairs; for understanding would not
   be sufficient, if there were not also counsel, that we might be able to
   act with caution in doubtful matters. The word might is well enough
   known. Knowledge differs little from understanding; except that it
   relates more to the act of knowing, and thus declares what has taken
   place. The fear of the Lord means a sincere desire to worship God.

   The Prophet does not here enumerate all the gifts of the Holy Spirit,
   as some have thought. Out of this passage the Papists have foolishly
   and ignorantly drawn their sevenfold grace, and some of the ancients
   fell into a similar blunder. He enumerates only six kinds; but they
   have added a seventh out of their own head. But as one error commonly
   follows another, they have chosen to limit the gifts of the Spirit to
   the number seven, although in other parts of Scripture (John 14:17; 2
   Timothy 1:7) he receives numerous and lofty commendations drawn from
   the variety of the effects which he produces. Besides, it is very
   evident that it is through the kindness of Christ (Galatians 5:22, 23)
   that we are partakers of other blessings than those which are here
   enumerated, of meekness, chastity, sobriety, truth, and holiness; for
   these proceed from none else than from Christ. He does not mention,
   therefore, all the gifts which were bestowed on Christ, for that was
   unnecessary; but only shows briefly that Christ came not empty-handed,
   but well supplied with all gifts, that he might enrich us with them.

   If these things had not been added, we might have supposed, as the Jews
   commonly do, that the restoration of this kingdom was carnal, and might
   have imagined that Christ was poor and destitute of all blessings.
   Accordingly, the Prophet afterwards shows that the gifts of the Spirit
   are laid up in him, first, generally, and next, particularly; that we
   may go to him to obtain whatever we want. He will enlighten us with the
   light of wisdom and understanding, will impart to us counsel in
   difficulties, will make us strong and courageous in battles, will
   bestow on us the true fear of God, that is, godliness, and, in a word,
   will communicate to us all that is necessary for our life and
   salvation. All gifts are here included by the Prophet, so that it is
   excessively foolish to attempt to conceal those which do not belong to
   the present enumeration.

   He shows that they dwell in Christ, in order that they may be
   communicated to us. We are also called his fellows, (Psalms 45:7,)
   because strength proceeds from him as the head to the individual
   members, and in like manner Christ causes his heavenly anointing to
   flow over the whole body of his Church. Hence it follows that those who
   are altogether barren and dry have no interest in Christ, and falsely
   glory in his name. Whenever therefore we feel that we are in want of
   any of these gifts, let us blame our unbelief; for true faith makes us
   partakers of all Christ's benefits. We ought therefore to pray to the
   Lord not to permit the lusts of the flesh to rule in us, that Christ
   may wholly unite us to himself. It should also be observed, that we
   ought to ask all blessings from Christ alone; for we are mistaken if we
   imagine that anything can be obtained from the Father in any other way.

   3. And will make him sagacious. [180] The verb rych, (riach,) which is
   here put in the Hiphil conjugation, signifies literally to smell; but
   may also be explained in an active sense, as meaning to give a keen
   smell; which agrees better, I think, with this passage, so that this
   sagacity may be also included among the gifts of the Spirit. And this
   effect is peculiarly applicable to the person of Christ, namely, that
   far beyond what the godly are able to conceive, he is endowed with
   shrewd discernment for governing his people. We ought to attend, first
   of all, to the metaphor in the verb smell, which means that Christ will
   be so shrewd that he will not need to learn from what he hears, or from
   what he sees; for by smelling alone he will perceive what would
   otherwise be unknown. [181]

   In the fear of the Lord. This phrase is viewed by the greater part of
   commentators as meaning that all the feelings of the heart will be
   manifest to Christ, so that he will easily judge who are the sincere
   worshippers of God. But let the reader inquire if it be not a more
   appropriate meaning, that the fear of God denotes a fixed rule of
   judging. He expressly distinguishes between the heavenly judgment of
   Christ and earthly judgments, in order to inform us, that the outward
   mask of holiness or uprightness is of no avail in his presence.

   And he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes. The meaning is,
   "When we come to the judgment-seat of Christ, not only will outward
   actions be brought to trial after the manner of human governments, but
   the life of men will be examined by the standard of true godliness. It
   does not belong to man to penetrate into the hearts; and those whom we
   suppose to be very excellent men have frequently nothing but a hollow
   mask; but Christ judges not from outward appearance, (Luke 11:17; John
   2:25,) for he thoroughly knows and searches our inmost thoughts. His
   judgment, therefore, is quite different from that of men, who, with all
   their acuteness and quick sagacity, fall into the most shameful
   mistakes." Hence it follows that none can be the true worshippers of
   God but those whom Christ approves. They cannot obtain his approbation,
   unless they offer a pure and upright mind; for a false and hollow mask
   cannot deceive him.

   4. For he will judge the poor in righteousness. [182] Here he shows
   that Christ will be the guardian of the poor, or, he points out the
   persons to whom the grace of Christ strictly belongs, namely, to the
   poor or meek; that is, to those who, humbled by a conviction of their
   poverty, have laid aside those proud and lofty dispositions which
   commonly swell the minds of men, till they have learned to be meek
   through the subduing influence of the word of God. He therefore
   declares that he will be the protector and guardian, not of all men
   whatsoever, but of those who know that they are poor, and destitute of
   everything good. This was also declared by Christ to John's disciples,
   when he said that the gospel is preached to the poor. (Matthew 11:5.)
   Who are they that are capable of receiving this doctrine? Not all men
   without exception, but those who, having laid aside the glory of the
   flesh, betake themselves to that heavenly protection.

   There is, therefore, an implied contrast, namely, that Christ does not
   rule over the rich, that is, over those who are swelled with a false
   opinion of themselves. Though he invites all men to come to him, still
   the greater part refuse to submit to his government. The poor alone
   allow themselves to be governed by him. This passage teaches us, that
   if we are desirous to be protected by the power of Christ, we must lay
   aside all pride, and put on the spirit of meekness and modesty. That
   spiritual poverty which the Prophet recommends to all the members of
   Christ is, to have no lofty views, but to be truly humbled by a
   conviction of our poverty and nakedness, so as to depend on Christ
   alone. When we have been brought to this state of mind, the faithful
   King and Guardian will undertake to secure our salvation, and will
   defend us to the last against all our enemies. We also learn whom
   Christ invites to come to him: Come to me, all ye that labor and are
   burdened. (Matthew 11:28.) We must, therefore, labor and be pressed
   down by the weight of our burden, if we wish to feel and know his
   assistance.

   And will reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. We must attend
   to the order which is here observed by the Prophet. He places poverty
   first, and then meekness; because we must first be poor before we
   become meek. So long as we think that we are somebody, (Acts 5:36,) and
   are carried away by a vain confidence in ourselves, our heart is filled
   with pride and self-conceit, and cannot yield or submit; but when we
   are convinced of our poverty, we lose courage, and, subdued and
   overpowered, begin to groan under the burden. The condition of Christ's
   people, therefore, is here described, as he had formerly illustrated
   the nature of the king himself. Hence also we ought to learn, that
   those precious gifts of the Spirit with which we saw a little before
   that Christ was furnished, [183] are not bestowed by him on all men
   whatsoever, but on the poor and the meek; for the word judge denotes
   government, a very important part of which is, that Christ imparts to
   us the gifts which he received from the Father, that he may live in us,
   and that we may live in him.

   And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth. The Prophet
   here extols the efficacy of the word, which is Christ's royal scepter.
   By the rod of his mouth is meant a scepter which consists in words, and
   in the second clause he repeats the same idea by the phrase, the breath
   of his lips; as if he had said, that Christ will have no need to borrow
   aid from others to cast down his enemies, and to strike down everything
   that opposes his government; for a mere breath or a word will be
   enough. The statement may be general, since believers also must die, so
   as to be renewed to a spiritual life; and in this sense the gospel is
   called a sword appropriated for the slaying of sacrifices. (Romans
   15:16.) But the latter part of the verse calls for a different
   interpretation. If any one choose to make a distinction, the striking
   of the earth will apply equally to the reprobate and the elect; as the
   gospel is

   a two-edged sword, piercing even to the most hidden and secret feelings
   of the heart, and discerning the thoughts and affections. (Hebrews
   4:12.)

   Yet it wounds the former in a very different manner from that in which
   it wounds the latter. By mortifying in the elect a sinful nature, it
   kills their lusts, that they may become a living sacrifice, and a
   sacrifice of sweet-smelling savor; but it strikes the wicked in a
   manner altogether destructive, for they rot and die, and to them it is
   even, as Paul says, a savor of death to death. (2 Corinthians 2:16.) I
   should be willing enough to consider both effects as described here at
   the same time, were it not that it is opposed by the custom of the
   Hebrew language; for the Hebrew writers often repeat the same sentiment
   in different words.

   And with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. Christ is
   armed with the breath of his lips to slay the wicked. But perhaps this
   second clause was added by Isaiah for the purpose of amplification;
   and, indeed, to slay is much more than to strike. As it belongs to the
   gospel to cast down all men without exception, its effect on the
   reprobate may be said to be accidental, to slay them with a deadly
   stroke. In this way the Prophet would add a particular case to the
   general statement, intimating that the wicked fall under the sword of
   Christ to their everlasting destruction, because they are not set apart
   to be sacrifices. [184] However this may be, this latter clause must
   undoubtedly be limited to the wicked alone; and it is added, because
   that efficacy does not immediately appear in the preaching of the
   gospel, but, on the contrary, many ridicule, and jeer, and treat as a
   fable all that is said about Christ and his word. But though they do
   not immediately feel its power, yet they will not be able to escape it,
   and will at length be slain by a deadly wound.

   But the Prophet's meaning, I think, is not yet fully explained; for he
   does not speak only of the inward feeling by which wicked men are
   moved, whether they will or not, but of the wickedness itself, which
   will be removed and driven away by the power and efficacy of this
   scepter, as Paul also explains; for he undoubtedly alludes to this
   passage when he speaks of the destruction of Antichrist.

   And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume
   with the breath of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of
   his coming. (2 Thessalonians 2:7,8.)

   Thus he explains to us the meaning of the Prophet; for he shows that
   Christ will never be without enemies, who will endeavor to overturn his
   kingdom, and to hinder or retard the course of the gospel; otherwise
   these words of the Prophet would have been spoken in vain. But Christ
   will drive away some of their number, and the whole of them together,
   and their very head and leader, by the sound of his doctrine.

   Thus also Paul recommends a twofold use of doctrine, demanding from a
   pastor that

   he shall be qualified not only to teach, but likewise
   to refute those who oppose. (Titus 1:9.)

   A pastor ought not only to feed his flock, but also to protect and
   guard them against every injury. This is what Christ performs, and
   therefore he is provided with necessary armor, that he may contend
   successfully against the falsehoods of Satan, and the cruelty of
   tyrants, and every kind of enemies.

   Hence it is evident that wicked doctrines cannot be driven away by any
   other method than by the gospel. In vain will the magistrate employ the
   sword, which undoubtedly he must employ, to restrain wicked teachers
   and false prophets; in vain, I say, will he attempt all these things,
   unless this sword of the word go before. (Deuteronomy 13:5.) This ought
   to be carefully observed in opposition to the Papists, who, when the
   word fails them, betake themselves to new weapons, by the aid of which
   they think that they will gain the victory. They are even so impudent
   as to boast that heretics cannot be refuted by the word, though both
   the Prophet and Paul lay down no other method.

   When the Prophet says, by the breath of his lips, this must not be
   limited to the person of Christ; for it refers to the word which is
   preached by his ministers. Christ acts by them in such a manner that he
   wishes their mouth to be reckoned as his mouth, and their lips as his
   lips; that is, when they speak from his mouth, and faithfully declare
   his word. (Luke 10:16.) The Prophet does not now send us to secret
   revelations, that Christ may reign in us, but openly recommends the
   outward preaching of doctrine, and shows that the gospel serves the
   purpose of a scepter in the hand of Christ, so far as it is preached,
   and so far as it is oral, if we may use the expression; otherwise it
   would have been to no purpose to mention the mouth and the lips. Hence
   it follows that all those who reject the outward preaching of the
   gospel shake off this scepter, as far as lies in their power, or pull
   it out of the hand of Christ; not that the efficacy which he mentions
   depends on the voice of men, but so far as Christ acts by his
   ministers; for he does not wish that their labor should be fruitless,
   without sacrificing the elect to obedience, (Romans 15:16,) and slaying
   the reprobate; as Paul in another passage boasts that there will be
   speedy vengeance against all unbelievers and rebels.

   Here we must again call to remembrance what is the nature of Christ's
   kingdom. As he does not wear a golden crown or employ earthly armor, so
   he does not rule over the world by the power of arms, or gain authority
   by gaudy and ostentatious display, or constrain his people by terror
   and dread; but the doctrine of the gospel is his royal banner, which
   assembles believers under his dominion. Wherever, therefore, the
   doctrine of the Gospel is preached in purity, there we are certain that
   Christ reigns; and where it is rejected, his government is also set
   aside. Hence it is evident how foolishly the Papists boast that the
   Church belongs to them, when they order Christ himself to be silent,
   and cannot endure the sound of his voice, but proclaim aloud, with
   distended cheeks, their own edicts, laws, decrees, and tyrannical
   regulations.

   5. And righteousness shall be the belt. [185] Some translate it girdle;
   but as the Prophet represents Christ to us wearing, as it were, the
   emblems of royalty, I have rather translated it belt, which is also a
   royal emblem, in the same manner as the scepter, which he had assigned
   to him a little before. When Job speaks of taking away the authority of
   kings, he says that the Lord will ungird their belt. (Job 12:18.) To be
   girded with a belt, therefore, is nothing else than to be exalted to
   royal authority, as we shall afterwards see in another passage. (Isaiah
   14:5.)

   The Prophet describes two ornaments belonging to the belt. These are
   righteousness and truth; unless it be thought that there is a change in
   the order of construction, as if he had said that Christ will be girded
   with true righteousness; for truth is not added as if it were different
   from righteousness, but in order to point out the nature of that
   righteousness with which Christ is girded. Some think that
   righteousness here denotes that which Christ imparts to us, that it may
   dwell, not only in himself, but in his members. Faith or truth they
   understand to be that by which we embrace the salvation which he offers
   to us.

   The Chaldee paraphrast explains it thus; "and the righteous shall be
   round about him, believing worshippers shall approach to him." [186]
   But I adopt a more simple interpretation, as if he had said, "He shall
   not appear like kings, clothed with purple and a crown, or girded with
   a belt; but righteousness and truth shall shine forth in him." I
   acknowledge, indeed, that righteousness is not confined to Christ, but
   belongs to his members; but we must attend to the mode of expression,
   that Christ comes forth to govern his people girded with righteousness,
   which he afterwards imparts to them by the secret influence of the
   Spirit. If we distinguish between the word 'mvnh (emunah) and
   righteousness, I consider it to mean faithfulness or steadfastness; as
   if he had said that Christ never disappoints his followers, for he
   continues always to be like himself.

   6. The wolf shall dwell with the lamb. He again returns to describe the
   character and habits of those who have submitted to Christ. As there is
   a mutual relation between the king and the people, he sometimes ascends
   from the body to the head, and sometimes descends from the head to the
   body; and we have already seen that Christ reigns, not for himself, but
   for those who believe in him. Hence it follows that he forms their
   minds by his heavenly Spirit. But the Prophet's discourse looks beyond
   this; for it amounts to a promise that there will be a blessed
   restoration of the world. He describes the order which was at the
   beginning, before man's apostasy produced the unhappy and melancholy
   change under which we groan. Whence comes the cruelty of brutes, which
   prompts the stronger to seize and rend and devour with dreadful
   violence the weaker animals? There would certainly have been no discord
   among the creatures of God, if they had remained in their first and
   original condition. When they exercise cruelty towards each other, and
   the weak need to be protected against the strong, it is an evidence of
   the disorder (ataxias) which has sprung from the sinfulness of man.
   Christ having come, in order to reconcile the world to God by the
   removal of the curse, it is not without reason that the restoration of
   a perfect state is ascribed to him; as if the Prophets had said that
   that golden age will return in which perfect happiness existed, before
   the fall of man and the shock and ruin of the world which followed it.
   Thus, God speaks by Hosea:

   I will make a covenant with the beast of the field, with the fowl of
   the heaven, and with the creeping things.
   (Hoseah 2:18.)

   As if he had said, "When God shall have been reconciled to the world in
   Christ, he will also give tokens of fatherly kindness, so that all the
   corruptions which have arisen from the sinfulness of man will cease."

   In a word, under these figures the Prophets teach the same truth which
   Paul plainly affirms, that Christ came to gather together out of a
   state of disorder those things which are in heaven and which are on
   earth. (Ephesians 1:10; Colossians 1:20.) It may be thus summed up:
   "Christ will come to drive away everything hurtful out of the world,
   and to restore to its former beauty the world which lay under the
   curse." For this reason, he says, that straw will be the food of the
   lion as well as of the ox; for if the stain of sin had not polluted the
   world, no animal would have been addicted to prey on blood, but the
   fruits of the earth would have sufficed for all, according to the
   method which God had appointed. (Genesis 1:30.)

   Though Isaiah says that the wild and the tame beasts will live in
   harmony, that the blessing of God may be clearly and fully manifested,
   yet he chiefly means what I have said, that the people of Christ will
   have no disposition to do injury, no fierceness or cruelty. They were
   formerly like lions or leopards, but will now be like sheep or lambs;
   for they will have laid aside every cruel and brutish disposition. By
   these modes of expression he means nothing else than that those who
   formerly were like savage beasts will be mild and gentle; for he
   compares violent and ravenous men to wolves and bears which live on
   prey and plunder, and declares that they will be tame and gentle, so
   that they will be satisfied with ordinary food, and will abstain from
   doing any injury or harm. On this subject it is proper to argue from
   the less to the greater. "If Christ shall bring brute animals into a
   state of peace, much more will brotherly harmony exist among men, who
   will be governed by the same spirit of meekness." And yet Isaiah does
   not mean that any are mild and peaceful by nature before they are
   renewed, but yet he promises, that whatever may have been their natural
   disposition, they will lay aside or conquer their fierceness, and will
   be like lambs and sheep.

   And a little child shall lead them. This means that beasts which
   formerly were cruel and untameable, will be ready to yield cheerful
   obedience, so that there will be no need of violence to restrain their
   fierceness. Yet we must attend to the spiritual meaning which I
   noticed, that all who become Christ's followers will obey Christ,
   though they may formerly have been savage wild beasts, and will obey
   him in such a manner, that as soon as he lifts his finger, they will
   follow his footsteps, as it is said that his people shall be willing.
   (Psalm 110:3.) Those who are not endued with this meekness do not
   deserve to be ranked among the sheep. Let us, therefore, permit
   ourselves to be ruled and governed by him, and let us willingly submit
   to those whom he has appointed over us, though they appear to be like
   little children. Besides, I think that the ministers of the word are
   compared to children, because they have no external power, and exercise
   no civil government over them.

   A question arises, Do we find any persons who are meek, though they
   have not been tamed by the gospel? The Prophet appears to insinuate
   this, when he compares some men to sheep, and others to wolves and
   bears; and certainly among men who follow the bent of their natural
   disposition, we shall perceive an astonishing diversity. Some are mild
   and gentle, others are fierce and violent; but it is certain that all
   men are untamed till Christ subdues them by the gospel; all are swelled
   with ambition and pride before they are cured by this medicine. Many
   will be able to make a false and hollow profession of modesty and
   humility, but they will swell with inward pride. In short, where the
   Spirit of Christ is not, there will be no true meekness.

   8. And the child shall play on the hole of the asp. He continues to
   illustrate the same sentiment, that when men have been brought into a
   state of favor with God, and have been cleansed from their depravity by
   the Spirit of regeneration, they will likewise be free from every
   hurtful disposition. There is no reason why men dread the danger or
   poison arising from the bite of serpents, but because they do not
   deserve that God should place every part of the world under their
   control. And, indeed, since animals are permitted to do injury even to
   children, this shows that the whole race of Adam has been stained with
   pollution from the very womb.

   We must again observe the comparison which we stated, that those men
   whom a concealed poison led to deeds of violence will have their
   disposition changed, and will do no harm even to little children. Some
   men are openly fierce and cruel, (Psalm 140:3,) and others inwardly
   carry and cherish their malice like poison, (Psalm 55:21,) as David
   also describes them; for some men are more quick, and others are more
   slow, to manifest the desire of doing injury. Whatever they may have
   formerly been, he means that all of them must be cleansed from
   wickedness, both open and concealed, after having submitted to Christ.
   He means, also, that henceforth safety, which will reign everywhere,
   will be enjoyed even by those who have no kind of protection; so that
   they will freely venture to expose themselves to imminent dangers.

   9. They shall not hurt. He now declares plainly, that men themselves,
   having laid aside the depravity which naturally dwells in them, will be
   inclined, of their own accord, to do what is right. He speaks of
   believers who have been truly regenerated to a new life, (Romans 6:4;)
   for though in the Church many hypocrites full of wickedness were mixed
   with the elect of God, yet they are like the Ishmaelites, whom God will
   cast out at the proper time. We ought also to observe, as we are taught
   in Psalm 15:1, 24:3, that those only who follow righteousness have a
   settled residence in the temple of God, that they may dwell there for
   ever. It is, therefore, a distinguishing mark of the genuine members of
   the Church, that they are free from all desire of doing injury to
   others. Hence, also, we infer, that it is a remarkable gift of the
   Spirit of Christ, that men abstain from being evil-doers; for by
   nature, ambition, pride, cruelty, and avarice, always prompt them
   freely and voluntarily to commit acts of injustice.

   For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord. With good
   reason does the Prophet add, that this invaluable blessing flows from
   the knowledge of God; for it abases all flesh, and teaches men to
   commit themselves to his trust and guardianship, and brings them into a
   state of brotherly harmony, when they learn that they have the same
   Father. (Malachi 2:10.) Although many, who have not yet been renewed by
   the Spirit of Christ, profess to have humanity, yet it is certain that
   self-love (philautian) reigns in them; for in all it is natural and so
   deeply-rooted, that they seek their own advantage and not that of
   others, think that they are born for themselves and not for others, and
   would wish to make the whole world subject to them, if they could, as
   Plato has judiciously observed. Hence arise fraud, perjury, theft,
   robbery, and innumerable crimes of this sort; and therefore there is no
   other remedy for subduing this lawless desire than the knowledge of
   God. We see how the Prophet again makes the government of Christ to
   rest on faith and the doctrine of the gospel, as indeed he does not
   gather us to himself (Ephesians 1:10) in another way than by
   enlightening our minds to reveal the heavenly life, which is nothing
   else, as he himself declares, than

   to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. (John
   17:3.)

   As with waters that cover the sea. There is an implied comparison
   between the abundance of knowledge and that slender taste which God
   gave to the ancient people under the law. The Jews having been kept in
   the rudiments of childhood, (Galatians 3:23,4:3,) the perfect light of
   wisdom hath fully shone on us by the gospel, as was also foretold by
   Jeremiah:

   They shall not every one teach his neighbor, and a man his brother, to
   know God; for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
   (Jeremiah 31:34.)

   If this fullness of knowledge take possession of our minds, it will
   free us from all malice.

   This passage also instructs us what is the character of the Church
   under Popery, where the light of doctrine is choked and almost
   extinguished, and the highest religion is made to consist in the
   benumbing influence of brutish stupidity. If we do not immediately
   possess full knowledge, we must advance from day to day, and make
   continual progress, (2 Peter 3:18,) and in such a manner that fruit may
   spring from that root. Hence it is evident how little progress the
   greater part have made in the school of Christ, seeing that fraud and
   robbery and acts of violence abound everywhere.

   10. And it shall be in that day the root of Jesse. He again returns to
   the person of Christ, and repeats the same comparison which he had
   introduced at the beginning of the chapter, that of a root or a branch
   springing from a decayed trunk, of which no trace appeared; and he
   foretells that the Gentiles, who formerly abhorred the Jews, will
   henceforth bow before their King with lowly homage. This might be
   thought to be altogether incredible, and unquestionably the promise was
   ridiculed for many centuries, because such a gathering together was to
   be expected rather when the kingdom remained and flourished than when
   it had been cut down. But it was necessary that it should be cut down,
   so that it might afterwards sprout again, and that the glory and power
   of God might shine in it more brighter than in its flourishing
   condition. Who would have seen with the eyes of men that the branch
   would rise to such a height as to be seen by all nations, and to direct
   the eyes of all men towards it?

   Which shall stand for an ensign of the peoples. He compares it to a
   banner stretched aloft; and we know that this was fulfilled by the
   preaching of the gospel, and indeed was more illustrious than if Christ
   had soared above the clouds. To the same purpose is what he says,

   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of
   man be lifted up. (John 3:14; Numbers 21:9.)

   Shall be sought by the Gentiles. Christ is said to be sought, when men
   flee to him for the purpose of asking salvation, as to seek God means,
   in every part of Scripture, to cast all our hopes upon him.
   Accordingly, the Greek translators have rendered it elpiousi, they
   shall hope, looking rather at the meaning than at the word.

   And his rest shall be glory. These words are commonly explained as
   referring to the burial of Christ, and that by a figure of speech in
   which a part is taken for the whole; for afterwards they apply it also
   to his death; and indeed the burial of Christ was nothing else than an
   appendage to his death. They think that the meaning is this, "The death
   of Christ, which was disgraceful in the eyes of the world, will be
   glorious and splendid." But when I take a closer view of the whole, by
   rest the Prophet means in this passage the Church; as it is also said,

   This is my everlasting rest; here will I dwell.
   (Psalm 132:14.)

   He bestows an honorable appellation on the assembly of the godly,
   because he chooses to have a continual habitation among them.
   Accordingly, the Church having been at that time exposed to reproaches
   and disgrace, he promises that it will be again raised to a more
   prosperous condition, and will recover its ancient glory. Here,
   therefore, we have a remarkable proof that God is pleased to dwell
   continually in his Church, though this may not always be seen by men.

   11. And it shall be in that day, the Lord will again set his hand. The
   prediction about the future glory of the Church having been incredible,
   he explains the method of restoring it, namely, that God will display
   the power of his hand, as if for performing a memorable and uncommon
   exploit. Now, to confirm the hope of the elect people, he recalls to
   their minds the remembrance of a past deliverance, that they may not
   doubt that God is as able to deliver them now as their fathers found
   him to be in Egypt. (Exodus 12:51.) Such is the import of the word
   snyt, (shenith,) that is, the second time, or again; as if he had said,
   "Now also will God be the deliverer of his Church."

   To possess the remnant of his people. He confirms what he has said by
   another argument; for though it appeared as if God had disregarded his
   people, yet he will not allow himself to be deprived of his
   inheritance. We may sum it up by saying, that God will take care of the
   salvation of his Church, so as not to be robbed of his right. He
   expressly calls them a remnant, because this deliverance belonged only
   to a small seed. (Isaiah 1:9,10:22.) In short, he repeats what he
   formerly said, "Though God disperse and scatter his Church, yet it is
   impossible that he can ever cast it away altogether; for it is as dear
   to him as our inheritance is to any of us."

   Which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt. He speaks not only of
   the Assyrians, who had led the people captive, but also of other
   nations among whom the Jews were scattered; for though the greater part
   of the people was carried to Babylon, some fled into Egypt, some into
   Ethiopia, and some into other countries. They were afraid lest they
   should endure the same bondage as had been endured by others. Some
   think that by Pathros is meant Parthia, which is highly probable;
   others think that it is Arabia the Rocky. Under the name Elam he
   includes the Medes, Zocdians, Bactrians, and other eastern nations.
   Shinar belongs to Chaldea. By Hamath they mean Cilicia, and the other
   countries which lie towards Mount Taurus. By the word islands the Jews
   mean all countries that lie beyond the sea; for to them Greece, and
   Italy, and Spain, were islands, because they were separated from them
   by the sea. [187]

   We see that the Prophet speaks here not only of the deliverance which
   took place under Zerubbabel, (Ezra 2:2,) but that he looks beyond this;
   for at that time the Israelites were not brought back from Egypt,
   Ethiopia, and other countries. These words, therefore, cannot be
   understood to relate to the deliverance from Babylon, but must be
   viewed as referring to the kingdom of Christ, under whom this
   deliverance was obtained through the preaching of the gospel. Besides,
   it is proper to observe that this work belongs to God, and not to men;
   for he says, The Lord shall stretch out his arm; thus ascribing to his
   heavenly power this work, which could not have been accomplished by
   human ability.

   It ought also to be observed, that from God's past benefits we ought
   always to entertain good hopes for the future; so that whenever we call
   to remembrance the deliverances from Babylon and from Egypt, (Ezra 2:2;
   Exodus 12:51,) we may be convinced that God is equally able, and will
   equally assist us at the present day, that he may restore the Church to
   her ancient glory. What he did once and again, he is able to do a third
   time, and a fourth, and many times. When the Prophet calls those whom
   he rescues a remnant, let us learn that we ought not to desire a vast
   multitude, and let us be satisfied, though we be few, and let us not be
   terrified by the smallness of our numbers; for, provided that the
   righteousness of God abound, we have true and abundant ground of
   confidence.

   12. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations. This verse contains
   nothing more than the explanation of the former verse. The language is
   metaphorical, and admits of two meanings; either that, by giving an
   ensign, he will terrify adversaries, so that they will not dare to
   prevent his people from returning, or that he will give an ensign to
   the wretched exiles not to hesitate to make preparations for their
   return. But even at the present day this doctrine is highly useful
   among us; for as an ensign is lifted up in the army, that the soldiers
   may assemble, and that every one may follow and may keep his proper
   place, so a banner is here held out to us, that we may assemble to it,
   namely, the gospel, which the Lord has lifted up among the Gentiles, by
   which Christ is preached to us. [188]

   And will gather together the dispersions of Judah. Hence we ought to
   conclude, that we cannot be gathered by the Lord unless we assemble to
   this ensign, and be joined to him by faith; for there is no other way
   in which he acknowledges us to be his sheep, than when, after having
   been scattered, we are gathered together, and meet in the same assembly
   under this ensign; as he says,

   My sheep hear my voice and follow me. (John 10:27.)

   The word gather is repeated. He will gather together the outcasts of
   Israel, and will gather together the dispersions of Judah. He shows how
   efficacious God's calling will be; for as soon as he shall give the
   slightest indication that such is his pleasure, he will restore the
   people. Dispersion is a collective noun, for it means the Jews
   scattered in all directions; and he appears to allude, as he often does
   elsewhere, to similar passages in the writings of Moses, in which the
   Lord promises that he will gather the people, though they were
   scattered to the farthest parts of the world, and to the four winds of
   heaven. (Deuteronomy 30:3, 4.) Now, this was done under the direction
   of Christ. Under the same leader we ought at the present day to expect
   the restoration of a wretched and scattered Church; for there is no
   hope of gathering the remnant but by the elect looking to this ensign.
   We ought frequently, therefore, to call to remembrance those promises,
   that by relying on them we may more and more strengthen our hearts.

   13. And the envy of Ephraim shall depart. Here he promises that the
   Church will be in such a state of peace, that neither will the
   Israelites and the Jews contend in civil broils, nor will they suffer
   any annoyance from their enemies, and that they will not be liable to
   hatred or envy, as they formerly were. Not that there will be no wicked
   men, but the Lord will at length cut off and destroy them. But we ought
   chiefly to observe what he adds about allaying domestic quarrels, that
   henceforth the children of Abraham may not harass each other, but unite
   in the same religion, and in the pure worship of God; for it was a
   disgraceful and shocking spectacle that their mutual strife and
   hostilities had been so long maintained.

   With good reason does he point out the source of quarrels, namely,
   envy, in consequence of which the descendants of Abraham have torn each
   other, while the tribes of Judah and Ephraim strive with each other for
   renown. This horrible torch has always kindled wars in the world, while
   every man is unwilling to yield. In short, the Lord here promises
   outward and inward peace, which is a very great and most desirable
   blessing.

   It will be objected that this was never accomplished, and that the very
   opposite of this took place; for as soon as the gospel began, it was
   followed by various wars, commotions, and dreadful persecutions, and
   nearly the whole world was disturbed and shaken. And inwardly what
   peace did the Church enjoy? Among Christians themselves, Satan, by his
   tares, (Matthew 13:25,) has raised up dreadful disturbances, so that no
   enemies were more ferocious and destructive than those which were
   brought up in the bosom of the Church.

   I reply, the Prophet here includes the whole of Christ's kingdom, and
   not merely a single age or century. In this world we taste but the
   beginning of Christ's kingdom; and while the Church is harassed by
   enemies both within and without, still the Lord defends and preserves
   her, and conquers all her enemies. Besides, this prediction properly
   belongs to the true and lawful children of Abraham, whom the Lord has
   purified by the cross and by banishment, and has constrained to lay
   aside ambition and envy; as those who have been tamed in the school of
   Christ cease to be desirous of renown. Thus the promise which Isaiah
   makes in this passage has already been in part fulfilled, and is
   fulfilled every day. But we must proceed in these exercises, and must
   fight earnestly within and without, till we obtain that everlasting
   peace which it will be our happiness to enjoy in the kingdom of God.

   14. And they shall fly on the shoulders of the Philistines. He means
   that there is also another way in which the Lord will assist his
   people; which is, that he will conquer their enemies, and subdue them
   under his dominion. Having spoken of the safety of the Church, he now
   declares that she will be victorious over her enemies. He mentions
   those nations with which the Jews incessantly carried on wars; for on
   the one hand the Philistines, and on the other the Ammonites and
   Moabites, to whom they were bound by the tie of relationship and
   kindred, were continually molesting and attacking them. On one side
   also were the Edomites, who were not restrained by blood-relationship
   from being most determined enemies; for they were descended from Esau,
   (Genesis 25:25, 26, 36:1,8, 9,) the brother of Jacob; and the
   remembrance of this ought to have dissuaded them from enmity and
   hatred. The Lord, therefore, promises that the Church, though she is
   not absolutely without enemies, will gain advantage over them by
   suffering, and in the end be victorious.

   Edom and Moab shall be the stretching out of the hands. [189] The
   stretching out of the hands means the dominion which the Church
   obtained over her enemies; for by the word hand is usually meant power;
   and the Hebrews use the phrase, to stretch out the hand, instead of "to
   place this or that under subjection." Thus it is said,

   I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
   (Psalm 89:25.)

   The stretching out of the hand, therefore, is full power to rule; and,
   on the other hand, he adds the obedience which the enemies will yield
   to her: and the children of Ammon shall be their obedience [190]

   The Jews, who dream of an earthly kingdom of Christ, interpret all this
   in a carnal sense, and apply it to I know not what external power; but
   they ought rather to judge of it according to the nature of Christ's
   kingdom. Partly, no doubt, the accomplishment of this prediction was
   seen, when the Jews returned from captivity, and God brought them into
   moderate prosperity, contrary to the wish, and in spite of the
   opposition, of all the neighboring nations; but believers were led to
   expect a more splendid victory, which they at length obtained through
   the preaching of the gospel. Although we must continually fight under
   the cross, yet we vanquish our enemies, when we are rescued from the
   tyranny of the devil and of wicked men, and are restored to liberty by
   Christ, that the flesh may be subdued, and our lusts laid low, and that
   thus we may live to him, and in patience may possess our souls, (Luke
   21:19,) calmly and patiently enduring everything that happens. And thus
   we even heap coals on the head (Romans 12:20) of enemies, to whose
   attacks and reproaches we appear to be subject.

   15. And the Lord will utterly destroy. In this verse he means nothing
   else than that the Lord, by his amazing power, will open for his people
   a way, which formerly appeared to be shut up. He speaks figuratively.
   What he calls a tongue is "a bay of the sea;" for when the sea
   penetrates into the land, and occupies a part of it, there is a
   resemblance to a person putting out his tongue. He therefore means the
   Egyptian sea and Egypt itself, as he afterwards more fully explains.
   But he chiefly mentions the sea and the rivers, because they protect
   the countries and shut up every entrance.

   And will stretch out the hand over the river in the strength of his
   wind. He undoubtedly means the Nile, which waters the whole of Egypt,
   and divides it into many parts, and might thus interrupt the march of
   the people when returning to their native country. I have no doubt that
   rvch (ruach) here denotes wind, though he adds the Lord's; for all the
   winds are the Lord's, because he regulates and guides according to his
   pleasure; and more especially this phrase is employed when it is
   miraculously agitated by a violent whirlwind. He alludes to the former
   deliverance of his people, by which he brought them out of Egypt; for
   when the Lord was pleased to open up a way for them, he dried up the
   sea by the force and violence of the winds. (Exodus 14:21.)

   True, the Lord did not need the assistance of the winds, for he might
   have done it by an immediate exertion of his power. But when he makes
   use of outward means, let us learn, first, that all creatures are ready
   to yield obedience to him; for though they have a natural course, yet
   they are in his power, so that he can direct their force and violence
   in whatever way he pleases. For instance, when a wind arises, its
   beginning proceeds from a natural cause, and each of the winds has its
   properties. The south wind is moist, and the north wind is cold, and
   completely similar are the effects which proceed from them; for the
   south wind moistens bodies, and the north wind dries them. By
   extraordinary miracles the Lord shows that he possesses an authority
   far above these natural causes, so that they are governed, not by
   nature, (that is, by that succession of events or chain of causes which
   irreligious men imagine to exist,) but by God alone.

   Secondly, he shows that he changes the nature and order of events
   whenever he pleases, that he may be acknowledged to be their only Lord;
   because such a change exhibits more clearly his authority and dominion.
   On this account Isaiah called it not simply the wind, but the wind of
   the Lord, that we may perceive that it is not directed or moved by
   chance, but by the power of the Lord.

   And shall smite it in the seven streams. Some render it torrents, and
   explain it thus: "he will divide the Nile into seven parts." Though
   this exposition has been universally adopted, yet I do not approve of
   it; and I think that it has arisen from forgetfulness, rather than from
   ignorance, on the part of its authors, who are learned men
   notwithstanding, and deeply skilled in the perusal of the ancient
   writers. It is well known from history that the Nile had seven mouths.
   There are others which are little mentioned, because they had no names,
   and are therefore called false mouths. Whatever, then, is the number of
   the mouths or branches, it appears to form that number of streams or
   rivers; and these might have been so many hinderances to retard their
   journey. The Prophet expressly mentions them, because the river was
   highly celebrated.

   And shall make them be shod with shoes. [191] The river being deep, he
   says that he will dry it up, so that it will not be necessary to pull
   off their shoes in crossing it, though this would have been necessary
   if only a small portion of water had remained.

   By these metaphors, therefore, the Prophet means nothing else than that
   nothing will stand in God's way, when it shall be his pleasure to
   rescue his people from captivity. He glances at the history of a former
   deliverance, that they may learn that it will be the same with that
   which they formerly enjoyed. On this account he wished to place it, as
   it were, before their eyes; for the means of this deliverance was not
   seen. If this promise had been stated in plain terms, it might not have
   produced so deep an impression on their minds as by holding out this
   remarkable example.

   16. And there shall be a path. [192] This verse contains nothing new,
   but explains the former verse. The people would perceive the same power
   of God in the deliverance from Babylon as they had perceived in the
   deliverance from Egypt. He had opened up a way through seas, (Exodus
   14:29; Psalm 77:19,) through untrodden deserts, (Deuteronomy 8:2,
   29:5,) and through Jordan; (Joshua 3:16, 17.) In like manner, Isaiah
   says, that by an unexpected and astonishing method he will again open
   up a way for his people to go out. Accordingly, what the Lord has once
   performed let us also expect for the future; and for that purpose let
   us ponder the ancient histories. This ought also to direct our thoughts
   to the final deliverance of the Church, by which we shall all be
   delivered from all troubles and distresses; so that, though what we are
   told about a resurrection and immortal life may appear to be
   incredible, and the means of accomplishing them are not seen by us,
   still the Lord will easily find a way.

   Isaiah Chapter 12:1-6

   1. And in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise thee: though
   thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou
   comfortedst me.

   1. Et dices in die illo: Cantabo tibi Iehova, Tametsi iratus es mihi,
   aversus est furor tuus, et consolatus es me.

   2. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for
   the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my
   salvation.

   2. Ecce Deus salus mea: confidam, et non pavebo. Quoniam fortitudo mea
   et canticum Deus Iehova; factusque est (vel erit) mihi in salutem.

   3. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
   salvation.

   3. Haurietis aquas cum gaudio, de fontibus salvatoris (vel, salutis).

   4. And in that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name,
   declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is
   exalted.

   4. Et dicetis in die illa: Canite Iehovae; invocate nomen ejus;
   celebrate in populis opera ejus; commemorate, quia nomen ejus exaltatum
   est.

   5. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things: this is known
   in all the earth.

   5. Psallite Iehovae, quoniam magnifica gessit; et hoc vulgatum est per
   totam terram.

   6. Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy
   One of Israel in the midst of thee.

   6. Jubila et canta habitatrix Sion; quia magnus in medio tui Sanctus
   Israel.


   1. And thou shalt say in that day. Isaiah now exhorts all the godly to
   thanksgiving. Yet the exhortation has also this object, that the
   promise may be more fully believed; for he seals it with that
   exhortation, that they may be convinced that it is certain, and may not
   think that they are deluded by unfounded hope, when a form of
   thanksgiving is now given, and, as it were, put into their mouth; and
   this would not have been the case, if there had not been just and solid
   grounds. At the same time, he points out the purpose which the Lord has
   in view in doing good in his Church. It is, that the remembrance of his
   name may be extolled; not that he needs our praise, but it is
   profitable to ourselves. We ought also to consider the honor which he
   bestows upon us, when he condescends to make use of our services for
   extolling and spreading the glory of his name, though we are altogether
   useless and of no value.

   Thou shalt say. He addresses the whole people as if he were addressing
   one man, because it was their duty to be so united as to be one. We
   also are taught by the same example that we ought to be united
   together, that there may be one soul and one mouth, (Romans 15:6,) if
   we desire to have our prayers and thanksgivings accepted by God.

   Though thou wast angry with me. The leading thought of this song is,
   that God, though he was justly offended at his people, yet was
   satisfied with inflicting a moderate chastisement, and showed that he
   was willing to be pacified. The particle ky (ki) being sometimes
   expressive of a cause, some render it, I will praise thee, O Lord,
   because, having been angry with me, still thou art immediately
   reconciled; but as it sometimes signifies though, [193] I have adopted
   the rendering which I considered to agree best with this passage.

   Believers, therefore, first acknowledge their guilt, and next ascribe
   it to the mercy of God that they have been freed from their distresses.
   The words being in the future tense, the following interpretation might
   also be adopted: -- "The temporal chastisement will not prevent thee
   from having at length compassion on me, and from giving me ground of
   joy and comfort." Whichsoever of these views be taken, this sentiment
   ought to be carefully observed; for as soon as a conviction of God's
   anger seizes our minds, it prompts us to despair, and if it be not
   seasonably counteracted, it will speedily overwhelm us. Satan also
   tempts us by all methods, and employs every expedient to compel us to
   despair. We ought, therefore, to be fortified by this doctrine, that,
   though we feel the anger of the Lord, we may know that it is of short
   duration, (Psalm 30:5,) and that we shall be comforted as soon as he
   has chastened us.

   When we have been relieved from distresses, let us call to remembrance
   that our punishment is ended, not because we have paid to the justice
   of God what we had deserved, but because through his fatherly love he
   spares our weakness. This confession belongs properly to the godly and
   elect; for though the chastisements of the godly and ungodly appear to
   be the same, yet the reasons of them are exceedingly different. The
   wrath of the Lord against the ungodly is perpetual, and the
   chastisements which are inflicted on them are forerunners of
   everlasting destruction: no alleviation or consolation is promised to
   them. But the godly feel that the wrath of God is of short duration,
   and encourage their hearts by hope and confidence; for they know that
   God will be gracious to them, since he has declared that he punishes
   their sins for no other reason than to train them to repentance, that
   they may not perish along with the world. (1 Corinthians 11:32.)

   2. Behold, God is my salvation. Though it is proper to behold by faith
   the salvation of God in the midst of our afflictions, yet here Isaiah
   speaks of knowledge derived from experience; for he lays down a form of
   a joyful song, in which God shows by outward signs that he is pacified
   towards his Church. Such is also the import of the phrase hnh,
   (hinneh,) Behold; for now the brightness of God's countenance, which
   had been hidden for a time, shines forth, so that they can point to it
   as with the finger. Since, therefore, our punishments fill us with
   dread, and it is impossible for our minds not to be overclouded by our
   sins, as if we had no interest in God's salvation, or as if it were
   withdrawn from us, the Prophet describes here a change of feeling, when
   God is reconciled to us. But this prediction relates chiefly to the
   coming of Christ, which first exhibited fully the salvation of God.

   I will trust and not be afraid. He adds, that when we are fully
   convinced that salvation is laid up for us in God, this is a solid
   foundation of full confidence, and the best remedy for allaying fears.
   But for this we must have trembled, and been uneasy and distressed, and
   tortured by painful emotions. Hence, we conclude, that confidence
   proceeds from faith, as an effect from its cause. By faith we perceive
   that salvation is laid up for us in God, and a calm and peaceful state
   of mind arises from it; but when faith is wanting there can be no peace
   of conscience. Let us therefore know that we have made good progress in
   faith, when we have been endued with such confidence as the Prophet
   describes.

   Besides, this confidence ought to have the chief place in our hearts,
   (Colossians 3:15,) so as to banish all fear and dread; not that we are
   free from all distress and uneasiness, but that assurance will at
   length be victorious. Yet we must keep in mind what I said, that the
   Prophet here speaks of the cheerfulness which believers, who had
   formerly been almost overwhelmed under the load of temptations, obtain,
   when God is reconciled to them.

   For the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength. He states more clearly and more
   expressly that believers will have good reason to sing, because they
   will have known by experience that they are strong in their God, as
   indeed redemption was an illustrious display of the power of God. Since
   Isaiah does not describe the benefit of a single day, but that which
   God had determined to carry forward till the coming of Christ, it
   follows that there are none who sincerely and heartily sing the praises
   of God, but those who, convinced of their weakness, seek to obtain
   strength from God alone in answer to prayer. Nor is he here called a
   part or an aid of our strength, but our complete strength; for we are
   strong, so far as he supplies us with strength.

   And my song. The reason why he is called The song of the godly is, that
   he bestows on them so much kindness for the purpose of exciting them to
   perform the duty of thankfulness. Hence we conclude that the beginning
   of joy springs from the favor of God, and that the end of it is the
   sacrifice of praise. (Psalm 50:23; Hoseah 14:2; Hebrew 13:15.) Thus,
   the hearts of the godly ought to be trained to patience, that they may
   not cease to bless God; but in a state of joy and prosperity their
   mouth is opened, so that they loudly proclaim God's benefits. But since
   the ungodly freely indulge in despising God, and, having laid their
   consciences asleep, riot like brutes in drunken mirth, and never awake
   to praise God, Christ justly curses their joy.

   Wo to you that laugh, for ye shall mourn; your joy shall be turned into
   grief, and your laughter into qnashing of teeth.
   (Luke 6:25.)

   And he hath become my salvation. [194] If it be thought better to take
   this clause in the past tense, the meaning will be, that believers sing
   joyfully, because God hath saved them. But it will be most appropriate
   to take it in the future tense, and he will become my salvation; that
   is, God not only hath been salvation to his people, but will be so to
   the end; for believers ought not to confine their attention to the
   present benefit, but to extend their hope to the uninterrupted progress
   of his favor.

   3. You shall draw waters with joy. In this verse he confirms what we
   have already noticed, that this chapter may be regarded as a seal to
   confirm the promise which he gave about the redemption of his people.
   As if he had said, "The salvation of God hath been set before you, as
   if it were a constant running fountain, from which you can draw waters
   in abundance." This is a very beautiful metaphor; for in this life
   nothing is more necessary than water, so that there is no kind of
   scarcity that gives us more uneasiness or more distress than a scarcity
   of water. Thus, by a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the
   whole, he declares that everything necessary for supporting life flows
   to us from the undeserved goodness of God. And since we are empty and
   destitute of everything good, he appropriately compares the mercy of
   God to a fountain, which satisfies those who are thirsty and dry,
   refreshes those who are parched with heat, and revives those who are
   worn out with fatigue.

   From the fountains of the Savior. [195] This word is more appropriate
   to this passage than if he had said, "from the fountains of God;" for
   it yields more consolation when we know that he is the author of our
   salvation, and therefore the Prophet has skilfully adapted this term to
   the situation in which it is placed. Now, if this promise includes the
   whole of Christ's reign, we ought constantly to apply it to our use.
   Let us therefore know that the goodness of God is held out to us, that
   we may be satisfied with it; for we ought to be like a dry and thirsty
   land, as the Psalmist says, (Psalm 143:6,) that we may desire the
   waters of the Lord. This goodness of God is wonderful and beyond what
   could have been believed, that he does not suffer us to burn with
   unsatisfied desire, but presents a fountain from which we may draw
   abundantly. That fountain is Christ, in whom all God's benefits are
   imparted to us; for out of his fullness, as John says, we all draw.
   (John 1:16.) It remains, therefore, that whenever we feel our want we
   go directly to him.

   4. And in that day shall ye say. He now exhorts them not only to sing
   praise and give thanks to God individually, but to excite others to do
   the same. As he had formerly said, Many people shall go and say, Come
   ye, and let us go up into the mountain of the Lord, (Isaiah 2:3,) that
   is, exciting each other by mutual exhortation to embrace the pure
   worship of God; so after having enjoined them individually to be
   thankful to God, he now also commands them mutually to excite each
   other to thanksgiving. He means that they ought to speak not to one,
   but to all, and not at one time only, but during their whole life.

   Call upon his name. [196] He now gives a short description of the
   manner in which praise is properly rendered to God, when he enjoins us
   to

   call upon him, that we may not glory in any other.
   (Jeremiah 9:23,24.)

   Hence also, by taking a part for the whole, (sunekdochikos,) Scripture
   frequently describes the whole of worship under the designation of
   calling upon God. In this way we show that our confidence is placed in
   God; and this is also what he chiefly demands from us. In like manner,
   I think that here the Prophet connects calling upon God with praises,
   in order to include the whole of the worship of God.

   Make known his works among the peoples. [197] He means that the work of
   this deliverance will be so excellent, that it ought to be proclaimed,
   not in one corner only, but throughout the whole world. He wished,
   indeed, that it should be first made known to the Jews, but that it
   should afterwards spread abroad to all men. This exhortation, by which
   the Jews testified their gratitude, might be regarded as a forerunner
   of the preaching of the gospel, which afterwards followed in the proper
   order. As the Jews proclaimed among the Medes and Persians, and other
   neighboring nations, the favor which had been showed to them, so, when
   Christ was manifested, they ought to have been heralds to sound aloud
   the name of God through every country in the world. Hence it is evident
   what is the desire which ought to be cherished among all the godly. It
   is, that the goodness of God may be made known to all, that all may
   join in the same worship of God. We ought especially to be inflamed
   with this desire, after having been delivered from some alarming
   danger, and most of all after having been delivered from the tyranny of
   the devil and from everlasting death.

   5. Sing unto the Lord He continues his exhortation, showing what is the
   feeling from which this thanksgiving ought to proceed; for he shows
   that it is our duty to proclaim the goodness of God to every nation.
   While we exhort and encourage others, we must not at the same time sit
   down in indolence, but it is proper that we set an example before
   others; for nothing can be more absurd than to see lazy and slothful
   men who are exciting other men to praise God.

   For he hath done glorious things. When he asserts that God hath done
   gloriously, he means that there is abundant ground for singing. The
   Lord does not wish that his praises should be proclaimed without any
   reason, but holds out a very rich and very abundant subject of praise,
   when he frees his people from very hard bondage. We have said that this
   song is not limited to a short period, but, on the contrary, extends to
   the whole of Christ's reign. This work therefore is truly glorious,
   that God sent his Son to reconcile us to himself, (John 3:16, 17,) and
   to destroy the dominion of death and the devil. (Hebrews 2:14.) If,
   therefore, we consider the work of our deliverance as we ought to do,
   we shall have very abundant ground for praising God.

   And this hath been made known through all the earth. When he says that
   this hath been made known, he glances at the calling of the Gentiles,
   and confirms what has been already stated, that the work is such as
   ought not to be concealed in a corner, but to be everywhere proclaimed.

   6. Shout and sing. He again exhorts the godly to rejoice in the Lord,
   at the same time reminding them what is the nature of true joy, and on
   what it is founded. We have no other happiness than to have God
   dwelling in the midst of us. But for this, our life would be wretched
   and unhappy, though we should have abundance of other blessings and of
   every kind of riches. Now, if our heart be set on our treasure,
   (Matthew 6:21,) this happiness will attract all our feelings.

   The Holy One of Israel. He calls him the Holy One, in order to inform
   us what he intends to prove himself to be to us, while he dwells with
   us; that is, that not only his majesty may fill our minds with
   reverence towards him, for it would at the same time overwhelm us with
   terror; but that he may vouchsafe to make us the objects of his
   peculiar care, though separated from the rest of the world. He calls
   him the Holy One, from the effect produced; for, by gathering us to
   himself, (Ephesians 1:10,) and saving us by his grace, he may be said
   to sanctify us to be his own property. Accordingly, if God is with us,
   the conviction of his presence will fill us with inconceivable joy.
   Hence it follows that, when he is absent, we continue to be exposed to
   grief and sadness.

   By the words, Shout and sing, he means that when God magnifies his
   power in the midst of us, he gives us occasion for no ordinary joy.
   Again, by directly addressing the inhabitants of Zion, he intimates
   that all are not capable of so great a blessing, and at the same time
   indirectly exhorts them to maintain unity of faith, that, by being
   united to the Church, we may partake of this blessed joy.

   3. Ego praecepi sanctificatis meis; adeoque vocavi fortes meos ad iram
   meam, laetantes gloria mea.

   4. The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great
   people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
   together: the Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

   4. Vox multitudinis in montibus instar populi multi. Vox sonitus
   regnorum, gentium congregatarum; Iehova exercituum recenset exercitum
   belli.

   6. Ululate; quoniam propinquus est dies Iehovae; quasi vastitas a
   robusto (vel, a vastatore robusto) veniet.

   7. Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall
   melt:

   7. Propterea omnes manus dissolventur, et omne cor hominis liquefiet.

   8. And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them;
   they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed
   one at another; their faces shall be as flames.

   8. Et terrebuntur; angustiae et dolores apprehendent; instar
   parturientis dolebunt; quisque ad proximum suum obstupescet; facies
   flammarum, facies eorum.

   9. Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce
   anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners
   thereof out of it.

   9. Ecce dies Iehovae veniet saevus; et indignatio, et aestus irae, ut
   redigat terram in solitudinem, et sceleratos ejus deleat ex ea.

   10. For the stars of heaven, and the constellations thereof, shall not
   give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the
   moon shall not cause her light to shine.

   10. Itaque stellae coelorum et sidera non expandent lumen suum;
   obtenebratus erit Sol in egressu suo, et Luna non emittet fulgorem
   suum.

   11. And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
   their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,
   and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

   parcet filiis oculus eorum.

   19. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees'
   excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

   19. Et erit Babel, decor regnorum et ornamentum splendoris Chaldaeorum,
   instar subversionis Dei in Sodoma et Gomorrha.

   20. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
   generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there;
   neither shall the shepherds make their fold there:

   20. Nunquam amplius sedebit, neque habitabit in generationem et
   generationem; neque figet illic tabernaculum Arabs, neque pastores
   illic accubare facient gregem.

   21. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses
   shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and
   satyrs shall dance there.

   21. Sed ibi cubabunt Ziim, et domus eorum implebunt Ohim; illic
   habitabunt filiae Struthionis, et illic Satyri saltabunt.

   22. And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
   houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces; and her time is near to
   come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

   22. Et clamabunt Iim in magnificis aedibus eorum, et dracones in
   palatiis voluptuosis; ac tempus quidem ejus prope est, neque
   protrahentur dies ejus.


   1. The burden of Babylon From this chapter down to the twenty-fourth,
   the Prophet foretells what dreadful and shocking calamities awaited the
   Gentiles and those countries which were best known to the Jews, either
   on account of their being contiguous to them, or on account of the
   transactions of commerce and alliances; and he does so not without
   weighty reasons. When various changes are taking place, some think that
   God sports with the affairs of men, and others, that everything is
   directed by the blind violence of fortune, as profane history
   sufficiently testifies; very few are aware that these things are
   appointed and regulated by the purpose of God. There is nothing of
   which it is more difficult to convince men than that the providence of
   God governs this world. Many indeed acknowledge it in words, but very
   few have it actually engraven on their heart. We tremble and shudder at
   the very smallest change, and we inquire into the causes, as if it
   depended on the decision of men. What then shall be done, when the
   whole world is thrown into commotion, and the face of affairs is so
   completely changed in various places, that it appears as if everything
   were going to ruin?

   It was therefore highly useful that Isaiah and other prophets should
   discourse about calamities of this nature, that all might understand
   that those calamities did not take place but by the secret and
   wonderful purpose of God. If they had uttered no prediction on those
   subjects, such a disordered state of affairs might have shaken and
   disturbed the minds of the godly; but when they knew long beforehand
   that this would happen, they had in the event itself a mirror of the
   providence of God. When Babylon was taken, which they had previously
   learned from the mouth of the Prophet, their own experience taught them
   that the prediction had not been made in vain, or without solid
   grounds.

   But there was also another reason why the Lord commanded that the
   destruction of Babylon and other nations should be foretold. These
   predictions were of no advantage to Babylon or the other nations, and
   these writings did not reach them; but by this consolation he intended
   to alleviate the grief of the godly, that they might not be
   discouraged, as if their condition were worse than that of the
   Gentiles; which they would have had good reason to conclude, if they
   had seen them unpunished escape the hand of God. If the monarchy of
   Babylon had remained unshaken, the Jews would not only have thought
   that it was in vain for them to worship God, and that his covenant
   which he had made with Abraham had not been fulfilled, since it fared
   better with strangers and wicked men than with the elect people; but a
   worse suspicion might have crept into their minds, that God showed
   favor to accursed robbers, who gave themselves up to deeds of
   dishonesty and violence, and despised all law both human and divine.
   Indeed, they might soon have come to think that God did not care for
   his people, or could not assist them, or that everything was directed
   by the blind violence of fortune. Accordingly, that they might not
   faint or be thrown into despair, the Prophet meets them with the
   consoling influence of this prediction, showing that the Babylonians
   also will be punished.

   Besides, the comparison taught them how severe was the punishment that
   awaited them, which they had knowingly and willingly brought upon
   themselves. For if God pronounces such dreadful threatenings against
   the unbelieving and irreligious Gentiles, who wandered in darkness, how
   much greater will be his rigour and severity against a rebellious
   people who have intentionally sinned against him!

   The servant who knoweth his master's will, and doeth it not, is justly
   beaten with many stripes. (Luke 12:47.)

   Thus when God threatened such dreadful punishment against the blind
   Gentiles, the Jews, who had been instructed in the law, might behold as
   in a mirror what they had deserved.

   But the chief design which Isaiah had in view in these predictions was,
   to point out to the Jews how dear and valuable their salvation was in
   the sight of God, when they saw that he undertook their cause and
   revenged the injuries which had been done to them. He spoke first of
   the desolation and ruin that would befall the kingdom of Judah and of
   Israel, because judgment must begin at the house of God. (1 Peter
   4:17.) God takes a peculiar care of his own people, and gives his chief
   attention to them. Whenever therefore we read these predictions, let us
   learn to apply them to our use. The Lord does not indeed, at the
   present day, foretell the precise nature of those events which shall
   befall kingdoms and nations; but yet the government of the world, which
   he undertook, is not abandoned by him. Whenever therefore we behold the
   destruction of cities, the calamities of nations, and the overturning
   of kingdoms, let us call those predictions to remembrance, that we may
   be humbled under God's chastisements, may learn to gather wisdom from
   the affliction of others, and may pray for an alleviation of our own
   grief.

   The burden. As to the word burden, which frequently occurs, I shall
   state briefly in what sense it ought to be understood. It was generally
   employed by the prophets of God, whenever they threatened any
   afflictive event, in order to inform the people that no afflictive
   event happened which the Lord himself did not lay as a burden on men's
   shoulders. The wickedness and obstinacy of the people having
   constrained the prophets to preach incessantly about God's
   chastisements, the consequence was, that as a matter of ordinary
   jesting they called all the prophecies by the name of a burden; as is
   evident from Jeremiah 23:36, where the Lord kindles into fierce
   indignation, because they not only spoke of his word contemptuously,
   but also held it up to dislike. This word makes known to the godly,
   that the Lord appoints all calamities and afflictions, that every one
   may suffer the punishment of his own sin.

   Which Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw. He expressly states that what he is
   about to utter was revealed to him by a heavenly vision, that the
   weight which is thus given to it may render it victorious over all the
   judgments pronounced by the flesh. It was difficult to believe that a
   monarchy so flourishing, and so prodigiously rich, could be overturned
   in any way. Their eyes being dazzled by beholding such vast power, the
   Prophet draws away their attention from it to believe the heavenly
   revelation, that they may expect by faith the judgment of God which
   they could not comprehend by the unaided exercise of their own minds.

   2. Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain. The word mountain
   contains a metaphor; for the discourse relates to Babylon, which, we
   know, was situated on a plain; but with a view to its extensive
   dominion, he has assigned to it an elevated situation, like a fortress
   set on high above all nations. But perhaps it will be thought better to
   take the word mountain as used indefinitely; as if he had said, "When a
   signal is given there will be a vast assemblage from very distant
   countries, because all men will be attracted towards it by the wide and
   extensive influence of the sight;" and, indeed, I consider this opinion
   to be more probable, but I chose to mention at first the opinion which
   had been commonly received. Yet it might be thought absurd that the
   Prophet here enjoins the creatures to yield, as it were, obedience to
   him, if God had not fortified the Prophet by his instructions and
   authority. A private man here commands the Medes and Persians,
   assembles armies, orders a banner to be lifted up, and sounds the
   trumpet for battle.

   This should therefore lead us to consider the majesty of God, in whose
   name he spoke, and likewise the power and efficacy which is always
   joined with the word. Such modes of expression are frequently found in
   the Prophets, that, by placing the events as it were before our eyes,
   he may enable us to see that God threatens nothing by his servants
   which he is not ready immediately to execute. Isaiah might indeed have
   threatened in plain and direct terms, "The Persians and Medes will
   come, and will burst through the gates of Babylon, notwithstanding the
   prodigious strength of its fortifications." But those exclamations are
   far more energetic, when he not only assumes the character of a herald
   and proclaims war, but, as if he exercised the highest authority,
   orders the Medes and Persians to assemble like hired soldiers. Not only
   does he show that they will be ready at the bidding of God, because
   they are moved by his secret influence; but, having been sent by God to
   announce the ruin of Babylon, he claims for his own voice the
   accomplishment of what appeared to be beyond belief. It amounts to
   this, "When God hath spoken about what shall happen, we ought to
   entertain no doubt concerning it." It deserves our notice also, that he
   describes the Persians and Medes, without mentioning their names; for
   that threatening is more emphatic, when he points them out, as it were,
   with the finger, as when we say, "This and that man." This contributes
   to the certainty of the prophecy, when he points out such distant
   events as if they were at hand.

   Shake the hand, that they may enter within the gates of the nobles.
   When he says, Shake the hand, and they shall enter, he means that the
   Persians and Medes shall no sooner begin to advance at the command of
   God than their road shall be plain and easy in spite of every
   obstruction. Though the Hebrews call Princes ndyvym, (Nedibim,) that
   is, generous and bountiful, on which is also founded that saying of
   Christ, euergetai kalountai, they are called benefactors, (Luke 22:25,)
   yet I think that the Prophet draws our attention to the splendor of
   power in which the Babylonians gloried. They were furnished above
   others with forces and warlike armaments, so that it appeared to be
   incredible that they could ever be vanquished. But the Prophet
   threatens that nothing shall hinder God from opening up a way and
   entrance to the enemies.

   3. I have commanded my sanctified ones. [198] Here the Prophet
   introduces the Lord as speaking and issuing his commands. He calls the
   Medes and Persians sanctified ones, that is, those whom he has
   prepared. The verb qds (kadash) is used in various senses; for
   sometimes it refers to the spirit of regeneration, and this belongs
   peculiarly to the elect of God. But sometimes it means to wish or
   prepare, and that meaning is more appropriate to this passage. All who
   are created by the Lord are likewise appointed by him for a fixed
   purpose. He does not throw down men at random on the earth, to go
   wherever they please, but guides all by his secret purpose, and
   regulates and controls the violent passions of the reprobate, so as to
   drive them in whatever manner he thinks fit, and to check and restrain
   them according to his pleasure. He therefore calls them sanctified
   ones, "set apart and prepared to execute his will," though they had no
   such intention. Hence also we are taught to ascribe to the secret
   judgment of God all violent commotions, and this yields wonderful
   consolation; for whatever attempts may be made by wicked men, yet they
   will accomplish nothing but what the Lord has decreed.

   I have also called my mighty ones. The phrase, I have called, conveys
   more than the phrase, I have commanded, which he had used in the former
   clause. It means that they will be roused to action, not only at the
   bidding of God, but by the very sound of his voice; as if I were to
   call a person to me, and he were immediately to follow. He threatens,
   therefore, that Babylon shall be destroyed by the Medes and Persians,
   in the same manner as if they obeyed the call of God; for though they
   were prompted to battle by their own ambition, pride, and cruelty, yet
   God directed them, without knowing it, to execute his judgment.

   4. The noise of a multitude in the mountains. He adds a still more
   lively representation, (hupotuposin,) that is, a description by which
   he places the event as it were before our eyes. The prophets are not
   satisfied with speaking, without also giving a bold picture of the
   events themselves. Words uttered plainly, and in the ordinary manner,
   do not strike us so powerfully or move our hearts so much as those
   figures which delineate a lively resemblance of the events. As if he
   had said, "Now, indeed, you hear a man speaking, but know that this
   voice will be so powerful that at the sound of it nations shall be
   roused, peoples shall make a noise, and in vast crowds shall shout and
   roar to bring destruction on the inhabitants of Babylon. This
   proclamation, therefore, will be as efficacious, even after that I am
   dead, as if you now saw what I foretell to you."

   In this event, therefore, we see how great is the efficacy of the word,
   which all the creatures both in heaven and in earth obey. We ought to
   be more strongly confirmed in the belief of this doctrine, by
   perceiving that every one of the events which had been predicted many
   centuries before has taken place. For this reason he declares that the
   Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle, that the various
   nations are moved by God's direction, and that, although nothing was
   farther from their intention than to inflict the punishment which he
   had appointed, still they do nothing but according to his command, as
   if some earthly general were to draw up his forces.

   5. Coming from a distant country. He repeats and confirms more fully
   what I stated a little before, that the operations of war do not spring
   up at random from the earth; for though everything disorderly is
   vomited out by the passions of men, yet God rules on high; and
   therefore Isaiah justly ascribes sovereignty to God. Next, he adds,
   that armed men are nothing else than the weapons of his indignation. He
   says that they will come from a distant country, to overturn the
   monarchy of Babylon, because we are not afraid of dangers unless when
   they are close at hand. Babylon was so strongly fortified, and was
   surrounded by so many kingdoms and provinces which were subject to it,
   that it seemed as if there were no way by which an enemy could
   approach. In short, as if she had been situated in the clouds, she
   dreaded no danger.

   From the end of heaven. There being no trouble all around that
   threatened them, he gives warning that the calamity will come from a
   distance. Though everything appears to be calm and peaceful, and though
   we are not at variance with our neighbors, God can bring enemies from
   the end of heaven. There is no reason, therefore, why we should promise
   to ourselves a lasting and prosperous condition, though we are not
   threatened with any immediate danger. If this prediction had reached
   the inhabitants of Babylon, they would undoubtedly have laughed at it
   as a fable. Even if we should suppose that they paid some respect to
   the Prophet, yet, having so strong a conviction of their safety, they
   would have despised those threatenings as idle and groundless. An
   example may be easily found. When we preach at the present day about
   the Turk, all think that it is a fable, because they think that he is
   still at a great distance from us. But we see how quickly he overtook
   those who were at a greater distance and more powerful. So great is the
   insensibility of men that they cannot be aroused, unless they are
   chastised and made to feel the blows. Let the inhabitants of Babylon,
   therefore, be a warning to us, to dread, before it is too late, the
   threatenings which the prophets utter, that the same thing may not
   happen to us as happens to those wicked men, who, relying on their
   prosperous condition, are so terrified when the hand of God attacks and
   strikes them, that they can no longer stand, but sink down bewildered.

   To destroy the whole land. When he puts the whole land for Babylon, he
   looks to the extent of the kingdom; that they may not think that the
   great number of provinces, by which they were surrounded on all sides,
   could ward off the attacks of enemies. But at the same time he
   intimates that it will be no slight calamity affecting a single spot,
   but will be like a deluge overwhelming a large portion of the world.

   Jehovah and the vessels of his anger. [199] The Persians and Medes are
   called vessels of anger in a different sense from that in which Paul
   gives that appellation to all the reprobate; for, by contrasting the
   vessels of wrath with the vessels of mercy, (Romans 9:22,23,) he shows
   that the undeserved goodness of God shines in the elect, but that the
   reprobate are monuments of severe judgment. But Isaiah means that the
   Medes and Persians may be regarded as darts in the hand of God, that by
   means of them he may execute his vengeance.

   6. Howl ye. He continues the same argument, and bids the inhabitants of
   Babylon howl. Not that he directs instruction to them, as if he hoped
   that it would be of any advantage, but, in foretelling what shall be
   their condition, he emphatically employs this form of direct address.

   For the day of the Lord is at hand. He calls it the day of the Lord,
   according to the usual custom of Scripture, because when the Lord
   delays his judgment, he appears to cease from the discharge of his
   office, like judges when they do not ascend the judgment-seat. This
   mode of expression deserves notice, for we would gladly subject God to
   our disposal, that he might immediately pass sentence against the
   wicked. But he has his own appointed time, and knows the seasons when
   it is proper both to punish the bad and to assist the good.

   It shall come as destruction from the Strong One. [200] He threatens
   that the severity of judgment will be such that the inhabitants of
   Babylon will have good reason not only to cry but to howl; because God
   displays his power to waste and destroy them. sdd (shadad) signifies to
   lay waste and plunder. From this verb is derived sdy, (Shaddai,) one of
   the names of God, which some render Almighty. There is therefore an
   elegant allusion to the derivation of the word; as if he had said, that
   the inhabitants of Babylon shall learn by their own destruction how
   appropriately God is called sdy, (Shaddai,) that is, strong and
   powerful to destroy. [201]

   7. Therefore all hands shall be weakened. He shows that the power of
   the Lord to destroy the inhabitants of Babylon will be so great, that
   they shall have no means of withstanding his anger. Though they stood
   high in wealth and in power, yet their hearts would be so faint, and
   their hands so weak, that they would have neither disposition nor
   ability to resist. And thus he indirectly ridicules the cruelty which
   boiled in the hearts of the Babylonians; for it is in the power of God
   to soften hearts, and to crush, loosen, or enfeeble hands or arms, so
   that suddenly all their courage shall fall down, and all their strength
   shall vanish away. When the heart quakes, what will be the use of
   fortifications, or armies, or wealth, or bulwarks? What avails a
   well-stocked workshop without a workman? We see this every day
   exemplified in those to whom in other respects the Lord had
   communicated large resources. Hence we see how vain is that confidence
   which we place in outward resources; for they would be of no use to us,
   if the Lord should strike our hearts with any alarm.

   8. Pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them. The word tsyrym (tzirim)
   being ambiguous, the Greek translators render it ambassadors. But the
   comparison of a woman that travaileth, which is added immediately
   afterwards, sufficiently proves that it denotes pangs; for here, as if
   by a single word, he explains what he had previously said, that their
   hearts shall be melted and their hands shall be weakened; because, he
   says, they shall be struck with terror and dismay. Whence comes this
   terror? From God. This kind of terror, for which there was no apparent
   cause, the ancients called a panic; [202] for they gave the name panes
   to apparitions and objects of this sort, by which men were terrified,
   even when there was no outward object that ought to have excited the
   terror. It was not without reason that they did so; but still they
   erred through gross ignorance, because they did not understand that it
   proceeded from God.

   As a woman that travaileth. So far as relates to the inhabitants of
   Babylon, there was, indeed, just ground of fear, when they saw that
   they were attacked by valiant and warlike nations; but yet the Prophet
   threatens that, though they were able to resist, still they would be
   like men who were half dead, because through the secret operation of
   God they fainted and fell down. To the same purpose is what he adds,
   Every one shall be amazed at his neighbor; as when men are agitated and
   stare around them in every direction; and not only so, but when no hope
   of safety is to be seen, they are like men who have lost their senses,
   and abandon themselves to indolence.

   Faces of flames their faces. [203] This clause, in which he attributes
   to them faces of flames, expresses still more strongly the violence of
   the terror. Some think that it denotes shame, as if he had said in a
   single word, They shall blush; but this is too feeble. Isaiah intended
   to express something greater and more dreadful; for when we are in
   agony the face glows, and the pressure of grief makes us burn. And,
   indeed, it would be treating the matter too lightly, when the calamity
   was so severe, to interpret these words as denoting shame; for he
   describes a calamity so distressing, that, on account of its severity,
   flames burst forth from the countenance, which usually happens when men
   are agonized by intense grief.

   The comparison of a travailing woman denotes not only the intensity of
   the grief, but likewise the suddenness with which it seized them. As
   the calamity would be severe and violent, so Isaiah threatens that it
   will be sudden, and not without good reason; for the inhabitants of
   Babylon, protected by such strong defences, would never have thought
   that it was possible for any annoyance to reach or distress them.

   9. Behold the day of the Lord will come cruel. He repeats what he had
   slightly noticed a little before, that though the inhabitants of
   Babylon are now at ease, and rely on their wealth, the day of the Lord
   is at hand, to terrify those who are at ease.

   But a question might here be raised, Why is the day of the Lord called
   cruel, since nothing is more desirable than to have God present with
   us; for his presence alone makes us truly happy? I answer, we ought
   always to consider who they are that are addressed by the Prophet; for
   it is customary with the prophets to give various descriptions of God
   corresponding to the diversity of the hearers. In like manner, David
   also declares that God is

   merciful to the merciful, and cruel and severe to the ungodly. (Psalm
   18:25,26.)

   What could wicked men imagine to be in God but the utmost severity? And
   therefore the slightest mention of God fills them with terror.

   The godly, on the other hand, whenever the name of God is mentioned,
   derive the greatest delight and joy from hearing it; so that nothing
   can be more highly gratifying. Thus, when the prophets address the
   godly, as soon as they have mentioned God, they speak of joy and
   gladness, because the godly will feel that he is gracious and merciful
   to them; but when they address the ungodly, they hold out the judgment
   of God, and speak of grief and mourning. As the godly are cheered by
   the presence of God, because by faith they behold his goodness; so the
   ungodly are terrified, because the testimony of their conscience
   reproves and convinces them that he comes as a severe Judge. Since even
   hypocrites pretend that they eagerly long for the day of the Lord, and
   boast that he will assist them, the prophets tear off from them this
   disguise, and show that to them the day of the Lord will be dreadful
   and alarming. (Amos 5:18,20.)

   Isaiah applies the usual description to this prophecy, in order to show
   more fully how much we ought to dread the wrath of God; for, being by
   nature slow, or rather stupid, we would not be powerfully affected if
   the Lord spoke in plain terms about his judgments. Since, therefore, an
   unadorned style would be too cold, he contrived new modes of
   expression, that by means of them he might shake off our sluggishness.
   When he says, and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it, he
   means by sinners not all men without distinction, but the ungodly and
   wicked men who inhabited Babylon.

   10. For the stars of heaven. In order to strike our minds with a
   stronger and more distressing fear of the judgment of God, the prophets
   are accustomed to add to their threatenings extravagant modes of
   speaking, which place the anger of God, as it were, before their eyes,
   and affect all our senses, as if all the elements were now arising to
   execute his vengeance. And yet the expressions, though unusually
   strong, do not go beyond the dreadful nature of what took place; for it
   is impossible to exhibit an image of the judgment of God so alarming
   that the reality shall not be felt to be more revolting and terrible.

   The sun, and the moon, and the stars are mentioned, because they are
   striking proofs of God's fatherly kindness towards us. Hence also
   Christ shows that it is an eminent proof of the goodness of God that

   he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good. (Matthew 5:45.)

   Accordingly, when the sun and moon and stars shine in heaven, God may
   be said to cheer us by his bright and gracious countenance. Since
   therefore in the brightness of heaven God shows a cheerful and friendly
   countenance, as if he might be said to smile upon us, the darkness
   which the Prophet describes conveys the thought, that God, by hiding
   his face, cast the men with whom he was angry into the darkness of
   sorrow.

   A similar description is given by the Prophet Joel.

   The sun shall be turned into darkness, the moon into blood, before it
   comes -- the day of Jehovah, great and terrible.
   (Joel 2:31.)

   We have already said that this mode of expression is frequently
   employed by the prophets, in order to inform us that everything will
   tend to our destruction, when God is against us. Sometimes indeed God
   gives tokens of his anger by means of the stars; but that is out of the
   usual course of events, and the darkness which the Prophet now
   describes will not take place till the second coming of Christ. But we
   ought to be satisfied with knowing that all the creatures, which by
   discharging their duties to us are proofs and instruments of God's
   fatherly kindness, not only cease to be useful to us, when God arises
   to judgment, but in some measure are armed for vengeance.

   11. And I will visit upon the world wickedness. Here the Prophet does
   not speak of the whole world; but as Babylon was the seat of the most
   powerful of all monarchies, he gives to it on that account the name of
   the world, and he does so emphatically, (emphatikos,) for Babylon was a
   kind of world, because it appeared to occupy nearly the whole earth.
   And yet he means that there is nothing in this world so lofty that God
   cannot easily seize it with one of his fingers. At the same time he
   gives warning that God will punish the cruelty which was exercised by
   the Chaldeans. Yet we ought also to learn that the wickedness and
   crimes of Babylon are brought forward, in order to inform us that the
   Lord will not be cruel in punishing her so severely, because he
   inflicts the punishment which that people deserved on account of their
   transgressions and crimes. Every ground of calumny is therefore taken
   away, that we may not think that God delights in the afflictions of
   men; for when he thus deals with men according as they deserve, the
   mouths of all must be stopped, (Romans 3:19,) since the severity of the
   afflictions does not proceed from God, but finds its cause in men
   themselves.

   And will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease. We must keep in
   mind what I have already noticed, that the Prophet yields no small
   consolation to the godly by assuring them that God, though he spares
   the inhabitants of Babylon for a time, will at length punish them for
   their injustice and cruelty. He expresses this still more clearly by
   taking notice of a particular vice, namely, pride, in consequence of
   which they loosed the reins, and gave unbounded freedom to their
   lawless desires to oppress the wretched. For this reason also he
   reproves their tyranny. But we ought also to draw from it a profitable
   doctrine, that it is impossible for us to escape punishment from the
   Lord, if we are puffed up with vain confidence and flatter ourselves.
   The Prophet here includes every kind of pride; whether men think that
   they are something, or admire their riches, and despise others in
   comparison of themselves. God cannot endure any arrogancy, or suffer it
   to pass unpunished. Seeing therefore, that among a great variety of
   other crimes with which Babylon abounded, this was the greatest and
   most remarkable, it was chiefly by their pride that the wrath of God
   was kindled.

   And will lay low the loftiness of tyrants. Arrogance was joined, as it
   usually is, to violence and cruelty; and therefore he adds the
   loftiness of tyrants; for when men despise others, this is followed by
   deeds of violence and injustice and oppression; and it is impossible
   for men to abstain from doing harm to others, if they do not lay aside
   all conceit and high estimation of themselves. Let us willingly,
   therefore, bring down our minds to true humility, if we do not wish to
   be cast down and laid low to our destruction.

   12. I will make a man more precious than pure gold. Here he describes
   in a particular manner how cruel and savage will be the war that is
   carried on against Babylon. In like manner believers, instructed by
   these predictions, implore in the spirit of prophecy what is the utmost
   exertion of the cruelty exercised in wars, that the Persians and Medes
   may tear the infants from their mothers' breasts, and dash them against
   the stones. (Psalm 137:9.) The general meaning is, that Babylon will
   not only be destroyed, but will be devoted to utter extermination; for
   when he says that the life of a man shall be more precious than gold,
   he asserts that the enemies will be so eager to shed blood, that it
   will be impossible to rescue a man out of their hands at any price,
   because they will choose rather to kill than to accept a ransom.

   It may be asked, Was this destruction as cruel as Isaiah here describes
   it to be? For history gives a different account, and Daniel himself,
   who was an eye-witness of this destruction, relates that the city was
   only taken, for the Medes and Persians spared the citizens and
   inhabitants. This argument has constrained some commentators to apply
   allegorically to all the reprobate what is here related of Babylon; but
   in doing so they have overstrained the passage, for shortly afterwards
   (verse. 17) the Prophet names the Medes and Persians. Besides, those
   threatenings which will afterwards follow in their proper order,
   against the Edomites, Moabites, the inhabitants of Tyre and of Egypt,
   and other nations, sufficiently show that the present discourse is
   directed literally against the Chaldeans, to whom the Prophet assigns
   the first rank; not that their destruction was as close at hand as that
   of other nations, but because none of the enemies of the Church were
   more dangerous.

   It ought to be observed that Isaiah did not utter this prediction while
   the monarchy of Nineveh was still flourishing; but all that he
   predicted against heathen nations, during the whole course of his
   ministry, was collected into one book. Thus the order of events was not
   observed, but a similarity of subject was the reason why all these
   prophecies were put into one place. How comes it that Isaiah takes no
   notice of Nineveh, since he afterwards mentions that the Assyrians
   alone attacked the Jews, (for the Babylonians lived at peace with
   them,) but because he does not relate the history of his own time till
   the twenty-third chapter, but prophesies about the judgments of God
   which happened after his death?

   Now, when he declares that Babylon will be utterly destroyed, it is
   certain that he does not merely describe a single calamity, but
   includes the destruction which followed long afterwards. After having
   been subdued by the Persians, Babylon continued to flourish, and held
   the name and rank of a very celebrated city. And although the city
   Ctesiphon was founded for the purpose of attracting a portion of its
   splendor and wealth, yet the convenience of its situation, the costly
   buildings, and the fortifications of the city, rendered it, with the
   exception of royal rank, not inferior to Persis. Even after the death
   of Alexander the Great, when Seleucia was built at no great distance,
   still it could not obliterate the name and reputation of the ancient
   city. Hence we conclude that those events which are here foretold
   cannot be limited to a single period.

   It is not without reason, however, that the Prophet pronounces such
   fearful threatening against them, since the revolution of the empire
   was the forerunner of the various calamities which followed afterwards.
   Though the people were not entirely slain, yet as the city was taken by
   storm, and by a sudden assault at the hour of midnight, while the whole
   court was carousing in drunken revels, it was impossible but that the
   Medes and Persians must have slain all that came in their way. There
   can be no doubt, therefore, that there was a great slaughter before the
   conquerors extended their protection to the whole of the people as
   having surrendered at discretion. Who can doubt that this haughty
   nation was roughly handled by barbarian conquerors, for in no other way
   could it have been reduced to obedience?

   Having been gradually weakened, not long afterwards, Babylon again
   changed its master, and, after having been governed for a short period
   by Alexander, king of Macedon, immediately passed under the dominion of
   Seleucus, who endeavored by every method to degrade it till it was
   completely ruined. Thus, so long as God permitted the city to remain in
   existence, it presented a shameful and revolting spectacle to the whole
   world, that the accomplishment of the prophecy might be more evident
   and more impressive. Hence the Prophet Isaiah has good reason for
   asserting that the anger of God will not be appeased till that den of
   robbers be utterly destroyed.

   A mortal and a man. So far as relates to the words, some translators
   render 'nvs (enosh) a warlike or eminent man, and 'dm (adam) an
   ordinary man. But as the etymology does not correspond to this view,
   and as I do not think that it occurred to the Prophet's mind, I
   consider it to be rather a repetition of the same sentiment, such as we
   know to have been customary among the Hebrews. The word phz, (paz,)
   which, in common with other translators, I have rendered pure gold, is
   supposed by some to mean a pearl; but from many passages of Scripture
   we conclude that it is the purest and finest gold

   13. Therefore I will shake the heavens. This is another figure of
   speech which contributes in a similar manner to heighten the picture.
   God cannot too earnestly urge this doctrine, not only to terrify the
   wicked, but to afford consolation to the godly, who are often
   distressed when it is well with the wicked, and when everything
   succeeds to their wish. David acknowledges that this happened to
   himself; for he says,

   Surely in vain have I purified my heart,
   and washed any hands in innocency. (Psalm 73:13.)

   Properly, therefore, are these pictures set before our eyes, that they
   may plainly declare to us the destruction of the wicked. Thus it is as
   if Isaiah had said, "Though heaven and earth be moved, that the ungodly
   may be shaken and destroyed, nevertheless this will take place." They
   think that they are out of all danger, and that they have struck their
   roots so deep that they cannot be rooted out; but he shows that they
   are greatly deceived, for the Lord will move both heaven and earth
   rather than not cast them down headlong. Hence it follows that, though
   the world present to us a thousand supports both above and below, still
   there will be no permanency but through the favor of God. And if this
   is made known in judgments of God relating to particular cases, how
   much more in the universal judgment, when Christ will ascend his
   magnificent judgment-seat, to destroy the ungodly!

   14. And it shall be as the chased roe. He shows that auxiliary troops
   will be of no avail to the Babylonians, and by these comparisons he
   describes the fear which shall seize the soldiers. Babylon employed not
   only her own soldiers, but likewise foreign and hired soldiers. He says
   that they will all be like roes, which are timorous creatures, and like
   scattered sheep, so that they will neither repair to their standards or
   their post, nor preserve any order.

   Every one to his own land. Hence it is easily seen that the Prophet
   speaks, not only of the natives, or even of the strangers who had
   formerly dwelt there, but of foreigners who had been brought for the
   protection of the city. We have formerly said that the hearts of men
   are in the hand of God in such a manner that, according to his
   pleasure, either those who formerly were timid or cowardly persons
   suddenly acquire fresh courage, or those who formerly boasted loudly of
   being bold and daring lose their fierceness and become effeminate.

   15. Every one that is found shall be thrust through. Here he confirms
   what he had formerly said, that none shall escape from Babylon, and
   that all who shall be there shall perish. Xenophon also relates that,
   by the command of Cyrus, they slew every one that they met in the
   beginning of the night, and next day all that had not laid down their
   arms. [204] But we have already said that the prediction extends
   farther; for that slaughter was only the forerunner of others, for
   which Babylon was purposely preserved, that it might frequently be
   ruined.

   And every one that is joined to them shall fall by the sword. Some
   translators render this clause differently from what I have done;
   because the Hebrew verb sphh (saphah) signifies to destroy or consume,
   they read it, Whosoever shall be destroyed, and explain it as relating
   to the old men, who were already worn out with age, and could not
   otherwise live longer; as if he had said, "Not even the men of advanced
   age, who are sinking into the grave, shall be spared, even though they
   are half-dead, and appear to be already giving up the ghost." But
   because that is a feeble interpretation, and the verb sphh (saphah)
   signifies likewise to add, I rather agree with Jonathan [205] and
   others, who think that it denotes companies of soldiers, as in taking a
   city the soldiers are collected together in the form of a wedge, to
   ward off the attacks of the enemy. But it will perhaps be thought
   better to understand by it the confederates or allies who were joined
   to Babylon, and might be said to be united in the same body, in order
   to show more fully the shocking nature of this calamity.

   16. Their children shall be dashed in pieces. He draws a picture of
   extreme cruelty. It is the utmost pitch of ferocity exercised by an
   invading army, when no age is spared, and infants, whose age makes it
   impossible for them to defend themselves, are slain. He represents it
   as still more shocking, when he adds, "in the sight of their parents."
   To the same purpose is what follows about plundering houses and
   ravishing wives; for these things happen when the enemies have
   forgotten all humanity, and are inflamed to cruelty, and wish that
   those whom they have subdued, and even their very name, should be
   rooted out.

   17. Behold I raise up against them the Medes. The Prophet, having
   predicted the destruction of the Babylonians, describes also the
   authors, or says that God will be the author; and at the same time he
   explains in what manner, and by means of whom, it will be accomplished;
   for he says that he will raise up the Medes. He certainly could not
   have conjectured this by human reason, for there were no jealousies and
   no quarrels between the Babylonians and the Medes; and if there had
   been any such, what power did the Medes at that time possess that they
   could do the Babylonians any harm? Seeing, therefore, that no
   preparations had been made for the Medes carrying on war against them,
   it is very certain that this was spoken by divine inspiration, and more
   especially since he foretold these events more than a hundred years
   before they took place.

   Who shall not think of silver, nor desire gold. [206] When he says that
   they shall not be covetous of silver and gold, he does not mean that
   the Medes were not guilty of plundering and covetousness, as if they
   were so generous that they despised gold and silver; but, on the
   contrary, he means that the battle will be cruel and bloody, that they
   will aim at nothing but a general slaughter. For example, the Spaniards
   of the present day, making it their chief object in war to plunder,
   more readily spare the life of men, and are not so bloodthirsty as the
   Germans or the English, who think of nothing but slaying the enemy.

   We ought not to think it strange that the Lord, though he is not cruel,
   yet makes use of agents who are so cruel, for he acts righteously even
   by the agency of wicked men, and is not stained with their wickedness.
   It would therefore be improper to form our judgment of the work of God
   from the executioners of it, for they are prompted either by ambition,
   or by covetousness, or by cruelty; but we ought to consider God's
   righteous punishment which the Babylonians deserved on account of their
   transgressions.

   18. And with bows they shall dash in pieces the children. [207] Some
   render it, they shall cut. They think that the language is exaggerated,
   as if they made use of the children of the Babylonians in place of
   arrows, and afterwards dashed them to the ground, that they might be
   broken with greater violence. But I choose rather to take a more simple
   view of the words, that the cruelty of the Medes will be so great, that
   they will not spare even infant children, on whom men do not commonly
   lay hands unless where there is the utmost barbarity; and, in short,
   that no allowance will be made for age, as we have formerly said.

   But we do not read that the Medes exercised so great cruelty, and
   Babylon stood and flourished for a very long period after that
   calamity; and although the seat of the empire was removed from it,
   still it retained its name and reputation. Besides, after the dawn of
   the following day, no cruelty was exercised but against those who bore
   arms. Though it was the Prophet's design to include other judgments of
   God which awaited the Babylonians, and by which the first calamity was
   followed long afterwards, yet it is not improperly or unseasonably that
   he describes the barbarous manners of the nation, that the Jews may be
   more fully aware that a just reward is prepared for the tyranny of
   Babylon. Nor can it be doubted that it was in reliance on this promise
   that believers afterwards presented that prayer;

   Blessed is he who shall dash thy little ones against the stones.
   (Psalm 137:9.)

   19. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms. Here the Prophet intended to
   give a brief summary of his prophecy about the Babylonians, but
   enlarges it by some additions tending to show more fully that it will
   be completely destroyed. In this manner do the prophets speak of the
   punishment of the wicked, so as to leave no room for compassion by
   which they may relieve their minds. But the godly, though they may
   sometimes think that they are severely chastised, are yet supported by
   the confident hope that the Lord will have compassion on them, and will
   not altogether destroy them. Hence we may conclude that we ought not
   always to judge from outward appearances; for we would often think that
   the children of God are ruined when their salvation is at hand even in
   the midst of death.

   Of Sodom and Gomorrah. This example is frequently employed by the
   Prophets, in order to inform us that, though the mode of punishment be
   not the same, yet, since the judgment of God is impartial, that
   memorable display which he gave in Sodom (Genesis 19:24) has a
   reference to all the reprobate, and that not less dreadful punishment
   awaits those who are hardened by similar obstinacy in their sins. They
   distinguish between the punishment of the elect people and the
   punishment of the wicked by this circumstance, that God reserves some
   seed for the Israelites, but none for the ungodly, which agrees with
   the words which we formerly met with,

   Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed,
   we should have been like Sodom. (Isaiah 1:9.)

   But he pursues the wicked with vengeance that cannot be appeased, and
   therefore he threatens against them the same destruction which was
   executed against the inhabitants of Sodom, that is, utter perdition
   without any hope of escape.

   Shall be like God's overthrowing. [208] He says that it is God's
   overthrowing, that we may not think that it happens by chance, or that
   it has proceeded from the will of men. As it was not at random that the
   thunderbolt fell from heaven on Sodom, so it was not at random that
   Babylon fell down, but by the righteous vengeance of God, who, being
   always like himself, executed righteous judgment on them; and in like
   manner will execute the same judgment on all the reprobate till the
   end.

   When Babylon is called the glory of kingdoms and splendid brightness,
   this is added for the sake of amplification, (pros auxesin,) in order
   to inform us, that no glory or splendor can hinder God from bringing
   the wicked to nought; for that overturn, having been incredible,
   afforded a more remarkable proof of Divine power.

   20. It shall never be inhabited any more. By the verb tsv, (thesheb,)
   shall sit, he means continuance; as if he had said, "There is no hope
   of restoring Babylon." All these forms of expression have precisely the
   same object, that the Babylonians will be destroyed with such a
   destruction that their ruin shall be perpetual. The picture is still
   further heightened by adding, that the desolation will be so great that
   in that place neither will the Arabians pitch their tents, nor the
   shepherds their folds That place must have been marvellously forsaken
   and uncultivated, when it was disregarded by those roving tribes; for
   the Arabians were a wandering and unsettled nation, and had no fixed
   abode. Having left their native country, because it was barren, and is
   therefore called Arabia Deserta, (for it is of that country that we
   speak,) they devoted themselves to feeding flocks and to hunting, and
   wandered without any fixed residence; for which reason also the Greeks
   called them skenetai, (skenetai,) dwellers in tents. Now the country
   around Babylon was exceedingly fertile before that calamity, which
   rendered this change the more astonishing and almost miraculous, either
   because the place lost its former fertility, or because the constant
   slaughter made all men abhor the sight of it. Undoubtedly the Prophet
   means that not only will the buildings be thrown down, but the very
   soil will be accursed.

   21. But the Ziim shall lie there. [209] He continues the description of
   a desert place, and alludes to what he had formerly said, that Babylon
   will be destitute of inhabitants. In what way tsyym (tziim) ought to be
   translated I cannot easily say, on account of the diversity in the
   opinions of translators, who differ in this, as in various names of
   animals and herbs. The use of these things did not continue among them;
   and the Jews, who are themselves ignorant and unskilful, do not retain
   the knowledge of these things, though there are some of them who know
   nothing about either herbs or animals, and yet have the impudence to
   boast of being physicians. Of those who think that tsyym (tziim) is the
   name of a wild animal, some will have it to be a quadruped, and others,
   a bird; but that is a matter of little importance. For my own part, I
   have no doubt that the Prophet means either wild beasts which cannot be
   tamed, or birds which build their nests in distant forests.

   It will not be amiss to explain what follows about Satyrs or Pans, who
   are called by the French, according to the various dialects of the
   provinces, sometimes Luittons, sometimes Follets, and sometimes
   Loups-garouz [210] As Satan deludes men by various tricks, so he gives
   to them various names. It is certain that tsyym (tziim) is often used
   in Scripture for devils; and it is derived from tsyh, (tziyah,) which
   means dryness, or, a desert, as 'yym (iyim) is derived from 'ym,
   (ayam,) which means to terrify. The Devil performs strange tricks by
   means of Fauns and Satyrs, and on that account their names are given to
   him.

   The design of the Prophet is to show that the solitude will be so
   great, that not only will the place be deserted by men, but even the
   devils will there deceive by their tricks; for the devils avail
   themselves of the tendency of solitary places to produce terror. As
   enemies and robbers, by sallying forth from concealed lurking-places,
   frighten men the more, so devils take advantage of the night and the
   darkness, and of places distant from the view of men, that they may be
   able to excite greater terror in those who are naturally timorous.

   22. And Iim shall cry [211] He expresses the same thing as had been
   formerly said, and shows how dreadful that change will be, in order to
   make it manifest that it proceeds from the judgment of God, and not
   from chance. The picture is even heightened by adding that this will
   take place, not in ordinary buildings, but in delightful palaces [212]
   While the shortness of time which is here laid down refers to the
   approaching calamity, it was at the same time necessary that the hope
   of believers should be held longer in suspense. I have said that
   Babylon was not so speedily overturned, and that the Medes did not
   inflict such a calamity upon it that it could be compared to a desert.
   He therefore said that it would quickly happen, because the beginnings
   of it were soon afterwards seen; for the Jews ought to have been
   satisfied with knowing that the punishment had not been threatened
   without good grounds.

   And her time is near. The Holy Spirit also keeps in view our ardor and
   rashness. We would choose that God should immediately execute his
   judgments, and punish wicked men whenever we wish. But God knows what
   is the proper time, for which our eagerness does not allow us to wait.
   Yet if we would take into consideration his eternity, we should quickly
   find that by patience we laid the bridle on excessive haste; but as our
   eagerness can hardly be restrained in any other manner, God sometimes
   deals with us gently to some extent, by declaring that He will soon
   come. Again, let us not judge of the shortness of time according to our
   own views, but, disregarding the days of this life, let us raise our
   hearts to heaven. Especially let us learn to bow, whenever we are made
   to feel, even in a small degree, the judgments of God, though he delay
   their full accomplishment for a longer period.

   And her days shall not be prolonged. This second clause is added for
   confirmation; as if he had said that the Lord hath appointed a day, and
   that none shall be admitted to obtain a truce.

   Isaiah Chapter 14:1-32

   1. For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel,
   and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with
   them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.

   1. Jam miserebitur Iehova Iacob, et eliget adhuc Israelem, et faciet
   eos quiescere super terram suam; adjungeturque illis advena;
   sociabuntur, inquam, domui Iacob.

   2. And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place; and
   the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for
   servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose
   captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

   2. Et assument eos populi, inducentque eos in locum suum, possidebitque
   eos domus Israel in terra Iehovae, in servos et ancillas; et capient
   eos quorum fuerant captivi, imperabuntque oppressoribus suis.

   3. And it shall come to pass, in the day that the Lord shall give thee
   rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage
   wherein thou wast made to serve,

   3. Et erit in die quo tibi requiem dederit Iehova a labore tuo, et a
   tremore tuo, et a servitudine dura quae imposita fuerat tibi:

   4. That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon,
   and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! The golden city ceased!

   4. Tunc sumes dictum hoc super Regem Babylonis, et dices: Quomodo
   cessavit exactor? Cessavit cupida auri?

   5. The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the
   rulers.

   5. Confregit Iehova baculum impiorum, sceptrum dominantium.

   6. He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that
   ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.

   6. Quod percutiebat populos in ira plaga perpetua; dominabatur in
   iracundia Gentibus; si quis persequutionem patiebatur, non prohibuit.

   7. The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into
   singing.

   7. Quievit, tranquilla est omnis terra, cecinerant laudem.

   8. Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
   saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.

   8. Etiam abietes laetatae sunt super te, cedri Libani; ex quo quievisti
   non ascendit succisor contra nos.

   9. Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it
   stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth: it
   hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

   9. Infernus subtus commotus est propter te, in occursum adventus tui
   excitavit tibi mortuos, et omnes duces terrae suscitavit de soliis
   suis, omnes Reges gentium.

   10. All they shall speak and say untothee, Art thou also become weak as
   we? Art thou become like unto us?

   10. Omnes loquentur, et dicent tibi: Tu quoque infirmitate affectus es
   sicut nos? et similis factus es nobis?

   11. Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols:
   the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

   11. Deposita est in sepulchrum magnificentia tua, et strepitus
   musicorum instrumentorum tuorum; subter te stratus est vermis, et
   operiunt te vermiculi.

   12. How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how
   art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!

   12. Quomodo cecidisti e coelo Lucifer fili Aurorae? Quomodo in terram
   detractus es, sortem projiciens super Gentes (vel, debilitans gentes)?

   13. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I
   will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the
   mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

   13. Atqui tu dicebas in corde tuo, Ascendam in coelum: in supernis
   juxta sidera Dei collocabo solium meum, et sedebo in monte testimonii,
   in lateribus Aquilonis.

   14. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the
   most High.

   14. Ascendam super excelsa nubium, et ero similis Altissimo.

   15. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.

   15. Tu vero in sepulchrum detractus es, ad latera foveae.

   16. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider
   thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did
   shake kingdoms;

   16. Videntes te inclinabunt se, et attente intuebuntur. Anne hic est
   vir ille tremefaciens terram, concutiens regna?

   17. That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
   thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

   17. Posuit orbem quasi desertum, urbes ejus excidit, vinctis suis non
   aperuit domum.

   18. All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every
   one in his own house:

   18. Omnes Reges gentium, ipsi, inquam, omnes jacent cum gloria; quisque
   domi suae.

   19. But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and
   as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword,
   that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.

   19. Tu autem projectus es e sepulchro tuo, tanquam surculus
   detestandus, tanquam vestes interfectorum, qui gladio caesi sunt,
   descendentes in foveam; ut cadaver proculcatum.

   20. Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast
   destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evil doers shall
   never be renowned.

   20. Non conjunges te cum eis in sepultura; quoniam terram tuam
   vastasti, populum tuum occidisti, non memorabitur perpetuo semen
   impiorum.

   21. Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
   fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face
   of the world with cities.

   21. Praeparate filiis ejus mactationem, in iniquitate patrum suorum; ne
   consurgant et possideant terram, atque impleant superficiem orbis
   urbibus.

   22. For I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut
   off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the
   Lord.

   22. Nam consurgam super eos dicit Iehova exercituum, et exterminabo e
   Babylone nomen et reliquias, filium et nepotem, dicit Iehova.

   23. I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
   water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the
   Lord of hosts.

   23. Et ponam eam in possessionem erinacei, et in stagna aquarum, et
   scopabo eam scopa evacuans, dicit Iehova exercituum.

   24. The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so
   shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand;

   24. Juravit Iehova exercituum, dicendo: Si non quemadmodum cogitavi,
   sic factum est; et quemadmodum consultavi, ita stabit;

   25. That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains
   tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his
   burden depart from off their shoulders.

   25. Ut conteram Assur in terra mea, et in montibus meis conculcem eum;
   et recedat ab eis jugum illius, et onus illius ab humero ejus
   auferatur.

   26. This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this
   is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

   26. Hoc consilium quod consultatum est super totam terram; et haec
   manus extenta super omnes gentes.

   27. For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? And
   his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

   27. Quoniam Iehova exercituum decrevit, et quis dissolvet? Manus ejus
   extenta, et quis avertet eam?

   28. In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

   28. Anno quo mortuus est Rex Achaz, fuit hoc onus.

   29. Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
   smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a
   cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.

   29. Ne laeteris universa tu Philistaea; quoniam confracta sit virga
   percutientis te. Nam de radice colubri nascetur regulus, et fructus
   ejus serpens ignitus.

   30. And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie
   down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay
   thy remnant.

   30. Et pascentur primogeniti pauperum, et inopes secure accubabunt; et
   fame interire faciam radicem tuam, et reliquias tuas occidet.

   31. Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved:
   for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in
   his appointed times.

   31. Ulula porta, clama civitas, liquefacta es Palestina, universa tu.
   Quoniam ab Aquilone venit fumus; nec quisquam solus praefixo ejus die.

   32. What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the
   Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.

   32. Quid autem respondebitur nuntiis gentis? Nempe quod Iehova fundavit
   Sion, et in ea fiduciam habebunt pauperes populi ejus.


   1. For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob. The particle ky(ki)
   having various significations, we might take it as signifying But, and
   might connect this verse with the former verse in the following manner:
   But (or, yet) the Lord will have compassion on Jacob. But I consider it
   to be better and more appropriate to view the particle ky (ki), in this
   as well as in many other passages, as used for assigning a reason; and
   thus the meaning will be, "God will destroy Babylon, because he will
   have compassion on Israel, whom he cannot despise or reject." Hence we
   see that the Prophet had hitherto endeavored to soothe the grief of a
   wretched people, in order to inform them that they ought to entertain
   good hopes in the midst of their afflictions, of which God would be the
   avenger. (Psalm 94:1.) Here, therefore, as in a picture, Babylon is
   contrasted with the Church of God; Babylon, I say, elevated to the
   highest power, which had plunged the Church into such a miserable and
   afflicted condition, that it was not probable that she could ever be
   raised up again. But the Lord casts down Babylon from her lofty
   situation, and thus testifies that he cares for his people, however
   mean and despicable they may be. It yields very great consolation to us
   to learn that the whole world is governed by God for our salvation. All
   things are directed to this object, that those whom he has elected may
   be saved, and may not be overwhelmed by any changes, however numerous,
   that shall befall them.

   It will be asked, Was there a period during which God had no
   compassion? Undoubtedly, he always had compassion; but while the people
   were distressed by heavy calamities, it was not perceived; for, having
   their minds previously occupied with a view of God's anger, and,
   judging from outward appearances, they could not perceive God's
   compassion. Yet the Lord was always like himself, and never laid aside
   his nature. Thus it is proper to distinguish between the knowledge
   which springs from faith and the knowledge which springs from
   experience; for when the tokens of God's anger are visible all around,
   and when the judgment of the flesh leads us to believe that he is
   angry, his favor is concealed from us; but faith raises our hearts
   above this darkness, to behold God in heaven as reconciled towards us.
   What follows is somewhat more startling.

   And will yet choose Israel, or, will again choose Israel. God's
   election is eternal. He does not choose us as if this had never before
   come into his mind; and as we were chosen before the foundation of the
   world, (Ephesians 1:4,) so he never repents of his choice. (Romans
   11:29.) But when the Lord chastises his people, this has the appearance
   of rejecting them; as we learn from the frequent complaints of the
   saints, Lord, why hast thou cast us off? (Psalm 74:1.) We look at God's
   rejection or election according to our weakness, and judge of his
   feelings toward us by the outward action. (I speak of the knowledge
   which is derived from experience, and which is corrected by the light
   of faith.) Accordingly, when the Lord calls us, that is, confirms his
   election, he is said to choose us; and when he gives evidence that he
   is displeased, he is said to reject us. The meaning, therefore, is,
   "Though the Lord has treated his people so severely, as if he had
   rejected them; yet by the actual event he will at length show and prove
   that he has adopted them, by giving abundant evidence of his election,
   and by having compassion on them for ever."

   We now may readily conclude what we have already said, namely, that the
   chastisements which the godly endure are widely different from that
   deadly stroke, however light it may be, which is inflicted on the
   ungodly. The godly are immediately led to consider their election, the
   confident belief of which cheers their hearts; but the ungodly see
   nothing but darkness, bottomless pits, and frightful desolation on all
   sides. Whenever, therefore, the Lord chastises us, we ought immediately
   to call to remembrance this distinction, that we may strengthen our
   hearts by the hope of a happier condition.

   And shall cause them to rest in their own land. In their return he
   holds out an evidence of favor and reconciliation; for to the children
   of Abraham the land of Canaan was a pledge of their adoption.

   And the stranger shall be joined to them. The Prophet foretells the
   calling of the Gentiles; as if he had said, "Not only will the Lord
   restore them to the possession of the land of Canaan, but will enlarge
   them by a great increase; for he will associate the Gentiles with them,
   that the two peoples may become one and the same body." This benefit,
   therefore, is not limited to a short period, but extends to the whole
   Church, which the Lord promises to place in safety; for he speaks, not
   of the Church in his own time, but of the Church which shall be till
   the kingdom of Christ, and during his kingdom; otherwise that addition
   would have been inappropriate.

   2. And the peoples shall take them. He means that the foreign nations
   will be willing to become their companions, and in such a manner that
   they will not scruple to discharge the duties of servants. An instance
   of this was given, (Ezra 1:6,) when the people were brought back from
   Babylon; but that was only a slight foretaste of those things which
   were accomplished by Christ, to whom all these statements must be
   referred. The Lord softened the hearts of the nations, who regarded
   that people with deadly hatred, so that by their guidance he brought
   them back to their native country, and bestowed on them their former
   liberty. But so far were many of the nations from assisting the Jews,
   after their return from Babylon, that all the neighbors earnestly
   entered into a league to distress them. (Ezra 4:4.) They certainly
   attempted not only to banish them from the land of Canaan, but to drive
   them entirely out of the world. These things therefore were done in the
   kingdom of Christ, to whom

   has been given all power, not only in earth, but also in heaven,
   (Matthew 28:18,)

   and by whom the Gentiles, who formerly had been strangers, were united
   to the Jews, so as not only to assist them in keeping their
   inheritance, but also to submit calmly and willingly to bear the yoke.
   It is with this view that he adds --

   And the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for
   servants and handmaids. The Jews being in some sort the first-born
   (Exodus 4:22) in the house of God, we who are joined to them appear as
   if we had assembled under their roof; for they go before us, and hold
   the highest rank above all the nations, and undoubtedly would still
   hold it, if they did not by their ingratitude deprive themselves of
   these great privileges. And yet their ingratitude did not hinder the
   Lord from actually performing these things; for the Apostles, being
   Jews, subdued foreign nations by the word of God, and even those very
   nations by whom they were formerly carried captive, and to whom they
   had been tributaries, such as the Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Persians,
   and finally, the Roman empire; so that all the nations might justly be
   called their inheritance, though they did not wish to rule over them,
   but to gain them to God, that they might acknowledge the same Lord and
   Prince as themselves. These statements must therefore be referred to
   the dominion and yoke of Christ, to whom the Jews subdued the Gentiles,
   not to a government of an outward nature, such as the Jews falsely
   imagine.

   3. And it shall be in that day. He adds a confirmation of the former
   promises. In this way the Lord provides for our weakness; for we find
   it difficult to render a full belief to his word, especially when the
   state of our affairs appears to contradict it. But by this method the
   Lord chooses to put our faith to the test, when he still promises the
   salvation of which all hope has been taken away.

   From thy sorrow, and from thy trembling, and from thy hard bondage. He
   confirms what he has said by a variety of expressions, that, by
   removing all doubt, we may not cease to rely on his promises, even when
   our affairs are desperate. Yet by the same considerations he at the
   same time exhorts the Jews to gratitude, that they may never bury in
   forgetfulness a work of God so excellent and so worthy of remembrance.
   He expressly intended to mention the yoke and bondage, that the Jews
   might be fully aware that the Lord would take away these obstructions
   whenever he pleased, and that they could not at all prevent him from
   immediately delivering his people, when he thought fit. We ought also
   to apply this to our own use, in the present day, with reference to the
   wretched bondage and wicked yoke of Antichrist by which Christians are
   bound. Though they are confined and bound by snares and chains in every
   direction, they have God for their deliverer, who will quickly remove
   all difficulties and every kind of annoyances; and this ought to be
   extended to all sorrows, distresses, and afflictions.

   4. Then thou shalt take up this saying. [213] By the term witty saying,
   or parable, (for the Hebrew word msl (mashal) denotes "sayings that are
   weighty and remarkable, and worthy of being observed,") he shows that
   the ruin of Babylon will be so great that it will even become a
   proverb, which usually happens in great and astonishing events.

   How hath the oppressor ceased? The word How throws it into the form of
   a question expressive of astonishment and ridicule. It might be thought
   incredible that Babylon, furnished with such abundant wealth and
   forces, should be overturned and fall into the hands of the enemy.
   Justly, therefore, does he ridicule their foolish and vain confidence,
   that, being swelled with haughtiness, they thought that they were
   invincible, and were placed beyond the reach of all danger.

   Yet it may be thought to be inconsistent with the modesty of godly
   persons to scoff at the misery of others, for they ought rather to have
   pitied them. But it is not inconsistent with compassion, when our zeal
   is regulated by the justice of the judgment of God; for in that case we
   may with human feelings compassionate those who perish through their
   folly, and at the same time laugh at their insolence and madness. As
   the Lord scoffs at them, laughing at their senselessness, so he bids
   us, through zeal for his glory, mock at them; not that we may be
   swelled with impudence, but that we may praise his goodness and power.
   By this example, therefore, we may scoff at the enemies of God, when
   they are vanquished or brought down, as we may scoff at Antichrist,
   whose power we daily see diminished and gradually falling into decay.

   How hath the city covetous of gold ceased! [214] The word mdhvh,
   (madhebah,) in this clause, might be rendered golden, or ornamented
   with gold; but as it is connected with the word Oppressor or Tyrant, it
   probably denotes covetousness and insatiable greediness for gold, to
   which the Babylonians were subject. It is usually the case with great
   empires and states and wealthy nations, that the greater their
   abundance, the stronger is their greediness to possess more. [215]

   5. The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked. He answers the
   question which has just been put; for he did not intend that believers
   should doubt that it would happen, but rather that they should be
   amazed at such wonderful works of God; for the question had a tendency
   to arouse their minds to more earnest attention. It is as if he had
   said that it did not happen at random or through the blind violence of
   fortune that they have not been oppressed by continual bondage, but
   that it ought to be ascribed to the providence of God, who hath broken
   that hard yoke of bondage. Now, the ungodly are amazed at such works,
   and remain bewildered, because they do not see the reason; but the
   godly know that this ought to be ascribed to God. Let us therefore
   learn to admire the works of God, and while we are amazed at them, let
   us acknowledge him to be the Author; and let us not think that any of
   them ought to be lightly passed over, especially when he displays his
   power for redeeming his Church, when by his wonderful power he delivers
   each of us from the bondage of the devil, from the tyranny of
   Antichrist, from eternal death. It is no ordinary work, of which any
   part ought to be ascribed to the power of man or to any other cause.

   To the staff of the wicked he adds the sceptre of the rulers; and by
   this repetition he means that no imperial power can support unjust
   tyranny. And immediately afterwards he states more clearly that the
   monarchy of the Babylonians would be destroyed, because it was unjust
   and tyrannical, when he says (Isaiah 14:6) that the people had been
   struck with an incurable stroke, [216] and that there was no limit to
   the violence, because they had rioted with impunity in unbounded
   licentiousness. This reminds us that at length God will not spare
   tyrants, though he may wink at them for a time. The same destruction
   awaits them as, we learn, befell Babylon; for the Lord is righteous,
   (Psalm 11:7,) and is always like himself.

   7. and 8. They break forth into singing. Here he shows how greatly
   tyrants are hated by the whole world. When they are dead or ruined, all
   men break forth into joy, and express the feelings which they formerly
   entertained towards the tyrants, and which they dissembled through
   fear. Then do their hatred and spite burst forth, and not only do men
   make known their joy, but even the dumb creatures, as the Prophet, for
   the sake of amplification, adds the fir-trees and the cedars. As
   tyranny overturns everything, so when tyranny is done away, everything
   appears to be restored to its original condition.

   Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us. To make the
   discourse more energetic, he adds a personification, in which he
   introduces the trees as speaking and congratulating themselves that,
   since the tyrant is dead, they will now stand gladly and at ease. The
   design of the Prophet is to show, that the Heavenly Judge cannot endure
   tyrants, who are abhorred by the whole world. Hence, we ought to
   conclude that, though under the sway of tyrants unhappy men are silent,
   and do not venture to open their mouths, yet the Lord listens to their
   secret groans. Let us not wonder therefore that tyrants come to such a
   dismal end; for God, who is a witness of the injuries which they have
   inflicted, must in the exercise of his justice assist the innocent.

   9. Hell from beneath is moved for thee. [217] As he had formerly
   attributed gladness to the trees, so now, by a similar figure, he
   attributes speech to the dead [218] He arouses them, as it were, from
   their graves, to mock at the pride of this tyrant. The whole passage is
   ironical, and full of keen sarcasm. At the approach of kings, the
   people tremble, and come forth to meet and receive them with pompous
   display. The Prophet makes a fictitious representation, that when this
   tyrant shall die and go down to the grave, the dead will go forth to
   meet and honor him, but with such honor as he deserves. As if he had
   said, "Not only the living, but also the dead will rejoice at his
   death. The dead also will treat him respectfully according to his
   deserts."

   10. All shall speak and say to thee. These are taunts with which the
   dead jeer the tyrant who has joined them, as if they asked him what is
   the reason why he too is dead like other men. Struck with the
   singularity of the event, Isaiah pretends that they inquire with
   astonishment about it as something that could not be believed.

   Art thou become like unto us? Tyrants are blinded by their greatness,
   and do not think that they are mortal, and even make themselves to be
   half-gods and adore themselves. On this account it is made known after
   their death that they shared in the condition of all mortals, to which
   they did not think that they were liable. It is in this sense that the
   dead, not without bitter scorn, reproach him for having become like
   unto themselves; for "death alone," as the poet says, "acknowledges how
   small are the dimensions of the bodies of men." [219] David also,
   speaking of princes and their high rank, says,

   I have said, ye are gods; but you shall die like men, and fall like one
   of the common people. (Psalm 82:6, 7.)

   The bodies of princes, like those of the common people, must at length
   become corrupted and be devoured by worms, even though costly and
   splendid sepulchres be built for them.

   11. Thy pomp is laid down in the grave. He mentions royal pomp, that
   this change may be more attentively considered by comparing the latter
   with the former; and he shows that that pomp could not prevent him from
   being reduced to the same level with other men. Under the term musical
   instruments, he includes all the luxuries and enjoyments in which kings
   are wont to indulge; because not only does the sweetness of music cause
   them to forget death, but the mad sound of them drives away all
   sadness, and in some respects stupifies the minds of men.

   The worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. In this second
   clause, the dead say jestingly, "Thou hast obtained a bed worthy of
   thee; for the worms serve thee for tapestry or a soft couch, and the
   worm serves for a splendid coverlet." In a word, there is here
   exhibited to us a lively painting of the foolish confidence of men,
   who, intoxicated with their present enjoyments and prosperity, flatter
   themselves. This doctrine ought to be carefully pondered; for though
   men be well aware of their condition, and have death before their eyes,
   yet overrun by ambition, and soothed by pleasures, and even fascinated
   by empty show, they forget themselves.

   12. How art thou fallen from heaven! Isaiah proceeds with the discourse
   which he had formerly begun as personating the dead, and concludes that
   the tyrant differs in no respect from other men, though his object was
   to lead men to believe that he was some god. He employs an elegant
   metaphor, by comparing him to Lucifer, and calls him the Son of the
   Dawn; [220] and that on account of his splendor and brightness with
   which he shone above others. The exposition of this passage, which some
   have given, as if it referred to Satan, has arisen from ignorance; for
   the context plainly shows that these statements must be understood in
   reference to the king of the Babylonians. But when passages of
   Scripture are taken up at random, and no attention is paid to the
   context, we need not wonder that mistakes of this kind frequently
   arise. Yet it was an instance of very gross ignorance, to imagine that
   Lucifer was the king of devils, and that the Prophet gave him this
   name. But as these inventions have no probability whatever, let us pass
   by them as useless fables.

   Casting the lot upon the nations, or weakening the nations. [221]
   Translators have mistaken the meaning of this clause, by rendering the
   participle hvls (holesh) passively, Thou art become weak, for its
   signification is active. But as the verb from which it is derived
   signifies to cast a lot, and as the preposition l, (gnal,) upon, is
   here added, it is best to take it in this meaning, that, as the ruler
   and disposer of all countries, he directed them by lot, or held them as
   his own possessions. And yet I do not reject the other meaning, that he
   weakened the nations

   13. Yet thou saidst in thy heart. These words must be connected with
   what goes before. To say means here, according to the custom of the
   Hebrew language, to resolve in one's own mind. The Prophet ridicules
   the pride of the Babylonian monarch, who, relying on his greatness,
   ventured to promise to himself uninterrupted success, as if he had the
   power of determining the events of his life. In him there is exhibited
   to us a mirror of the madness of pride with which ungodly men are
   swelled, and which sometimes they even vomit out. Nor ought we only to
   behold here the person of a single tyrant, but the blasphemous rage of
   all the ungodly, who form their resolutions as if they could dispose of
   everything according to their pleasure; as their plans are also
   beautifully described by James,

   We shall go into that city, we shall transact business, we shall make
   gain, though at the same time they know not what to-morrow shall bring.
   (James 4:13.)

   They do not consider that they are in the hands of God, but believe
   that they will do everything by their own ability.

   I will ascend into heaven. In these words, and those which immediately
   follow, the boasting is so absurd that it is impossible to believe that
   they proceeded from the lips of a mortal man; but as the Prophet did
   not intend to quote the very words which Nebuchadnezzar employed, let
   us be satisfied with examining the subject itself. Undoubtedly, all who
   claim for themselves more than human nature will allow, may be said to
   "attack heaven itself after the manner of the giants," as the proverb
   runs. [222] Hence it follows that whatever they undertake will be
   destructive to them; more especially every one who goes beyond the
   limits of his calling provokes the wrath of God against himself by his
   rashness. Let every one therefore be satisfied with his lot, and learn
   not to aim at anything higher, but, on the contrary, to remain in his
   own rank in which God has placed him. If God stretch out his hand, and
   lift us up higher, we ought to go forward; but no one ought to take it
   on himself, or to strive for it from his own choice. And even those who
   are raised to a higher rank of honor ought to conduct themselves humbly
   and submissively, not with any pretended modesty, but with minds so
   thoroughly depressed that nothing can lift them up.

   I will sit on the mountain of the testimony, [223] on the sides of the
   north. This plainly shows the reason why the Prophet especially accuses
   the Babylonian tyrant of so great madness, and what the Prophet means
   by such figures. He desired to sit on the mountain of the testimony. By
   this effrontery he attempted to make himself equal to God. Though he
   reasoned, after the manner of men, that he could obtain a victory over
   the Jews, yet, reckoning as nothing the assistance of God, by whom he
   had often heard that they were protected, it was as if he had
   endeavored to destroy the very heavens. For Mount Zion he uses the
   expression the sides of the north, according to the description,

   Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, [224]
   the city of the great King. (Psalm 48:2.)

   He had formerly called it the mountain of the testimony. This word is
   derived from yd, (yagnad;), which signifies to unite, to assemble, and
   to be agreed. On this account mvd (mogned) signifies both an assembly
   and an appointed day; and, in a word, it may relate to time, place, and
   persons. But here I prefer to view it as a Covenant; for the Lord,
   speaking by Moses, calls the Tabernacle mvd, (mogned,) and says, I will
   meet with you there. (Exodus 25:21, 22, 29:42.) Let us not think,
   therefore, that it means an assembly of men, as when irreligious
   persons assemble to their fairs or festivals, but that the Lord
   intended to give a token of his presence, and there to ratify his
   covenant. This ought to be carefully observed; for the blasphemy of the
   wicked king is proved by this, that he attacked heaven itself rather
   than an earthly place.

   14. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. [225] It might
   certainly be thought strange that the Prophet thus accuses the
   Babylonian monarch, as if he wished to make himself equal to God,
   since, as we have said, this thought could scarcely enter into the mind
   of a man without making him absolutely shudder. As there is a seed of
   religion implanted in us by nature, so we are constrained, even against
   our will, to entertain the belief of some superior being who excells
   all things; and no man is so mad as to wish to cast down God from his
   throne; for we are instructed by nature that we ought to worship and
   adore God. Hence also the Gentiles, though they were ignorant of God,
   rendered worship to their idols; and therefore it may be thought
   improbable that the king of Babylon wished to drive out God, and to
   reign in heaven.

   And yet the Prophet does not accuse him falsely. Though the ungodly do
   not believe that they ought to reign instead of God, yet, when they
   exalt themselves more than is proper, they take away a portion of what
   belongs to him, and claim it for themselves, which is the same as if
   they wished to pull him down from his throne. And what did Satan say
   when he deceived our first parent? Ye shall be as gods. (Genesis 3:5.)
   Consequently, all who dare to ascribe more to themselves than God
   allows are chargeable with exalting themselves against God, as if they
   declared war against him; for where pride is, contempt of God must be
   there.

   We ought also to observe that argument which we lately noticed, that
   the tyrant, by assailing the Church, which was God's holy heritage,
   might be said intentionally to attack God. Since, therefore, he
   profaned the heavenly sanctuary, the language ought not to be thought
   exaggerated. Hence also we obtain a doctrine full of most valuable
   consolation, for we are taught that the ungodly exalt themselves
   against God whenever they attack his Church. He is not accused of
   exalting himself above angels, but of endeavoring to crush the Church
   of God. The worship of God is not now confined to one place, but is as
   extensive as the whole world. Whenever, therefore, men call on the name
   of God, if any tyrant rise up to oppress the godly, let us know that he
   attacks not men, but God himself, who at length will not endure to be
   insulted.

   We shall afterwards meet with a similar example in Sennacherib, of whom
   Isaiah declares that, while he threatened and reproached Zion, he
   threatened and reproached God himself. Let us therefore know that we
   are under the protection of God in such a manner, that any one who
   gives us trouble will also have God for his enemy.

   He that hurteth you, says he, hurteth the apple of mine eye. (Zechariah
   2:8.)

   He likewise testifies that he dwells in the midst of the Church, (Psalm
   46:5,) so that no one can attack the Church without receiving the first
   strokes; and therefore he will avenge the injuries which the Church
   endures, though he may permit her to be afflicted for a time.

   15. But thou shalt be brought down to the grave. He formerly explained
   the intention of the king of Babylon, which was, that he should place
   his throne above the clouds; but he now contrasts with it an opposite
   event, namely, the sides of the pit or ditch, that is, some corner of a
   sepulcher into which he shall be thrown. He had formerly said that the
   king of Babylon wished to be carried up to Mount Zion, to the sides of
   the north, because that was a very lofty situation, and widely seen. He
   now uses the word sides in an opposite sense, as if he had said that he
   would have an abode in the most contemptible part of a sepulcher, as
   when one is thrust into a mean and despicable corner. In a wide and
   large sepulcher they place the dead bodies of honorable men in the
   middle; but the Prophet means that he will be thrown into a corner, or
   into the outer edges. Thus the Lord from on high laughs at the pride of
   the ungodly, so that, when they shall have swallowed up everything by
   their covetousness, and shall have burst through the clouds and heaven
   itself by their effrontery, he will at length expose them to the
   mockery of all, after having, in the twinkling of an eye, overturned
   their schemes.

   16. They that see thee. The Prophet again, personating the dead, mocks
   at that wicked king. It might also be viewed as relating to the living;
   but it is better to apply the whole of this discourse to the dead, if
   we would not rather refer it to the grave itself, which amounts nearly
   to the same thing. We are wont to stretch out our neck when we meet
   with anything that is strange, or that deserves our attention. Thus,
   when it was thought to be a kind of prodigy that this king, who
   possessed so great power, had died, the Prophet says that the eyes of
   all men were directed towards him, to look at him earnestly, as if they
   scarcely believed their own eyes.

   Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that shook kingdoms?
   They first ask, if it be possible that he who, by the slightest
   expression of his will, made the earth to tremble, should be so quickly
   and easily laid low. Next, he mentions that this man was eager, but is
   unable, to destroy everything, and shows that tyrants, with all their
   cruelty, are like clouds, which pour down a sudden shower of rain or
   hail, as if they would destroy everything, but are scattered in a
   moment. This comparison was also employed by the good old Athanasius,
   when some one threatened him with the rage of the Emperor Julian.
   Isaiah shows that this change proceeds from the hand of God, who, by
   the slightest expression of his will, can overturn the whole world.

   17. He made the world as a wilderness. He expresses the cruel and
   savage disposition of the tyrant, by saying that he brought desolation
   on the world, that he overthrew cities, that he did not release
   prisoners. It is sometimes the custom of conquerors to release
   prisoners, in order to win their hearts by kindness; but tyrants choose
   rather to be feared than to be loved. They think that the only way to
   reign is to strike terror into all by inexorable cruelty. There is no
   reason to wonder, therefore, that their end is so wretched and dismal;
   for it is impossible that the Lord should not, after having chastised
   his Church by their cruelty, give them like for like, and withhold all
   compassion from those who failed to exercise compassion to others. He
   therefore shows how wretched tyrants are, for they have God for their
   enemy, and are hated by men.

   18. All the kings of the nations. He contrasts the king of Babylon with
   other kings, in order to show that, after his death, he will be more
   wretched than all the rest. And thus by comparison he gives a more
   enlarged view of the judgment of God, by which he would avenge the
   injuries done to his Church. This passage is the reason why I do not
   venture to limit, what Isaiah here foretells about the king of Babylon,
   to the person of Nebuchadnezzar alone; because it does not appear from
   history that he was denied burial. The Jews, indeed, relate that
   Evil-merodach gave orders that he should be dug out of his grave,
   because the nobles of the kingdom would not venture to pay homage to
   him, unless there were evidence that his father was dead; but Jerome,
   though otherwise credulous enough, treats this as a fable.

   He therefore describes, not a single man, but a whole dynasty; and, in
   like manner, when Scripture speaks of Antichrist, it includes the whole
   duration of his reign. Consequently, as if in the person of one man,
   the Prophet ridicules the pride of all those tyrants, and threatens
   what shall be their end, namely this, that they shall not have a spot
   of earth to bury them, though formerly they were insatiable whirlpools,
   and could not be satisfied with any possessions. They who have scarcely
   a foot of earth still retain their right to have a grave, which was
   also highly prized by the patriarchs; for it was reckoned disgraceful
   to be deprived of it.

   19. But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch. He
   shows that the kings of Babylon will be loaded with such disgrace, that
   they will even be cast out of the sepulcher which they possessed by
   inheritance, and will exhibit a disgraceful spectacle. It may be asked,
   Is it of so great value in the sight of God to be buried with our
   fathers, that to be deprived of it should be reckoned a punishment and
   a curse? I answer, he does not here speak of the grave, as if it were
   necessary for salvation; but it ought justly to be reckoned disgraceful
   to be denied burial. And first, we ought to consider why burial has
   been so highly valued among all nations. This undoubtedly arose from
   the patriarchs, whose bodies the Lord commanded to be buried in the
   hope of the last resurrection. The carcases of beasts are cast out,
   because they are only fit for rotting; but ours are laid in the earth,
   that being kept there, they may await the last day, when they shall
   rise to enjoy a blessed and immortal life in union with the soul.

   Various superstitions have arisen as to the interment of bodies. This
   has undoubtedly been occasioned by the craftiness of Satan, who usually
   corrupts and perverts everything that is good and useful, for he
   devised innumerable contrivances by which he might dazzle the eyes of
   men. We need not wonder that the Jews had a great variety of ceremonies
   connected with this subject, and they cannot be blamed on account of
   it, for Christ had not yet been revealed, and consequently they had not
   so clear a revelation of the resurrection. But in our time the case is
   very different, for we plainly see the resurrection in Christ, and,
   every vail having now been removed, we behold clear promises which were
   more obscure to the Jews. If any one, therefore, were again to
   introduce and renew those ancient rites, he would undoubtedly darken
   the light, and, by putting a vail on Christ who has been revealed to
   us, would offer to him a high insult. Yet it is not useless to pay
   attention to burial, for it is the symbol of the last resurrection,
   which we still look for; but let there be no superstition and
   ostentatious display in funerals, which all godly persons ought to
   detest.

   Now, if any one has been entirely deprived of burial, we must examine
   the cause. Many of the prophets, martyrs, and holy men have been
   deprived of it. We hear the Church bewailing that

   the dead bodies of the servants of God have been thrown down to wild
   beasts and to the fowls of heaven, and that there is none to bury them,
   (Psalm 79:2, 3;)

   and every day we see the servants of Christ burned, or drowned, or
   hanged; and yet their death is glorious and blessed in the sight of
   God. As the cross of Christ was blessed, so crosses, chains, prisons,
   and deaths, which are endured by his members, share in the same
   blessing, and far exceed the prosperity and trappings and splendor and
   majesty of kings, so that, following the example of Paul, they boldly
   venture even to glory in them. (Romans 5:3; 2 Corinthians 12:5;
   Galatians 6:14.)

   But as to those whom the Lord permits to remain unburied, when we see
   nothing else than a token of his anger, we must fall back on this
   statement and others of the same kind. For example, Jeremiah threatened
   Jehoiakim with the burial of an ass, because he deserved to be ranked
   with beasts rather than with men, who, even after death, are
   distinguished from beasts by being buried. Thus it was proper that the
   king of Babylon, who had exalted himself above all men, should be cast
   down below all men, so as even to be deprived of ordinary burial.
   Isaiah, therefore, foretells that he will not be buried in his own
   house, that is, in the sepulcher of his fathers, which came to him by
   inheritance; for we must not suppose that sepulchres were within
   houses. [226] The comparisons which are added express more strongly the
   disgrace which was due to that tyrant. As hurtful or useless trees are
   rooted out, so he shows that the king of Babylon does not deserve to
   have any place among men.

   As the garments of those who are slain. They who fall in the field of
   battle are not buried in the ordinary way, but their bloody and
   stinking bodies are trodden down, and are thrown into a ditch along
   with their rotten garments, that they may not infect the air with their
   offensive smell; and no one deigns to touch the very garments defiled
   by mire and blood, lest he should be polluted by them. Which of the
   kings of Babylon it was that suffered this we cannot tell; but
   undoubtedly it was fulfilled.

   20. For thou hast laid thy land desolate. This is the reason why he
   says that the king of Babylon did not deserve burial. He who has laid
   the earth desolate does not deserve that the earth shall receive him
   into its bosom and cover him. As the earth supports the living, so it
   covers the dead, and keeps them till the coming of Christ. It is
   therefore a just punishment of cruelty, when the earth refuses to
   receive into her bosom those who have dishonored her. There is added a
   threatening still more severe, that the Lord will also inflict on
   posterity the remainder of the punishment.

   The seed of the wicked shall not be continually remembered. There are
   two ways in which we may explain this clause, either that the
   remembrance of the seed of the wicked will not be of long duration, or
   that it will be altogether extinguished. The word lvlm [227] (legnolam)
   may be translated in various ways, for it may refer either to the past
   or to the future. If we refer it to the past, the meaning will be,
   "Although the seed of the wicked be renowned, lvlm, (legnolam,) for a
   time, yet the remembrance of it will at length pass away." If we refer
   it to the future, the meaning will be, "God will extinguish the seed of
   the wicked, so that it shall never again be mentioned." It usually
   happens that the Lord curses the seed of the wicked, as, on the other
   hand, he blesses the seed of the godly, (Proverbs 10:7;) and as the
   righteous shall be held in perpetual remembrance, (Psalm 112:6,) so the
   remembrance of the wicked must be destroyed and cut off. (Psalm 34:16.)
   Though we do not always behold these things with our eyes, yet there
   are abundant and clear proofs of the fact, by which it is fully
   confirmed.

   But we must attend to the reason of this vengeance. The Lord punishes
   the pride of wicked men, who wish to spread their name, and to leave a
   perpetual remembrance of them; for all irreligious men have this for
   the object of their labors and exertions. On the other hand, the Lord
   blots out their name and remembrance, which appeared to be inscribed on
   lasting records; and the result is, that they are not only despised but
   even abhorred by all men. This happens to all tyrants, that though,
   while they live, they are universally applauded and flattered, yet
   after they are dead, they and their posterity are universally abhorred.
   It is therefore evident that they are detested by God, by angels, and
   by men.

   21. Prepare slaughter for his children. Here Isaiah prophesies more
   plainly than before against the king of Babylon. He speaks of the whole
   of his descendants, to whom he intimates that this destruction extends.
   We must keep in mind what we formerly said, that hitherto the Prophet
   has spoken not of a single man, but of a whole dynasty; and now he
   removes all doubt as to the metaphorical language. The rendering given
   by the old translation, Prepare his children for the slaughter, does
   not agree well; for the preposition l, (lamed,) which is prefixed,
   evidently shows that it ought to be translated to or for the children.

   We must see to whom this discourse relates. It must be understood that
   reference is made, though not directly expressed, to some servants as
   officers or executioners, whom the Lord orders to be in a state of
   preparation for executing his judgments. And who were they? Partly the
   Medes and Persians, and partly others by whom Babylon was completely
   overthrown; for, as we have formerly said, Babylon was not entirely
   destroyed when the Persians subdued it. He therefore addresses those
   whom the Lord, by his eternal decree, had appointed to destroy Babylon.
   This mode of expression is more energetic than if he had merely said
   that slaughter was prepared; for he shows that he not only disposes of
   wicked men according to his pleasure, but that he has servants at hand
   to punish their sins.

   For the iniquity of their fathers. When he says that in this manner the
   iniquity of the fathers is punished, it may at first sight appear to be
   excessively harsh to include the children along with the fathers in
   what relates to the infliction of punishment on them, and still more
   harsh, that the punishment due to the fathers should be extended even
   to their children and grandchildren. This inconsistency may easily be
   avoided if the word vn (gnavon) be translated misery; for it denotes
   the punishment of sin as well as sin itself. (Exodus 20:5, 34:7;
   Deuteronomy 5:9; Jeremiah 32:18.) But as it is frequently stated in
   Scripture, that God recompenses the sins of the parents into the bosom
   of the children, there is no necessity for evading it in this manner.

   Nor is this inconsistent with what is said by Ezekiel,

   The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father.
   (Ezekiel 18:20.)

   God does not punish any innocent person; and this passage ought not to
   be understood as if the punishment due to ancestors were transferred by
   God to children who in other respects deserved no such punishment; for
   the guilt of the children is connected with the guilt of the fathers.
   Not to mention the universal curse of the human race, to which all are
   subject from the womb, let us take the example of some wicked man. When
   the Lord casts away that man and his posterity, we certainly have no
   right to remonstrate with him. If his blessing is free and undeserved,
   we have no right to constrain him, because he does not bestow it
   equally on all. His grace is free; and each of us ought to reflect,
   that anything good which we have, does not naturally belong to us, but,
   on the contrary, comes from another quarter, and has proceeded from the
   undeserved goodness of God. If, therefore, he cast off any one, must
   not that man's seed also be accursed? When we are destitute of his
   grace, what remains but iniquity? And if they are liable to eternal
   death, much more to temporal punishments; for he who has been condemned
   to undergo capital punishment, deserves much more to endure
   imprisonment and scourging.

   This ought to be carefully observed. I consider it to be a childish
   reply that is given by those who think that the Lord inflicts temporal
   punishments on the children of wicked men for the sins of their
   parents, and who do not look upon it as unworthy of God to inflict
   punishments of this nature even on innocent persons; for God never
   punishes those who do not deserve it, and he is by nature inclined to
   compassion; and how would he spare wicked men if he exercised his wrath
   against the innocent? We ought, therefore, to hold it as a settled
   point, that all who are destitute of the grace of God are involved in
   the sentence of eternal death. Hence it follows, that the children of
   the reprobate, whom the curse of God pursues, are liable to the same
   sentence. Isaiah, therefore, does not speak of innocent children, but
   of flagitious and unprincipled children, who perhaps even exceeded
   their parents in wickedness; in consequence of which they were justly
   associated with their parents, and subjected to the same punishment,
   seeing that they have followed the same manner of life.

   It will be said, that in that case they suffer the punishment of their
   own sin and not of their parents. This, I acknowledge, is partly true;
   but it was with their parents that the rejection began, on account of
   which they also have been forsaken and rejected by God. Their own guilt
   is not set aside as if they had been innocent; but, having been
   involved in the same sins as to reprobation, they are also liable to
   the same punishments and miseries. I am aware that this solution does
   not satisfy those who never cease to quarrel with God; but I give
   myself little concern about them, provided that I satisfy godly persons
   and those who are not fond of disputing; and these, I hope and trust,
   will be well satisfied with this reply, which is true.

   That they may not fill the face of the world with cities. Some render
   it, that they may not fill the face of the earth with enemies; as if
   the Prophet meant that all wicked men are enemies of the human race, or
   rather of the whole earth; and, therefore, that the Lord provides for
   the safety of all, when he takes them out of the midst; for the earth
   would otherwise be choked by them as by thorns and briers. But this
   signification appears to express something more; for the earth receives
   us into her bosom, if we do our duty; and if we be despisers of God,
   the earth, even against her will, nourishes and supports us as enemies.

   But I would rather follow another signification, which is more commonly
   received. I think that the Prophet intimates that wicked men have a
   numerous progeny, and that they surpass others both in numbers and in
   display, which we also see taking place every day, and which has
   originated the proverb, that "a bad reed grows quickly." The Prophet,
   therefore, insinuates, that wicked men would fill the whole earth not
   only with men, but also with towns, if the Lord did not beforehand
   perceive and guard against this evil, and diminish their number. When
   we everywhere see a vast multitude of wicked men, by whom the earth is
   almost overwhelmed, it is what we richly deserve; but the Lord never
   deals so harshly with us as not to leave some remnant of good seed,
   however small, and likewise to reserve some corners of the earth in
   which godly men shall have a little breathing. And if the Lord did not
   cut off a large proportion of wicked men, the earth would undoubtedly
   be soon overwhelmed by them.

   This confirms what we have already said, that the children of the
   Babylonians who were slain were not innocent, for here the cause is
   assigned, that they may not fill the earth with cities. It follows,
   therefore, that they were wicked, and are taken away by a righteous
   judgment, that provision may be made for the salvation of men, and that
   the Lord cannot be accused of harshness and cruelty.

   22. For I will rise up against them. The Lord now declares that he will
   do what he had formerly, by the Prophet, commanded others to do. Both
   statements ought to be observed, that it is the work of God, when
   wicked men are ruined, though he may employ the agency of men in
   executing his judgments. He formerly addressed them, saying, Prepare.
   (Verse. 21.) This should lead us to observe not only the power of God,
   but likewise the efficacy of prophecy, in consequence of which the
   prophets, by the appointment of God, command all nations to do this or
   that; and next, that men are so far from being able to hinder the
   accomplishment that they are even constrained to yield obedience to
   God. As we usually rely on men, and, by neglecting God, attribute to
   them the power of doing everything, we ought to hold by this principle,
   that since God acts by means of them, he is, strictly speaking, the
   Author of the work, and that they are only servants or instruments.
   This is clearly enough shown by the connection of what immediately
   follows.

   I have thought it best to view the particle v (vau) as meaning for. He
   assigns the reason why he enjoins the Medes and others to prepare
   destruction to the Babylonians, For I will rise up against them. This
   mode of expression, by which the Lord says that he riseth up, is
   sufficiently common. By means of it, the Prophet accommodates himself
   to our capacity, for the majesty of God is so high that we cannot
   conceive of it. We think that God is idle and unoccupied, so long as he
   winks at men; and therefore he says that he riseth up, when he exerts
   his power, and manifests it by some visible act.

   Saith the Lord of hosts. This title serves to confirm the statement; as
   if he had said that he did not, without good grounds, claim the
   government over the nations; for God governs all armies by his own
   hand. Since, therefore, he has been appointed to make known the purpose
   of God, it belongs to him to command men, that they may yield obedience
   to him. By the words saith the Lord, which he twice repeats in this
   verse, he affirms that he utters nothing but what has been commanded by
   God, that this prophecy may carry greater weight.

   And I will cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, son and grandson.
   It has been often enough mentioned before, that this destruction did
   not overtake Babylon till after the death of Alexander the Great. By
   the phrase sons and grandsons, he means not only the posterity but the
   remembrance, which wicked men are so desirous to obtain, in order that
   they may be applauded for many ages after their death. This also the
   Lord took away from Babylon, that no remembrance of it might remain,
   but what was accompanied by dishonor and reproach.

   23. And I will make it to be a possession of the hedgehog. [228] He
   again confirms the same things which he formerly predicted, namely,
   that henceforth it will not be a habitation of men, but will resemble a
   hideous cavern, in which wild beasts shall lurk. qphd (kippod) is
   rendered by some a beaver, by some a tortoise, and by others a
   hedgehog. From the connection of the passage, it is probable that the
   Prophet spoke of an animal that is found near the water; for he
   afterwards mentions pools of water. This applies strictly to the
   situation of the place, for though Babylon did not lie in a marsh, yet
   it lay in a moist place, the country around it being watered on one
   side by the Euphrates, and on the other by the Tigris. Hence the Lord
   threatens to bring a deluge upon it. [229]

   24. The Lord of hosts hath sworn. For more full confirmation an oath
   was necessary. There is nothing of which it is more difficult to
   convince us than that wicked men will immediately be ruined, when we
   see them flourishing, and furnished with all means of defense, and
   seemingly placed out of danger, and free from all fear. We are
   therefore stunned by beholding them, and are dazzled by their
   brightness, so that we can scarcely believe God when he foretells their
   ruin and destruction. On this account he employs an oath, that he may
   leave no room for doubt. Hence we learn how great is his forbearance
   towards us, when he aids our weakness by applying this remedy, for
   otherwise he might have been satisfied with simply declaring it. This
   tends to the consolation of the godly, as we shall afterwards see.
   (Isaiah 22:14.)

   If it hath not been as I thought. The elliptical form of an oath which
   he employs must be well known, for it occurs frequently in Scripture.
   The Lord purposely used this guarded language, that we might not be too
   free in the use of oaths, which burst from us daringly and at random.
   He suppresses the greater part of the oath. "If I shall not do what I
   have decreed, let men think that I am a liar, and let them not think
   that I am God;" or something of this kind (which we shudder to express)
   is left to be supplied. Men ought, therefore, to lay a bridle on
   themselves, so as not to break out at random into imprecations, or to
   pronounce shocking curses against themselves; but let them learn from
   this to restrain their insolence.

   25. That I may bruise the Assyrian in my land. Some think that this
   relates to Sennacherib's army, which the hand of God destroyed by means
   of an angel, when he besieged Jerusalem. (2 Kings 19:35; Isaiah 37:36.)
   If this interpretation be preferred, the meaning will be, that the Lord
   will shortly give some evidence of that destruction which he has
   threatened against the Babylonians. Those who heard these predictions
   might have brought this objection: "Of what avail will it be to us that
   Babylon is destroyed, after Babylon has ruined us? Would it not have
   been better that both Babylon and we had remained uninjured? What
   consolation will be yielded to us by its destruction, when we, too,
   shall have been destroyed?" And, indeed, I have no doubt that he holds
   out a proof of God's favor in destroying their enemies, which either
   had been already manifested, or would be manifested soon afterwards.

   I dare not affirm at what time this prediction was uttered by the
   Prophet, but it may be conjectured with some probability that the
   slaughter of Sennacherib's army by the angel had already taken place.
   In this way, from a striking event which they had known, the Prophet
   would lead them to expect a future redemption; as if he had said, "You
   have already perceived how wonderfully God assists his people at the
   very hour of danger." I am thus prepared to assign a reason for
   thinking that Sennacherib's army had been already slain. Undoubtedly
   this instruction must have been of some use.

   But Babylon did not begin to give any annoyance to the Jews before she
   had subdued the Assyrians and renewed the monarchy. So long, therefore,
   as the Jews had nothing to do with Babylon, why did the Prophet speak
   of the judgment of God, by which he would avenge his people? There is
   no absurdity in supposing that the record of a past event is confounded
   with a prediction. And yet it will not be inadmissible to say that the
   Assyrians are here put for the Chaldeans; for though they had been
   deprived of the government, yet it is probable that they were always
   first in a state of readiness whenever there was an opportunity of
   attacking the Jews, and that, while they fought under foreign leaders,
   they formed the greater part of the army. Not only were they nearer
   than the Chaldeans, but those who at that time held the sway were aware
   that their inveterate hostility against the Jews would make them loyal
   and obedient in that war. Besides, it was advantageous to the
   conquerors to weaken the vanquished by continual wars, till they had
   been accustomed to bear the yoke.

   Most appropriately, therefore, by a figure of speech in which a part is
   taken for the whole, Isaiah, though he is speaking of Babylon,
   describes the whole of its forces under the name of Assyria. There will
   thus be no argument which lays us under the necessity of explaining
   this passage as relating to the slaughter effected by the angel in
   Sennacherib's army. The Prophet merely affirms, so far as my judgment
   goes, that the Lord will put an end to the tyranny of the Assyrians, so
   that they shall not always enjoy their present superiority. As if he
   had said, "Though for a time God permits wicked men to rule over you,
   this power will not always last; for one day he will, as it were, break
   the yoke, and deliver this people from this bondage under which they
   groan." The Assyrians, though they were vanquished by the Chaldeans,
   did not on that account, as we have said, cease to be enemies of the
   Church; but Babylon, which had succeeded in the room of Nineveh, began
   at that time, by a kind of transferred right, to carry on war with the
   Jews.

   And his yoke shall depart from them, and his burden shall be taken from
   their shoulder. When he says that the Assyrian will be broken in Judea,
   this must not be understood as if they would be slain there, or that
   they would be instantly crushed by some calamity; but that the chosen
   people would be delivered from their tyranny, and that their authority
   would thus be taken away. The breaking, therefore, does not refer so
   much to persons as to the empire. What he says about the yoke and the
   burden would not apply strictly to the Assyrians alone, who at least
   never were masters of the city of Jerusalem; and therefore we must
   attend to the succession which I mentioned, for the Chaldeans had no
   right to carry on war except that right which they boasted of as having
   been conveyed to them by the Assyrians. Thus I think that I am
   justified in extending this prophecy to that deliverance by which the
   Lord showed that he would avenge his people against the Chaldeans and
   Assyrians; for at that time the yoke was shaken off by which the Jews
   were miserably held bound, and it even includes the redemption obtained
   through Christ, of which that deliverance was a forerunner.

   And upon my mountains I will tread him under feet. Some think that the
   word mountains is put in the plural number for Mount Zion; but I prefer
   a different interpretation. Jerusalem being situated among the
   mountains, the whole country around was despised for that reason. The
   Prophet therefore speaks contemptuously, as if he admitted that the
   country was regarded by the enemies as of little value because it was
   mountainous. But this very contempt serves to magnify the power of God;
   for he shakes off from his mountains the dominion of this powerful
   monarchy. This refers to the narrative contained in 1 Kings 20:23, 28

   26. This purpose which is purposed upon the whole earth. The Lord is
   not satisfied with one or two confirmations, and can scarcely refrain
   from proclaiming it more and more abundantly, because he knows well
   that our minds are naturally prone to distrust. No confirmation
   suffices for us, even though his promises be frequent and copious and
   solemn. God therefore wishes to remedy this disease, and that is the
   design of the repetition, so that we must not think that it is
   superfluous. They who suppose that the Prophet, or rather the Spirit of
   God, uses too many words, are not well acquainted with themselves.

   He declares, first, the will and purpose of God, and, secondly, his
   power. How comes it that we have any doubts about the word, but because
   we do not ascribe to God that power which belongs to him, or because we
   are not convinced of his power? These are the only two causes of our
   unbelief, with which, on the other hand, we ought to contrast the two
   things which Isaiah recommends to our notice, namely, the purpose and
   the power of God. We ought to believe, first, that God is true, for he
   declares nothing that is not fixed and unchangeable; and, secondly,
   that he is powerful, and that nothing can withstand his arm. Again, we
   must not inquire about the secret purpose of God: for the Prophet here
   enjoins us to rest satisfied with the decree which has been manifested
   in the word of God. We must not rise any higher, therefore, so as to
   penetrate into the secrets of God; but we ought to be satisfied with
   undoubted proofs which he declares by the mouth of the prophets. Let us
   therefore embrace all the promises of God with our whole heart, and let
   us also add to them his power; for his hand ought never to be separated
   from his mouth. We must not imagine his power to be, as philosophers
   talk, a power that is unemployed, but, as the Scriptures teach us,
   powerful and active.

   A question may here arise, Why does he mention the whole earth and all
   the nations, when he is only speaking about Babylon? But we must keep
   in remembrance what we formerly said, that the Babylonian empire, after
   having swallowed up Nineveh, extended nearly through the whole of the
   east, and that various nations were subject to it. The consequence was,
   that the devastation of that empire was also the destruction of the
   whole world; for such great monarchies cannot fall without involving
   many in an extensive ruin. Accordingly, as the extent of that empire
   might lead men to call in question this prophecy, Isaiah shows that,
   though it be spread far and wide, and includes a boundless multitude of
   nations, that does not prevent God from executing his decree.

   27. For the Lord of hosts hath decreed. Isaiah here employs what may be
   regarded as a concluding exclamation, to confirm more fully the
   preceding statement. Having said that it is the purpose of the Lord, in
   order to show that it cannot be broken or made void, (Psalm 33:11,) he
   puts a question as if about a thing impossible, Who shall disannul his
   purpose? or, who shall turn back his hand? By this exclamation he
   speaks disdainfully of all the creatures; for as soon as the Lord has
   decreed, he stretches out his hand, and when his hand is stretched out,
   the execution of the work must undoubtedly follow. Nor is it only men
   whom he declares to be incapable, but he also declares everything else
   to be incapable of preventing the decree of God; at least if there be
   anything but man and Satan that opposes his will. In short, he
   intimates that there can be no repentance or change in God, (Numbers
   23:19,) but that whatever may happen, even amidst an endless diversity
   of events, he continues always to be like himself, and that no
   occurrence can thwart his purpose.

   If it be objected that God sometimes changed his purpose, as when he
   spared the Ninevites, (Jonah 1:2, 3:10,) Abimelech, (Genesis 20:3, 17,)
   or Pharaoh, (Genesis 12:17,) the answer is easy. When the Lord sent
   Jonah to the Ninevites, he did not reveal what had been decreed in his
   secret purpose, but wished to arouse their minds by the preaching of
   Jonah, that he might have compassion on them. The same thing might be
   said, when he threatened Abimelech and Pharaoh, because they wished to
   lay hands on Abraham's wife; for thus the Lord, by terrifying them,
   intended to keep them back, that they might not suffer the punishment
   of their obstinacy.

   28. In the year that King Ahaz died. Here the fifteenth chapter ought
   to have begun, for the Prophet enters on a new subject; and this
   plainly shows how absurdly the chapters are divided, or rather torn
   asunder. Having spoken of the Babylonians, he passes to the
   Philistines; [230] or, perhaps, before speaking of the Babylonians, he
   addressed the Philistines, who, being the near neighbors of the Jews,
   cherished deadly hostility against them. They were the remainder of
   those nations whom the Israelites spared, though the Lord had commanded
   that they should be removed out of the midst of them. (Numbers 33:52;
   Deuteronomy 7:16.) Their unbelief in this matter was the reason why the
   Lord left these nations to be thorns, that they might prick their eyes;
   as the Scripture shows that the Lord had formerly threatened against
   them. (Numbers 33:55.) In consequence of the deadly animosities which
   existed between these two nations, whenever the Jews sustained any
   defeat, the Philistines reckoned it to be so much gain to themselves;
   for they wished the ruin of the Jews, and no occurrence could give them
   greater delight than when the Jews were reduced to the deepest
   adversity and distress. The Prophet therefore prophesies against them
   as against the constant enemies of the Church.

   It is proper to attend to the time when this vision was exhibited to
   the Prophet. So long as Ahaz lived, the Philistines were victorious.
   That wicked hypocrite, who had forsaken God, and eagerly sought the
   outward assistance of man, was punished for his treachery. During his
   reign the Philistines (2 Chronicles 28:18) recovered those towns which
   Uzziah (2 Chronicles 26:6, 7) had taken out of their hands; but after
   his death, they became still more courageous, for they expected that
   they would then gain all that they desired, because he who had been
   left as his heir was still a child; for Hezekiah, the new king, had
   neither shrewdness, nor authority, nor wisdom. These circumstances,
   therefore, ought to be carefully observed; for Isaiah has not the
   Philistines so much in his view, though he speaks to them, as the
   godly, whom he wishes to comfort and strengthen with good hope by this
   prophecy, who would otherwise have thought that the condition of Judea
   was entirely ruined, because they were attacked by enemies on all
   sides, and no assistance of any kind could be seen. To those persons,
   therefore, in their distressed and forlorn condition, Isaiah stretches
   out his hand, and bids them be of good courage, because the Lord would
   undoubtedly assist them.

   This burden. He calls this prophecy a burden, because it would be
   disagreeable and painful to the Philistines, who thought that they had
   got rid of every annoyance, because the Jews were hard pressed, and had
   no hope of bettering their condition; and therefore he threatens that
   the destruction of the Philistines also is at hand.

   29. Rejoice not, thou whole Philistia. [231] He begins by checking the
   vain and groundless confidence with which the Philistines were puffed
   up, and, by adding Thou whole, he intimates that all of them would feel
   a portion of this calamity; as if he had said that not only would that
   country be laid waste in some part, but that there would not be a
   corner of it exempted from the stroke, and that, in all its length and
   breadth, it would immediately and universally be visited with
   destruction.

   Because the rod of him that smote thee is broken. Some think that by
   the broken rod is meant King Ahaz, but that view is unfounded; for in
   all his battles with the Philistines he was vanquished. (2 Chronicles
   28:18.) It must therefore be referred to Uzziah, (2 Chronicles 26:6,)
   and yet I would not choose to limit it even to him, but would at the
   same time refer it to the whole body of the Jewish people. It is as if
   he had said to Palestina, "Thinkest thou that thou art safe, when the
   Jews, who formerly distressed thee, have been subdued? Thou art greatly
   deceived; for very soon shalt thou be more severely distressed." For
   this reason, as I have said, I do not limit it to any one person, but
   think that in the person of one man is described the whole body of the
   Jews.

   For out of the adder's root shall spring a cockatrice, and his fruit
   shall be a fiery serpent. He now assigns the reason why Palestina ought
   not to rejoice; namely, that the Jews would have more power than ever
   to do injury; that if the Philistines had formerly sustained damage
   from them, they would afterwards sustain greater and heavier damage.
   The metaphor which he employs is highly appropriate; for the cockatrice
   is more hurtful than the adder, and the fiery serpent is more hurtful
   than the cockatrice. Through the kindness of God we have no animals so
   destructive in the countries which we inhabit. But the Prophet means
   nothing else than that the power of doing them injury has been taken
   away from the Jews; and therefore I differ from others who view the
   name of the adder and of the fiery serpent as applying to Hezekiah
   only. Though that opinion derives great plausibility from the
   circumstance that Hezekiah held all that belonged to the Philistines,
   as far as Gaza, (2 Kings 18:8,) yet the Prophet intended that this
   promise should extend farther. Let us therefore know that the favor of
   which the Prophet now speaks, though it began with Hezekiah, belongs to
   the Jews as to one body.

   We ought to draw from it a general statement, that when we are weighed
   down by adversity, and when the ungodly rejoice as if we were ruined,
   and as if they alone were prosperous, God declares that their joy is
   without foundation. The Church will always rise again, and be restored
   to her former and prosperous condition, though all conclude that she is
   ruined. The children of God shall acquire new vigor, that they may
   pierce the eyes of the ungodly; not that they wish this, or have any
   such intention, but because the decree of God makes it necessary that
   this shall take place.

   The names of cockatrice and fiery serpent do not imply reproach. In
   their own nature the godly are not such, but they are so called,
   because they are hurtful to the wicked, though in themselves harmless;
   for it is through the fault and the malice of the wicked that what
   ought to have been useful and profitable is hurtful to them. Such is
   also the nature of God himself, (Psalm 18:26,) and of the gospel, (2
   Corinthians 2:16.)

   30. And the first-born of the poor shall feed. The Prophet, as has been
   already said, has not so much in view the Philistines, to whom his
   threatenings were of no avail, as the Jews, whom he wished to comfort
   in their affliction; for they were so grievously afflicted that they
   were not far from despair. He therefore calls them the first-born of
   the poor, as being eminent for their wretchedness; for, being reduced
   to extremities, they held the first rank among the wretched. Now, he
   promises that the Lord will deliver them from such misery, and will
   again feed and nourish them. Hence we perceive that the Philistines
   were cut down and destroyed for the benefit of the people of God. In
   like manner, also, the Lord promised to Abraham and his posterity, I
   will bless them that bless thee, and I will curse them that curse thee;
   for those who are hostile to the children of God must find that God is
   hostile to them. (Genesis 12:3.)

   And the needy shall lie down in safety. The Prophet compares his people
   to sheep, whom we must resemble, if we wish to have God for our keeper.
   No metaphor is more frequently employed in Scripture than this. When
   the Lord chastises us, we are like sheep that are scattered, and
   exposed to wolves and robbers; but when he punishes our enemies, he
   intends to gather us together again, that we may dwell in a safe and
   quiet place. This is what Isaiah means when he says, in safety. There
   are therefore two things which the Lord here promises; first, pastures,
   that is, everything that is necessary for food and raiment; and,
   secondly, safety and protection, that we may be protected and defended
   from every injury. These two things belong to the duty of a shepherd,
   and they include all that is necessary for our salvation.

   And I will kill thy root with famine. He now turns to the Philistines,
   whom he compares to a tree which strikes its roots so deep that we
   would be apt to think that it cannot in any way be rooted out. But if
   the root be dried up, the tree also, however deeply laid, must decay.
   Hence we ought to infer that the condition of the wicked is never so
   firmly established that the Lord cannot easily overturn it; for not
   only will he cut off branches, but he will also dry up and destroy the
   root which is hidden under ground.

   And he will slay thy remnant. This is commonly viewed as referring to
   Hezekiah; but I prefer, as I have already explained, to extend it to
   the whole body, of which he speaks as of one man, and of which the king
   was the head, and represented Christ himself. We might also refer it to
   the Assyrians, and to any others, whose agency the Lord employed in
   destroying the Philistines; for it is customary with the Jews to employ
   indefinite language when they speak of the agents by means of whom God
   executes his judgments.

   31. Howl, O gate. Here the Prophet makes use of amplifications, that by
   means of them he may seal his predictions on the hearts of the godly,
   and may press with greater earnestness those things of which they might
   otherwise have entertained doubts. In explaining another passage, where
   it is said that her gates shall mourn and lament, (Isaiah 3:26,) we
   have stated that the gates mean crowded places, in which public
   meetings were held. [232] He threatens that there will be mourning in
   each of the cities, and mourning of no ordinary kind, for it will be
   spread through every one of the most crowded assemblies.

   For a smoke cometh from the north. We may understand Smoke to mean
   Fire, so that the sign will denote the thing signified; for the smoke
   appears before the fire burns. By the north we may understand the
   Assyrians as well as the Jews, for both of them lay to the north with
   respect to the land of the Philistines. Yet I prefer to interpret it as
   referring to the Jews themselves, though I would not argue against the
   opposite exposition. The Philistines thought, as we have already said,
   that they were gainers by what the Jews suffered, as, for instance,
   when they sustained any defeat from the Assyrians; but they at length
   found that they suffered along with the Jews in such a defeat.
   Something of this kind happened, not long ago, to many nations who had
   taken great delight in seeing their enemies vanquished by the Turk:
   they found that such victories were destructive and mournful to
   themselves; for, after the defeat of those whom they wished to see
   destroyed, the road to themselves was likewise thrown open, and they
   also were defeated.

   And no one shall be alone on his appointed day. [233] When he adds,
   that at that time no one shall be solitary, [234] this relates to the
   enemies; and he says, that on an appointed day, that is, when God shall
   have determined to ruin the land of the Philistines, the enemies shall
   be endued with such power and authority, that no one will remain
   unemployed at home, but all will be ready for battle; as if one who
   intended to applaud the authority of some prince should say that his
   subjects, if he but lift up his finger, assemble and give their
   attendance.

   32. And what shall be answered to the messengers of the nation? I
   choose to interpret this of any nations whatever, and not of a single
   nation; for strangers, as soon as they enter into any city, are wont to
   ask what is done, that they may hear some news. It is as if he had
   said, "What shall be answered to strangers when they shall inquire? And
   what report shall be spread when the Philistines shall have been
   vanquished?"

   That the Lord hath founded Zion. By this he means that the destruction
   of the land of the Philistines will be a signal proof of God's
   compassion towards his people, that all may understand that the Lord is
   the guardian and protector of Judea, which he had chosen to be his own.
   The foundation is nothing else than God's gracious adoption, by which
   he promised to Abraham (Genesis 17:7) and his posterity that he would
   be a God to them; and next, when he determined that a temple should be
   built on Zion, (2 Chronicles 3:1; Psalm 65:1, 84:7,) that the
   remembrance of his name might there be preserved. That foundation does
   not consist of lime or stones, but of the gracious promises of eternal
   life, by which his grace was always known to all the godly. The Prophet
   therefore shows that this destruction of the Philistines will be a
   signal proof, by means of which the most distant nations will learn
   that God preserves and guards his people whom he hath chosen.

   And the poor of his people will have confidence in it. [235] He does
   not mean that the hope of believers will be placed in Zion, as when we
   say that we ought to hope in God, but that the inhabitants of Zion
   shall dwell in a safe and quiet place, as the prophets often teach, in
   other passages, that salvation is in Zion. (Joel 2:32.) Isaiah,
   therefore, does not mean that the confidence of the godly is placed in
   the Church, but he shows that the godly are preserved in it, because
   the Lord defends it.

   Yet the Lord intends to make trial of our faith, that we may not think
   that we are in every respect happy; and therefore he calls them poor,
   that we may not think that we are exempted from ordinary calamities,
   though we are under God's protection. Can any higher consolation be
   brought to us, than to learn that the inhabitants of the Church of God,
   though they are liable to a great variety of afflictions, are out of
   all danger? Let us therefore apply that consolation to our calamities,
   and not faint through impatience, when we are informed that God takes
   care of us, and when we absolutely know that we are in safety.

   Isaiah Chapter 15:1-9

   1. The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste,
   and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste,
   and brought to silence:

   1. Onus Moab. Quoniam in nocte vastata est Ar-Moab, in silentium
   redacta est; certe in nocte vastata est Kir-Moab, in silentium redacta.

   2. He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep:
   Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be
   baldness, and every beard cut off.

   2. Ascendet in domum, et Dibon ad excelsa, ad fletum super Nebo, et
   super Medba Moab, ululabit. Super omne caput ejus calvitium, et omnis
   barba detonsa.

   3. In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the
   tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl,
   weeping abundantly.

   3. In compitis ejus accincti erunt sacco; super tecta ejus et in vicis
   ejus omnis ululabit, descendet ad fletum.

   4. And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh; their voice shall be heard even
   unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his
   life shall be grievous unto him.

   4. Vociferabitur Hesbon et Eleale; usque ad Iahaz audietur vox eorum;
   propterea expediti Moab ululabunt; anima cujusque ululabit sibi.

   5. My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar,
   an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with
   weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall
   raise up a cry of destruction.

   5. Cor meum propter Moab vociferabitur; fugitivi ejus ad Zoar, vitulam
   triennem per ascensum Luhith cum fletu ascendent: per viam Horonaim
   clamorem contritionis excitabunt.

   6. For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered
   away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.

   6. Aquae Nimrim exinanitae sunt; aruit gramen, defecit herba, olus non
   superfuit.

   7. Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have
   laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.

   7. Itaque quod residuum quisque fecit, et opes suas deferent ad
   torrentem salicum, (vel, Arabes.)

   8. For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling
   thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.

   8. Circuivit clamor terminos Moab, usque in Eglaim ulutatus ejus, et
   usque in Beer-Elim ululatus ejus.

   9. For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring
   more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the
   remnant of the land.

   9. Quia aquae Dimon implebuntur sanguine; quoniam ponam super Dimon
   additiones iis qui evaserint de Moab leones, et reliquiis terrae.


   1. The burden of Moab. Here the Prophet prophesies against the
   Moabites, who were neighbors to the Jews and related to them by blood;
   for we know that the Moabites were descended from Lot, who was
   Abraham's nephew. (Genesis 11:31, 19:37.) Those nations being so
   closely related, humanity at least demanded that they should maintain
   some friendly intercourse with each other. But no relationship
   prevented the Moabites from cherishing hostility towards the Jews, or
   even from harassing them whenever it was in their power; which is an
   evidence of a savage and barbarous disposition. To them also, on
   account of their cruelty towards the people of God, to whom they ought
   to have conducted themselves with brotherly love, the Prophet therefore
   threatens destruction.

   We ought to remember the design of these predictions. It cannot be
   believed that they were of any advantage to the Moabites, even though
   they had heard from the mouth of the Prophet himself the words which we
   read; but he neither addressed them with his voice, nor sent to them a
   written communication. It was therefore to believers, rather than to
   them, that the Prophet looked, and for two reasons. The first reason
   was, that when they saw so many changes taking place, cities
   overturned, kingdoms destroyed and succeeding one another, they might
   not think that this world is governed by the blind violence of fortune,
   but might acknowledge the providence of God. If nothing had been
   foretold, the minds of men, having a strong tendency to foolishness,
   and being strangely blind to the works of God, might have been disposed
   to attribute all this to chance; but when they had been forewarned by
   the Prophets, they beheld the judgments of God as from a lofty
   watch-tower. To us also in the present day Isaiah has, as it were,
   pointed out with the finger what was then hidden. In his predictions we
   behold God sitting on his judgment-seat, and regulating everything
   according to his pleasure; and although the wicked in various ways
   vented their mad rage, still the Lord made use of their agency to
   execute his judgments. The second design which the prophets had in view
   was, that while the whole world was shaken, the Jews might know that
   God took care of their safety, and that he testified the warmth of his
   affection for the Church, by taking vengeance on her enemies by whom
   she had been barbarously treated.

   Ar-Moab. The Hebrew word r (Ar) means a city; as qyr (kir) means a
   wall; but as r mv'v (Ar-Moab) was one of the chief cities of the
   Moabites, it is supposed to be here a proper name. We might indeed
   explain both words as appellatives, to convey a threatening of the
   overthrow of the fortified towns of which the Moabites are proud; but I
   rather adopt the ordinary interpretation. Here therefore Isaiah has
   given a description, that we may behold in it the overthrow of the
   Moabites, when their chief cities are destroyed.

   In the night. By the night he means a sudden and unexpected occurrence,
   which the Moabites did not dread. Night being appropriated to rest, if
   anything happen at that time, it is viewed as sudden and unlooked for,
   and therefore excites violent alarm. Besides, he intended to rebuke the
   Moabites for being free from anxiety, considering themselves to be
   fortified by defences on every hand, and placed beyond the reach of all
   danger.

   Is brought to silence. That is, is destroyed, and hence also Silence
   sometimes means Death. Others disregard the metaphor, and choose to
   render it, She is cut off; but I leave that point undecided. What
   Isaiah declares as to the Moabites, Scripture pronounces as to the
   reprobate, that destruction is at hand, and, when they are looking for
   nothing of that kind, will fearfully overwhelm them. (Jeremiah 23:19; 1
   Thessalonians 5:2, 3.)

   2. He shall go up into the house. [236] So far as relates to the words,
   some pass by the Hebrew noun vyt, (baith;) but as it signifies a house
   and a temple, it is probable that it was the word commonly used for a
   temple, as in many other passages the house of God means the temple
   [237] (Exodus 23:19, 34:26; Deuteronomy 23:18; Joshua 9:23.) By
   representing the Moabites as bowing down before their idols, he at the
   same time condemns their superstition in worshipping their idol
   Chemosh, as may easily be inferred from 1 Kings 11:7, Jeremiah 48:7,
   13. "The Moabites," says Isaiah, "shall betake themselves to their god
   when matters are so desperate, but to no purpose; for they shall find
   in him no assistance."

   And to Dibon to the high places. This makes it still more evident that
   he is speaking of the Temple; and it is beyond a doubt that the
   Moabites had a fortress remarkable and celebrated above the rest, in
   which they had built high places in honor of their idol. Being ignorant
   of the true God, to whom they might betake themselves in adversity, we
   need not wonder that they betake themselves to an idol, in conformity
   to their ordinary custom. By doing this they increased their misery,
   and brought upon themselves an accumulation of all distresses; for they
   inflamed the wrath of God still more by those very means which they
   considered to be fitted for appeasing his wrath. He therefore wished to
   state more plainly the condition of the ungodly, who have no refuge in
   adversity; for as to those remedies which they think will be adapted to
   their diseases, nothing can be more destructive to them, since they
   excite more and more the Lord's indignation.

   Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Medeba. Nebo also was one of the
   cities of the Moabites. The Prophet has already named two of them, Ar
   and Kir; he now adds a third, Nebo; and lastly he mentions a fourth,
   Medeba; as if he had said that this destruction would not only seize
   the extremities of that country, but would reach its inmost recesses,
   so that not one corner could be exempted.

   On every head. Every nation has its peculiar ceremonies to denote
   mourning or joy. The Italians and other western nations allowed the
   hair and beard to grow when they were in mourning; and hence arose the
   phrase, to lengthen the beard. On the other hand, the eastern nations
   shaved the head and beard, which they reckoned to be ornamental; and
   when they reversed their ordinary custom, that was a token of mourning.
   [238] Nothing else therefore is meant than that the condition of the
   whole kingdom will be so mournful, that the indications of mirth will
   be laid aside, and all will wear the tokens of grief and lamentation.

   3. In his streets. [239] He proceeds with the same subject, describing
   more fully the tokens of mourning, in which the eastern nations abound
   more than others; for, having quicker understandings and keener
   feelings, they express their emotions by outward signs more than others
   do, who, being slower in apprehension, are likewise slower in movement
   and gesture. It was no doubt faulty in them that they indulged in so
   many ceremonies and gesticulations; but the Prophet spoke of them as
   what was known and common, only for the purpose of describing the grief
   which would follow the desolation of that country.

   Every one shall howl and descend to weeping. [240] It was with good
   reason that he added this description; for we are never moved by
   predictions, unless the Lord place them, as it were, before our eyes.
   Lest the Jews should think that these matters might be lightly passed
   by, when he described that destruction, he determined to mention also
   mourning, weeping, and howling, that they might see almost with their
   own eyes those events which appear to be incredible, for the Moabites
   were at that time in a state of profound peace, and believers had the
   more need of being confirmed, that they might not call this prophecy in
   question. By the same means he points out the despair to which
   unbelievers are liable in adversity, for the support on which they rely
   is insecure.

   4. And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh. Here he names other cities; for
   his design is to bind up, as it were, in a bundle all the cities of
   that country, that they may be involved in the general destruction; as
   if he had said, that none at all shall be exempted.

   Therefore the light-armed soldiers of Moab shall howl. Though l kn
   (gnal ken) literally signifies therefore, yet some think that a reason
   is not here assigned; but that is of little importance. The Prophet
   shows that there will be none that does not howl; for he declares that
   the bold and courageous shall mourn. Next he adds, the soul of every
   one shall howl to him. [241] Every one shall be so engrossed with his
   own grief, that he will not think of his neighbors.

   5. My heart shall cry out for Moab. At length he assumes the character
   of a mourner. But it may be thought to be strange and inconsistent in
   him to bewail the calamity of the Moabites; for he ought rather to have
   lamented the destruction of the Church, and to have rejoiced at the
   ruin of her enemies. It is customary with the prophets, however, to
   assume in this manner the character of those whose calamities they
   foretell, and thus to exhibit their condition, as it were, on a stage;
   by which means they produce a stronger impression than if they
   delivered their instruction in a direct form. Yet there can be no doubt
   that the prophets shuddered at the judgments of God, even against the
   wicked; though the meaning which I have stated is simpler and more
   appropriate, and may easily be inferred from frequent usage.

   His fugitives to Zoar, [242] a heifer of three years old. He calls them
   fugitives who shall escape from it; for he means that those who shall
   escape from Moab will come even to Zoar [243] Now, he compares Zoar to
   a heifer of three years old, which is in full vigor, and has not felt
   the pangs of birth, or toil, or the yoke, but revels in the buoyancy of
   mirth and wantonness. When men are hard pressed by an invading army,
   they flee to cities which have not been attacked, and which appear to
   be the farthest removed from danger. Such was Zoar, for it had never
   been attacked by enemies. Yet, if it be thought better to view it as
   applying to the whole country, I have no objection; for Jeremiah
   appears to speak in general terms, though he borrows many statements
   from Isaiah. (Jeremiah 48:34.) But perhaps in that passage also he
   names both Zoar and Horonaim, or rather the whole of the country
   between them.

   If you extend it to the whole nation, the meaning will be, "The
   Moabites have enjoyed the highest luxury, and every kind of abundance,
   and hitherto have suffered no distress. Hence has arisen their
   stubbornness, and, in order to subdue them, they must be banished and
   driven even to Zoar." Now Zoar was a town very far removed from the
   Moabites; and, therefore, he means that they cannot provide for their
   safety but by fleeing to a distance. Here all with whom the Lord deals
   tenderly are taught not to exalt themselves, or to provoke God by their
   wantonness, but to be modest even amidst the highest prosperity, and
   likewise to be prepared for every change, when the Lord shall be
   pleased to throw them down from their prosperity.

   By the going up of Luhith. He describes other parts of the country of
   Moab, and delineates the flight and mourning of that nature which
   should spread throughout the whole land.

   By the way of Horonaim they shall raise the cry of sorrow. The words
   which we have translated, they shall raise up a cry, some render, they
   shall bruise or break themselves by crying, and think there is a
   transposition of the letters, and that (ain) is doubled; and thus the
   root of the verb would be rh, (ragnah.) But as it made little
   difference in the meaning of the passage, I have adhered to the
   commonly received opinion, that yrv (yegnogneru) is derived from the
   verb vr, (gnur.) If it be thought better to make the verb signify
   break, the meaning will be, "There shall be a shaking, and, as it were,
   a breaking of the members of the body, when arm is dashed against arm."

   6. The waters of Nimrim. By an exaggerated form of expression he gives
   a more enlarged view of this desolation. He says that the grass is
   withered, which takes place when God leaves any soil destitute of all
   nourishment. The waters will be taken away, which probably were highly
   necessary for that dry and parched country; for soils of that kind
   produce nothing without irrigation. Though the style is exaggerated,
   yet nothing is stated but what is strictly true; for the Prophet did
   not go beyond proper bounds, but found it necessary to use bold
   expressions to suit the ignorance of the people, in order to inform
   them that a land which is deprived of the blessing of God will be like
   a desert without any beauty.

   7. Therefore what every one hath left. [244] This corresponds to the
   ordinary expression, (Ce qu'il aura espargne,) Whatever he shall have
   spared. He means the riches that are laid up, and describes what
   usually happens in countries which are invaded by an enemy. All the
   inhabitants are wont to convey their riches elsewhere, and to lay them
   up in some safe place, that they may afterwards bring them back when
   peace has been restored.

   To the brook of the willows. He means that they will have no
   storehouse, no fortress in which they can lay them up with safety; so
   that they will be compelled to hide them among the willows. This
   certainly is the lowest wretchedness, when the enemy is attacking us,
   and we can find no storehouse for laying up those things which we have
   collected with great industry. These willows were probably situated in
   some remote and sequestered place. Others explain it as referring to
   enemies, that they will bring the fruits of their robbery to the brook,
   to divide among themselves the general plunder.

   8. The cry is gone round about the borders of Moab. [245] ky, (ki,)
   for, is added for the sake of ornament. He means that every part of
   that country all around shall be full of crying and howling; because
   that destruction reaches from one extremity to another. Besides the
   crying he twice mentions the howling, to denote the excess of grief, as
   men who are in despair surrender themselves entirely to lamentation.

   9. For the waters of Dimon shall be filled with blood. [246] Here he
   describes not only grief and howling, flight or trembling, or the
   covetousness of enemies in plundering their wealth, but the slaughter
   of men. How great must this have been, when large and magnificent
   rivers, such as Dimon was, are filled with blood!

   For I will lay upon Dimon additions. [247] By additions he means that
   the Lord, in whose name he speaks, will multiply the murders; so that
   the dead bodies shall be heaped up, and there shall be no end to
   cruelty and slaying. Now, though the Assyrians were cruel in this
   slaughter, yet the Lord was not cruel; for he justly punished the
   barbarity of the Moabites which they basely exercised towards the Jews,
   on whom they ought to have had compassion. It was right that they
   should suffer the same punishment which they had inflicted on others.

   To those who have escaped of Moab lions. These also are the additions
   of which he spake, or, at least, a part of them. This may be regarded
   as the copestone of that calamity; so that if any detachments of the
   enemy attempted to escape, and to rescue themselves from the slaughter,
   they had to encounter lions [248] and wild beasts, by which they were
   devoured. "They will, indeed," says he, "rescue themselves from the
   slaughter, but they will not on that account be safe, nor will they
   escape the hand of God." And this is the true meaning of the Prophet,
   if we carefully examine the scope of the whole passage; for he intended
   to deepen the picture of that distressing calamity by adding, that even
   the small remnant which shall be rescued from the slaughter will fall
   into the jaws of lions. The hand of the Lord pursues the wicked in such
   a manner that they cannot in any way escape; for if they avoid one
   danger, they immediately meet with another. Let us remember that these
   things are spoken by the Prophet for the consolation of the godly, that
   they may fortify their minds by some promise against the cruelty of
   their enemies, who shall at length be destroyed, and shall nowhere find
   a refuge either in their gods, or in fortresses, or in lurking-places,
   or in flight.

   Isaiah Chapter 16:1-14

   1. Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
   wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

   1. Mittite agnum dominatori terrae de petra deserti ad montem filiae
   Sion.

   2. For it shall be, that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so
   the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

   2. Erit autem sicut avis emissa, recedens e nido: ita erunt filiae Moab
   ad transitus Arnon.

   3. Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the
   midst of the noon-day; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that
   wandereth.

   3. Cogite consilium, facite judicium; pone sicut noctem umbram tuam in
   medio meridiei; absconde expulsos, profugum ne prodas.

   4. Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them
   from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the
   spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.

   4. Peregrinentur apud te ejecti mei. Moab, sis illis latibulum a facie
   vastatoris; quoniam cessavit emunctor, finitus est vastator, consumptus
   est conculcator e terra.

   5. And in mercy shall the throne be established; and he shall sit upon
   it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment,
   and hasting righteousness.

   5. Et praeparabitur in misericordia solium, sedebitque super ipsum in
   firmitate, in tabernaculo David qui judicet, et quaerat judicium, et
   acceleret justitiam.

   6. We have heard of the pride of Moab, (he is very proud,) even of his
   haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies shall not be
   so.

   6. Audivimus superbiam Moab (superbus est valde) superbiam ejus, et
   arrogantiam ejus, et insolentiam (vel, indignationem) ejus. Sed non
   rata erunt mendacia ejus.

   7. Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the
   foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.

   7. Propterea ululabit Moab ad Moab, totus ululabit, propter fundamenta
   Kir-hareseth; gemetis tantum percussi.

   8. For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the
   lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof;
   they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness:
   her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea:

   8. Quoniam vites Hesbon excisae sunt, vitis Sibma. Domini gentium
   conculcarunt eximias ejus propagines (vel, palmites) quae usque ad
   Iazer pervenerant; erraverant usque ad desertum, nobiles ejus plantae
   prostratae sunt, quae transibant mare.

   9. Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
   Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh; for
   the shouting for thy summer-fruits, and for thy harvest, is fallen.

   9. Propterea flebo in fletu Iazer vitis Sibma; inebriabo te lachrymis
   meis Hesbon et Eleale; quoniam super collectionem tuam, et super messem
   tuam irruet (vel, cadet) canticum.

   10. And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and
   in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be
   shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have
   made their vintage-shouting to cease.

   10. Sublatum est gaudium et exultatio ab agro fertili; in vineis non
   exultabitur, nec jubilabitur. Vinum in torcularibus non calcabit
   calcator, canticum quiescere feci.

   11. Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine
   inward parts for Kir-haresh.

   11. Propterea viscera mea super Moab quasi cithara sonabunt, et
   interiora mea super Kir-hareseth.

   12. And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on
   the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he
   shall not prevail.

   12. Et erit cum apparuerit fatigatum esse Moab super excelsa, tunc
   veniet ad sanctuarium precandi causa; nec proficiet.

   13. This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning Moab since
   that time.

   13. Hoc est verbum quod protulit Iehova super Moab ab hoc tempore.

   14. But now the Lord hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the
   years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with
   all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and
   feeble.

   14. Nunc, inquam, locutus est Iehova, dicens, Tres anni, quasi anni
   mercenarii; et tunc in ignominiam vertetur gloria Moab, in tota
   multitudine ejus, quamvis multa; et reliquiae ejus paucae, exiguae, et
   invalidae.


   1. Send ye a lamb. Here the Prophet scoffs at the Moabites for not
   acknowledging God at the proper time, but recklessly waiting for the
   stroke of his hand, till they were completely destroyed. It is,
   therefore, a condemnation of late repentance, when men cannot be
   brought to obedience by any warnings, and continue in obstinate
   opposition to God. Where the disease is incurable, an exhortation of
   this kind is appropriate; and this ought to be carefully observed, for
   both Jews and Christians misinterpret this passage.

   Jerome explains it as referring to Christ, because he drew his birth
   from the Moabites, (Ruth 1:4; Matthew 1:5,) from whom Ruth was
   descended; and that opinion has been adopted by almost all Christians;
   as if the Prophet had said, "O Lord, though a judgment so severe as
   this awaits the Moabites, still thou wilt not utterly destroy them; for
   they will send thee a Lamb, the ruler of the world." But that
   interpretation, being destitute of plausibility, need not be refuted.

   On the other hand, the Jews think that these words were spoken because,
   while the Jews were in a depressed condition, the Moabites ceased to
   pay the tribute which they owed them, but that, after having prophesied
   about the restoration of the kingdom of Judah, Isaiah likewise added an
   exhortation to remind them to acknowledge their king. They even go so
   far as to say that it serves the purpose of a royal edict, taking them
   to task for their disloyalty, "Send the tribute which you owe." But we
   nowhere read that the Moabites were subjects or tributaries to the
   Jews, and there is no probability in the conjecture. Nor does the
   passage which they quote (2 Kings 3:5, 6) give them any support; for
   that passage relates to the king of Israel, and expressly mentions Ahab
   and Samaria, who cherished, as we are aware, the utmost hatred against
   the Jews.

   I therefore adhere to the interpretation which I first noticed, as the
   true and natural interpretation; for the design of the Prophet is to
   condemn the Moabites for not having repented in due season, and to tell
   them that they will now in vain do what they might easily have done
   formerly, and with great advantage to themselves. We ought, therefore,
   to view it as spoken ironically, (eironikos,) Send; as if he had said
   that there is no hope of pardon, that they will send in vain. When the
   wicked are warned, they indolently disregard all exhortation; when they
   are punished, they gaze around them with distressful looks, seeking
   assistance in every direction, and trying every method of relief, but
   unsuccessfully, for they gain no advantage. Isaiah, therefore,
   reproaches them for obstinacy and rebellion, and shows that there will
   be no time for repentance, when they meet with the destruction which
   they deserve.

   To the ruler of the world. The opinion of the Jews, that this denotes
   Hezekiah, is at variance with all reason; for 'rts (eretz) does not
   here denote a particular country, but rather the whole world, of which
   he speaks in general terms. The appellation Ruler must therefore be
   viewed as referring to God himself. By a lamb, he means what was to be
   offered in sacrifice; for even the Gentiles acknowledged that they
   worshipped God when they offered sacrifices.

   From the rock [249] of the desert. He gives the name of the rock of the
   desert to the city, which is supposed to have been the chief city of
   the Moabites; [250] though it is possible that he intended to include
   the whole of the country, and thus a part will be taken for the whole.

   To the mountain of the daughter of Zion; that is, to God's authorized
   temple, in which sacrifices were offered according to the injunction of
   the Law. (Deuteronomy 12:5, 6, 7; 2 Chronicles 7:12.) This is a
   remarkable passage against obstinate men, who set aside all
   instruction, and fearlessly despise God, till they are visited by his
   judgments.

   2. It shall be as a bird let loose. [251] The Prophet now shows what he
   meant by the former mockery, that the Moabites ought not at that time
   to think of sending sacrifices, because they will not be able to
   provide for their safety in any other way than by leaving their native
   country. By the metaphor of birds he describes the terror with which
   they shall be struck, so that they will flee even at the rustling of a
   leaf. He threatens that the Moabites, who had abused their
   tranquillity, shall have a trembling and wearisome flight.

   3. Assemble a council. [252] He proceeds with the same subject; for if
   we wish rightly to understand this passage, we must set before our
   minds the dreadful ruin of the Moabites. Their crimes are brought to
   remembrance, that all may see more clearly how deservedly they are
   punished. When everything was in their power, they freely indulged in
   licentiousness, and would not listen to any reproofs; but now, when
   they are deprived of everything, they groan, and seek remedies which
   are nowhere to be found. The Lord deals with the reprobate in such a
   manner that, in order to leave them without excuse, he bestows upon
   them, and places in their hands, everything that they need; but when,
   through their wicked passion, they have abused and turned everything to
   a wicked purpose, he deprives them of all aid and support, and utterly
   destroys them.

   Execute judgment. While the Moabites enjoyed prosperity, they cared
   little about what was good and right; while it was in their power to
   rule, and to have their kingdom established, in a just manner, they
   abused their power for the purpose of tyranny. Now that they were
   stripped of all authority, and were exiles and fugitives, Isaiah
   ironically advises them to assemble councils and execute judgments,
   which they had formerly overturned through fraud and injustice. Isaiah
   has in view that time when all power and authority was taken out of the
   hands of the Moabites. The upbraiding is similar to that with which the
   Lord addresses Adam, (Genesis 3:22,) Behold, Adam is become as one of
   us, ridiculing him with the biting taunt, that he was not satisfied
   with his exalted attainments, and wished to rival God himself.

   In like manner, the Moabites, not satisfied with their ornaments and
   wealth, wretchedly harassed and plundered the Israelites and Jews, and
   formed wicked plans against them. Having abused the excellent gift of
   God, they therefore deserved to have this reproof addressed to them,
   which is equally applicable to all the reprobate, who proudly vaunt in
   prosperity and barbarously abuse it for harassing the godly. Seeing
   that they basely pollute those things which the Lord had set apart to
   their proper use, it is right that they should be deprived of them and
   reduced to the lowest poverty. We have instances of this every day. How
   comes it that those who were raised to the highest rank of honor fall
   down headlong, but because the Lord punishes their tyrannical rule and
   their crimes? The Lord also ridicules their upbraiding and reproachful
   language, their wailings, and even their complaints; as when they
   exclaim, "O that I had the wealth which I once enjoyed! O that I were
   restored to my former condition!" For then repentance will be too late.

   Make thy shadow. The Moabites might, as I have already hinted, have
   given some relief to the wretched Jews, when they were harassed by the
   Assyrians; or, at least, if they had had a spark of humanity, they
   ought to have protected the fugitives; but, on the contrary, they
   persecuted them, and added to the weight of their afflictions, which
   were already oppressive. It was highly proper that the Moabites should
   be the subjects of that cruelty which they had exercised towards
   others; that, when they had been driven from their dwellings, and were
   exiles and wanderers, they should nowhere find any solace, any shadow
   to shelter them from the heat; for why should they enjoy the
   consolations which they had barbarously refused to others?

   As the night in the midst of noon-day. [253] By noon-day is here meant
   the most scorching heat. This metaphor is frequently employed in
   Scripture, that the Lord was like a cloud at noon, and like a pillar of
   fire by night; for he once was so in the wilderness. (Exodus 13:21, 22;
   Numbers 14:14; Deuteronomy 1:33.) This mode of expression, being
   customary, was retained by the Prophets, though they did not relate the
   history.

   Hide the banished. He means the Jews, whom the Assyrians persecuted and
   harassed, and whom the Moabites at the same time treated cruelly. It
   was their duty to shelter and relieve the fugitives, and especially
   those who fled to them for protection; but seeing that they drove them
   out, it was proper that they should be driven out in the same manner,
   and deprived of all assistance and support; for it is a righteous
   sentence which the Lord pronounces, when he enjoins that the same
   measure which every one metes shall be measured to him again.
   (Deuteronomy 19:19, 21; Matthew 7:2.) Now the Prophet calls on the
   Moabites to acknowledge their sins, so as to confess that they are
   justly punished for their cruelty. Yet he rather has the Jews in his
   eye, in order to inform them that God does not disregard their
   afflictions, for they are told that he will be their avenger.

   4. Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab. The Prophet addresses the
   Moabites, as if he were humbly beseeching them in the name of the
   people at large. "You are neighbors, related to us by blood; receive
   and assist those who are in distress: and if you do not choose to
   assist, at least do them no harm." God, who usually undertakes the
   cause of his people, is represented by the Prophet as if he performed
   the part of a suppliant. It is certain, that the Moabites did not at
   all act in this manner towards the Jews, but, on the contrary, that
   they joined their efforts with the enemies of the Jews to do them
   injury. But, as I said a little before, the Prophet sets before our
   eyes that justice which even nature demands, that the cruel violation
   of it may be the more abhorred.

   This passage ought to be carefully observed; for God shows how great is
   the care which he takes of his people, since the injuries done to them
   affect him in the same manner as if they had been done to himself; as
   he declares by Zechariah, that whenever they are touched, the apple of
   his eye is touched. (Zechariah 2:8.) He hears the groaning, (Psalm
   102:20,) and observes the tears, of wretched men who call upon him;
   (Psalm 12:5, 38:9;) and though this be not always visible to us, yet in
   due season he shows that he has heard them.

   Let us therefore learn from this passage to be kind and dutiful to
   fugitives and exiles, and especially to believers, who are banished for
   their confession of the word. No duty can be more pleasing or
   acceptable to God; and, on the other hand, nothing is more hateful or
   abominable in his sight than barbarity and cruelty. If we wish to
   obtain any alleviation of our calamities, let us be kind and
   compassionate, and not refuse assistance to the needy.

   Blessed, says he, is he that judgeth wisely about the poor and needy;
   the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.
   (Psalm 41:1.)

   On the other hand,

   he shall have judgment without mercy who hath showed no mercy. (James
   2:13.)

   When God calls them his banished, this may without impropriety be
   viewed as referring to punishment, as if he said, that by a just
   judgment they were banished from the land of Canaan, (Deuteronomy
   28:64,) as he had so often threatened against them. Yet undoubtedly he
   likewise means, that they continue to be under his defense and
   protection, because, though they are banished and driven out of their
   native country, still he acknowledges them to be his people. That
   calamity which the Jews endured might be regarded as an evidence that
   they were cast off; but the Lord acknowledges them to be his children,
   though he chastises them severely. Hence we obtain a doctrine full of
   consolation, that we are reckoned in the number of his children, though
   sharp and heavy strokes are inflicted upon us.

   For the extortioner hath ceased. [254] He now directs his discourse to
   the Jews, and proceeds to comfort them, as he had done formerly, by
   showing that, when their enemies shall be removed from the midst of
   them, the banishment or ruin of their enemies will also relieve their
   own calamities and distresses. Yet the former statements related
   chiefly to the Jews, though the Prophet expressly addressed the
   Moabites. But at that time he only threatened vengeance on enemies,
   while here he more clearly promises consolation to his people; as if he
   had said, "Thou thoughtest, O Moab, that my people were utterly ruined:
   but I will restrain the enemies, and put an end to that affliction.
   Thou shalt therefore perish; but my people shall at length be delivered
   from those dreadful calamities."

   Perhaps it will rather be thought that there is a change of the tenses;
   and thus the particle ky, (ki,) which we have rendered For, will
   signify Until; [255] and this clause will be read in immediate
   connection with the former part of the sentence. Let my banished dwell
   with thee, Moab; be thou a place of concealment from the face of the
   destroyer, until the extortioner shall have ceased. But as that might
   be thought to be a forced interpretation, I have chosen to abide by the
   natural meaning.

   5. And the throne shall be prepared in mercy. [256] The Jews explain
   the whole of this verse as referring to Hezekiah; but this is
   altogether inappropriate, for the Prophet speaks of a more important
   restoration of the Church, and the Moabites had not been punished
   during the flourishing condition of Hezekiah's reign; and the blessing
   of God again began to burst forth on the Jews. It is as if it had been
   said "All the enemies of the chosen people maliciously contrive the
   ruin of that kingdom, which God promised should be established for
   ever." (2 Samuel 7:13.) That the godly may not give way to despondency
   amidst the unhappy confusion, they are reminded of the perpetuity of
   the kingdom, of which they had been assured by a well-known prediction.

   It cannot therefore be explained as referring to any other than to
   Christ, though I acknowledge that Hezekiah was a type of Christ, as
   David and the rest of his successors also were. But they conduct us to
   Christ, who alone is the protector and leader of his people, (John
   10:16,) and who has gathered the remnant that was scattered abroad.
   (John 11:52.) For this reason he sends back the godly to Christ, as if
   he had said, "You know what God you worship. He has declared that he
   will watch over your safety, so that under his protection you will
   always continue to be safe and uninjured; and if you shall at any time
   meet with reverses, he has promised to you a Redeemer, under whom you
   shall enjoy renewed and steadfast prosperity. Though for a time you may
   weep, yet the protector of the Church will come, and will restore you
   to a flourishing state of freedom. You ought, therefore, with your
   whole heart, to rely on the expectation of him; even when you see the
   Church to be in a confused and wretched condition."

   This ought to be carefully observed; for all other consolations are
   transitory and fading, if we do not refer all of them to Christ. Let
   our eyes therefore be fixed on him, if we wish to be happy and
   prosperous; for he has promised that we shall be happy even amidst the
   cross, (Matthew 5:10,11,) that agony and torments will open up the way
   to a blessed life, (2 Corinthians 4:17,) and that all the afflictions
   which we shall suffer will add to the amount of our happiness. (Romans
   8:28.)

   In mercy. Isaiah shows that this does not take place through the agency
   of men, but by the kindness of God, who is the builder of this throne;
   and therefore we ought to acknowledge that it is owing to his
   undeserved goodness that this sacred throne is established among us.
   The Prophet expressly confirms this by saying, that the cause of it
   must not be sought anywhere else than in the absolute mercy of God. Nor
   can any other cause be found; for God could not be induced by any
   excellence of character, or by merits, (of which there certainly were
   none,) to set up again the throne which had fallen down through the
   fault and through the crimes of the people; but when he saw that those
   whom he had adopted were ruined, he wished to give a proof of his
   infinite goodness. Now, if God build this throne, by whom shall it be
   overturned? Will wicked men be stronger than he?

   And he will sit upon it in the tabernacle of David. Almost every word
   here is emphatic, so that this verse deserves to be continually
   pondered. I do not object to the opinion that the word tabernacle
   contains an allusion to this effect, that he was but an ordinary man
   before he was called to sit on a throne. (1 Samuel 16:11, 12; 2 Samuel
   7:8.) The Prophet intended to draw a picture of the Church, which has
   no resemblance to the thrones of kings and of princes, and does not
   shine with gold or precious stones. Though he has held out the
   spiritual kingdom of Christ under a mean and despicable shape, yet at
   the same time he shows that that kingdom will be seen on earth and
   amongst men. If he had only said that the throne of Christ will be
   erected, we might have asked, Will his throne be in heaven, or also on
   earth? But now when he says, in the tabernacle of David, he shows that
   Christ reigns not only among angels but also among men, lest we should
   think that, in order to seek him, we must enter into heaven. Wicked men
   ridicule what we preach about the kingdom of Christ, as if it were some
   phantom of our own imagination. They wish to see it with their eyes,
   and to have the evidence of their senses; but we ought not to conceive
   of it as at all carnal, but to be satisfied with his arm and with his
   power.

   In steadfastness. 'mt (emeth) denotes not only truth but every kind of
   certainty. The Prophet means that the kingdom of Christ will be firm
   and steadfast, as Daniel also declared. (Daniel 2:44, 7:14.) The
   Evangelist also says, Of his kingdom there shall be no end. (Luke
   1:33.) In this respect it is distinguished from the ordinary condition
   of kingdoms, which, even when they are founded on great and enormous
   wealth, crumble down or even fall by their own weight, so that they
   have no more permanency than vanishing pictures. But Isaiah declares,
   that the kingdom of Christ, though it frequently totter, will be
   supported by the hand of God, and therefore will last for ever. These
   proofs ought to fortify us against temptations which arise, whenever
   the kingdom of Christ is attacked by enemies so numerous and powerful
   that we might be ready to think that it will quickly be destroyed.
   Whatever weapons the world may employ, and though hell itself should
   vomit out flames of fire, we must abide by this promise.

   Who shall judge. I understand spht (shophet) to mean Governor, as if he
   had said, "There will be one who shall govern." Often do we see a
   magnificent throne when there is no one to sit on it, and it frequently
   happens that kings are either idols or cattle, without judgment or
   skill or wisdom. But here he says, that one will sit who shall
   discharge the office of a good governor; and this is added in order to
   assure us that Christ will be our protector.

   And seek judgment and hasten righteousness. The judgment and the
   righteousness which are ascribed to him, are nothing else than the
   protection under which he receives us, and which he will not allow to
   be infringed; for he will not allow wicked men who injure us to pass
   unpunished, while we patiently and calmly commit ourselves to his
   protection. By the word hasten he shows that he will quickly and
   speedily avenge our cause. This must be viewed as a rebuke to our
   impatience, for we never think that his assistance comes soon enough.
   But when we are hurried along by the violence of passion, let us
   remember that this arises from not submitting to his providence; for
   although according to the judgment of our flesh he delays, still he
   regulates his judgment in the best manner by the seasons which are well
   known to him. Let us therefore submit to his will.

   6. We have heard of the pride of Moab. The Prophet added this statement
   by way of anticipation. It might be thought that men could not believe
   what he had promised about restoring the throne of the king and
   destroying the Moabites, who at that time were in a flourishing state
   of riches, and were defended by strong fortresses, and who, puffed up
   with the prosperity which they now enjoyed, were exceedingly proud.
   Besides, their haughtiness, with which they scorned the unhappy Jews,
   was a disagreeable and powerful weapon for discouraging or shaking
   their minds. To provide against this temptation, he relates that their
   boasting was well known, but that their pride would not prevent God
   from overthrowing them; because no array of armed forces, no treasures
   of riches, no multitude of men, can withstand God. Isaiah speaks of it
   as a thing extensively known, that the Moabites are puffed up in such a
   manner that they dread nothing; as is commonly the case with those who
   are well supplied with riches and troops, that they idly exalt
   themselves above God and men. But whatever may be their arrogance, the
   Lord will easily restrain it.

   His insolence. [257] The Hebrew word vrh (gnebrah) most frequently
   signifies indignation; but the connection in which it stands appears to
   call for something more definite. This noun is derived from the verb
   vr, (gnabar,) to pass or go beyond, answering to the Latin word
   excessus; and therefore I have thought it better to translate it
   insolence. In a parallel passage, after the words pride and arrogance
   comes the phrase haughtiness of heart. (Jeremiah 48:29.) Both Isaiah
   and Jeremiah, I have no doubt, mean that the Moabites, in consequence
   of their stubborn and disdainful behavior, and their sumptuous mode of
   living, were so cruel, that they kindled into wrath on the most trivial
   occasions, and rose fiercely against others. This vice is always
   accompanied by haughtiness of mind; for pride is followed by disdain
   and contempt of others, and they who claim more than is due to them
   easily kindle into rage, and become furious for the smallest offense.
   In short, they can bear nothing, and are not only passionate, but
   likewise outrageous. They would wish that all should yield to them, and
   that they should yield to none. If all do not yield at their bidding,
   they think that injustice is done to them. This passionate temper is
   easily betrayed by proud men. On the other hand, the humble possess
   kindness accompanied by corresponding modesty, and easily forgive any
   one who has injured them.

   His lies. The Hebrew word vdym (baddim) denotes either a mans limbs, or
   the branches of a tree, and sometimes it is put for divination.
   Accordingly, the Greek translators [258] render it manteia, divination,
   and it has that signification in other passages. Some think that it is
   here used metaphorically for children; others translate it either
   discourses or thoughts; and others render it strength or sinews. But in
   my opinion it is rather put for vain boasting; for this word often
   denotes falsehood, and we shall soon see how well this signification
   applies to the present passage.

   There is quite as much difference in the interpretation of the word kn
   (ken,) so. The greater part suppose it to mean that "the lies are not
   right," or that "the discourses are not right," and others, that "the
   lies are not true;" and as to the substance of the matter, I am almost
   of their opinion. I have no doubt that the meaning of the Prophet is,
   that Moab foolishly utters his vain boastings, for he will not
   accomplish what he imagines. As to the words, the meaning of them is
   obtained with greater certainty from Jeremiah 48:30. After the same
   words which are here employed by Isaiah, he immediately adds, for the
   sake of explaining them, l' kn, (lo ken,) Not so; [259] his lies shall
   not so effect it. As if he had said, "What is determined in their
   hearts shall fail of accomplishment." Yet I do not think, that in the
   former clause the particle kn (ken) denotes comparison, but rather
   confirmation, so to speak, but negatively; for he declares that there
   will be no firmness or stability in his counsels, that his divinations
   or lies will not take effect. Proud men settle everything as if
   everything were in their power, and were not subject to the providence
   of God. "Such arrogance," says Isaiah, shall be brought down, and all
   that they promise, as to their own strength, shall vanish away. This
   reminds us that pride is highly displeasing to God, and that the more
   men are puffed up with their riches, they are the nearer to
   destruction.

   7. Therefore shall Moab howl to Moab. [260] He declares more plainly
   what has been already said, that this pride, and the cruelty which
   springs from it, will be the cause of their destruction. Since the Lord
   resisteth the proud, (James 4:6; 1 Peter 5:5,) it is impossible but
   that he will lay low this haughtiness, by which the Church is basely
   and shamefully trampled under foot; and, according to this example, the
   end of all proud men must be mournful. When he adds, Moab to Moab, he
   means that there will be what may be called a melancholy concert among
   them, in which they shall mutually complain of their calamities and
   bewail their distresses among themselves. Others render it, on account
   of Moab, but this is a feeble interpretation; for immediately
   afterwards it follows that the howling will be universal, or that it
   will be throughout the whole of the people.

   On account of the foundations of Kir-hareseth. It is sufficiently
   evident that this was a chief and royal city; but some consider it to
   be a proper name, and others to be an appellative. There can be no
   doubt that the etymology of the word was derived from its being
   constructed of earthen materials. It is also possible that it received
   this name on account of the nature of the walls, which were built of
   bricks. It was a distinguished city in that country. He names the
   foundations rather than the city itself, because it was to be
   completely thrown down; as if he had said, "You shall not mourn the
   plundering of the city or the destruction of the buildings, but its
   entire overthrow; for no part of it shall be left."

   You will groan, being only smitten. [261] Some translate nk'ym
   (nechaim) lame; but I prefer to take it as meaning smitten. The
   particle 'k, (ach,) which is here prefixed to it, sometimes means
   certainly or truly; and sometimes it is put for but or notwithstanding.
   Those who explain it affirmatively suppose the meaning to be this, You
   will groan, being truly smitten; that is, "It will not be necessary for
   you to hire men to pretend mourning in your name, as is usually done in
   funerals, but you will mourn in earnest." But I prefer to take 'k (ach)
   as meaning only; that is, "All who shall be left will be wounded; not
   one shall be safe." By this mode of expression he describes the utter
   destruction of that city, and intimates that those who are left will
   lament not only the distresses of others, but also their own. They,
   too, will be wounded. And if such severe punishments are inflicted on
   the proud, let us learn to submit ourselves with humility and modesty,
   and willingly to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. (1
   Peter 5:6.)

   8. For the vines of Heshbon have been cut down. [262] Here the Prophet
   describes allegorically the desolation of the whole country. There is
   reason to believe that it abounded in the choicest vines, [263] as may
   readily be inferred from this and the parallel passage. (Jeremiah
   48:32.) When Prophets threaten destruction to countries, they usually
   delineate their more remarkable features. For instance, were we to
   speak of Picardy, we certainly would say nothing about vines, as if we
   had been speaking about Orleans or Burgundy. Now, the cities mentioned
   by the Prophet were the chief cities of Moab.

   The lords of the nations have trodden down his choicest shoots or
   branches. [264] The Prophet says that the most valuable branches of
   their vineyards were torn out by the lords of the nations, that is, by
   the conquerors, who, having subdued the nations in war, held extensive
   dominion.

   Which reached even to Jazer. [265] This serves to point out the extent
   of the devastation; for this city was situated on the confines of the
   land of the Moabites; as if he had said, "Not only shall a part of the
   vineyards be cut down, but the whole country shall be wasted far and
   wide." Some refer this to the enemies themselves; but I would rather
   supply the relative 'sr, (asher,) which, and refer it to the vines,
   which were so extensive that they reached even to Jazer. Thus the
   meaning will be, "Though these vineyards reached even to Jazer, and
   covered a very large tract of country, yet thence to the wilderness
   they will all be trodden down by the lords of the nations." This agrees
   best with the scope of the passage; for it is immediately added that
   the vineyards reached to the wilderness, and even to the sea; by which
   he means that the country was exceedingly fertile, and especially that
   it abounded in vines. He says that they crossed the sea, [266] because,
   when the soil is productive, it is customary to protect by mounds what
   is contiguous to the sea, in order to extend the cultivation, and to
   oppose the violence of the waves by posts of wood and embankments, in
   order to obtain a large extent of available soil.

   9. Therefore I will bewail. The Prophet here takes upon him the
   character of another person, as we have formerly remarked; for in the
   name of the Moabites he laments and groans. It is undoubtedly true that
   believers always shudder at the judgments of God, and cannot lay aside
   the feelings of human nature, so as not to commiserate the destruction
   of the wicked. Yet he does not describe his own feelings; but his
   intention is to give additional weight to his instruction, that no one
   may entertain a doubt as to the accomplishment. He therefore represents
   in the person of a Moabite, as on a stage, the mourning and grief which
   shall be felt by all after that calamity, in order to hold out to the
   Jews a confirmation of this promise, which otherwise might have been
   thought to be incredible.

   Because on thy summer-fruits and on thy harvest a shouting shall break
   forth, or shall fall. [267] This last clause of the verse is variously
   explained by commentators. nphl, (naphal,) signifies to fall, or to
   burst forth. Those who translate it, to burst forth, consider the word
   hydd, (hedad,) shouting, to refer to the enemies themselves; as if he
   had said, "The shouting of enemies bursts forth on thy harvest;" so
   that there is an implied contrast between this shouting and the joy of
   which he will afterwards speak. Others explain it to mean, that the
   shoutings will be laid; that is, "there shall be no more shouting, and
   no longer shall the glad and merry voices of the reapers be heard,
   cheering themselves after the harvest." But I would rather refer it to
   the shouting of enemies; and on this point I follow a most faithful
   interpreter of this passage, the Prophet Jeremiah, who says that the
   spoiler bursts forth, (Jeremiah 48:32,) where Isaiah speaks of the
   shouting of the enemy; as if he had said, "When thou shalt make
   preparations for gathering in thy harvest and thy vintage, the enemies
   will rush in, and, instead of joy and cheerful song, their shouting
   shall be heard, which shall drive thee far away."

   10. Joy is taken away. He confirms, by different words, what he has now
   said, that the whole country shall be desolate and forsaken, so that
   there shall never again be in it a harvest or a vintage. When he
   threatens that God will cause the vine-dressers to cease to sing, he
   refers to an ancient custom; for when they gathered the vintage, they
   usually testified their joy both by dancing and by singing. Hence these
   words of Virgil, The exhausted vine-dresser now addresses by song his
   farthest rows [268] In like manner, the sailors, when they approach the
   harbour, raise their shout of joy, (keleusma,) because, having finished
   their toils, and escaped dangers, they see that they have hope of
   obtaining some leisure or refreshment. It is as if the Prophet had
   said, "When the produce of the harvest shall be taken away, nothing
   will be left to them but to lament their poverty."

   11. Therefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab. Assuming the
   character of a Moabite, the Prophet again describes excessive
   lamentation, proceeding from grief so intense that even the bowels make
   a distressing noise; for by the sign he intended to point out the
   reality. We have formerly explained the object of those lively
   descriptions, which is, to bring the events, as it were, before our
   eyes, and to lead us to entertain stronger hopes of those things which
   appear to go beyond all belief. By again naming Kir-Hareseth, the chief
   city, and thus taking a part for the whole, he describes the
   destruction of the whole country.

   12. And it shall be. He again returns to that statement which he
   formerly noticed, namely, that idolaters in their affliction betake
   themselves to their idols, hoping to obtain some relief from them. Yet
   it means somewhat more; for while idolaters have their ordinary temples
   and places of worship, if any uncommon calamity befalls them, they go
   to another temple more sacred than the rest, expecting that there they
   will be more abundantly favored with the presence of their god. In like
   manner, the Papists of the present day, when they are reduced to any
   uncommon danger, (for this fault has existed in all ages,) think that
   they will more readily obtain their wish by running to St. Claude, or
   to Mary of Loretto, or to any other celebrated idol, than if they
   assembled in some neighboring church. They resolve that their
   extraordinary prayers shall be offered up in a church which is at a
   great distance. It is in this sense that the Prophet applies the term
   Sanctuary to that which was most highly celebrated among the Moabites,
   and says that they will go to it, but without any advantage. Now it is
   evident from sacred history that their most celebrated temple was
   dedicated to Chemosh. (1 Kings 11:7.)

   And shall not profit by it. [269] The phrase l' yvkl, (lo yuchal,) they
   shall not be able, is explained by some to mean, that they shall at
   length be so completely worn out that they will not have sufficient
   strength to go to the temple. But I think it better to render it thus,
   he shall not profit by it; for he shuts out the Moabites from all hope
   of safety, by saying that they will find no protection even in their
   gods.

   When it is seen. The word nr'h, (nirah,) seen, is emphatic. It means
   that idolaters are not guided by reason, but rather by the impressions
   made on their senses, like brute beasts: for as the beasts judge by
   feeling, smelling, and seeing, so idolaters have no other guide than
   the judgment of the flesh. Accordingly, if any one shall show that they
   are doing wrong, he will gain nothing by it. Though they have often
   known by experience that they gain nothing by so many laborious
   exertions, they will not desist from them, but will contrive new
   methods and introduce new modes of worship, hoping that God will
   approve of them. If they succeed according to their wish, they ascribe
   everything to their superstitions, and become more obstinate. If they
   perceive that they have derived no advantage, they reject their
   contrivances, condemn the superstitious worship, and curse their gods.
   In short, they rely altogether on the events, and do not judge of
   anything either by reason or by the word of God. The consequence is,
   that, as they are guided by what befalls them, they are continually
   changing their plans. But the Prophet appears to mean somewhat more,
   namely, that when their folly, in having hitherto labored to no
   purpose, shall have been openly manifested and exposed, the Moabites
   will come into the temple of Chemosh, rather through shame than in the
   exercise of judgment.

   13. This is the word. This concluding sentence is the ratification of
   the prophecy. It means that he has pronounced the decree of God
   himself, and that he has brought nothing forward that did not proceed
   from the Lord, and thus, laying aside the person of a man, he
   introduces God speaking in this manner.

   14. Three years. The time is fixed, not only for the sake of certainty,
   but likewise that believers may not become faint through longer delay.
   He alludes to agreements among men, in which it is customary to fix the
   time agreed on, which the parties are not at liberty to transgress.
   This is especially the case in the labors of hirelings, from whom
   Scripture frequently draws a comparison in this respect, that they
   earnestly long for the appointed day when they shall receive their
   reward; for they groan, as it were, under the burden, and grievously
   dislike their daily toils. (Job 7:1, 2, 14:6; Isaiah 21:16.) In this
   way the Lord says, that he fixes a day for the Moabites, in which they
   shall not escape from the entire destruction of their power.

   With all his multitude. He expressly mentions a multitude, because
   their number was great, and because they boasted of it, and thought
   that they were invincible. When he adds, that the remnant shall be
   feeble, he means that there will be so great a change, that they will
   have no resemblance to their former condition; for nothing will be left
   but a sad and shocking sight.

   to read the article Petra in Dr. Eadie's Biblical Cyclopaedia, from
