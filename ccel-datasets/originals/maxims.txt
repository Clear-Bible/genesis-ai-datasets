ARTICLE FIRST.

   Of the love of God, there are various kinds. At least, there are
   various feelings which go under that name.

   First, There is what may be called mercenary or selfish love; that is,
   that love of God which originates in a sole regard to our own
   happiness. Those who love God with no other love than this, love Him
   just as the miser his money, and the voluptuous man his pleasures;
   attaching no value to God, except as a means to an end; and that end is
   the gratification of themselves. Such love, if it can be called by that
   name, is unworthy of God. He does not ask it; He will not receive it.
   In the language of Francis de Sales, "it is sacrilegious and impious."

   Second, Another kind of love does not exclude a regard to our own
   happiness as a motive of love, but requires this motive to be
   subordinate to a much higher one, namely, that of a regard to God's
   glory. It is a mixed state, in which we regard ourselves and God at the
   same time. This love is not necessarily selfish and wrong. On the
   contrary, when the two objects of it, God and ourselves, are relatively
   in the right position, that is to say, when we love God as He ought to
   be loved, and love ourselves no more than we ought to be loved, it is a
   love which, in being properly subordinated, is unselfish and is right.

ARTICLE SECOND.

   I. Of the subjects of this mixed love all are not equally advanced.

   II. Mixed love becomes pure love,when the love of self is relatively,
   though not absolutely, lost in a regard to the will of God. This is
   always the case, when the two objects are loved in their due
   proportion. So that pure love is mixed love when it is combined
   rightly.

   III. Pure love is not inconsistent with mixed love, but is mixed love
   carried to its true result. When this result is attained, the motive of
   God's glory so expands itself, and so fills the mind, that the other
   motive, that of our own happiness, becomes so small, and so recedes
   from our inward notice, as to be practically annihilated. It is then
   that God becomes what He ever ought to be -- the center of the soul, to
   which all its affections tend; the great moral sun of the soul, from
   which all its light and all its warmth proceed. It is then that a man
   thinks no more of himself. He has become the man of a "single eye." His
   own happiness, and all that regards himself, is entirely lost sight of
   in his simple and fixed look to God's will and God's glory.

   IV. We lay ourselves at His feet. Self is known no more; not because it
   is wrong to regard and to desire our own good, but because the object
   of desire is withdrawn from our notice. When the sun shines, the stars
   disappear. When God is in the soul who can think of himself? So that we
   love God, and God alone; and all other things in and for God.

ARTICLE THIRD.

   In the early periods of religious experience, motives, which have a
   regard to our personal happiness, are more prominent and effective than
   at later periods; nor are they to be condemned. It is proper, in
   addressing even religious men, to appeal to the fear of death, to the
   impending judgments of God, to the terrors of hell and the joys of
   heaven. Such appeals are recognized in the Holy Scriptures, and are in
   accordance with the views and feelings of good men in all ages of the
   world. The motives involved in them are powerful aids to beginners in
   religion; assisting, as they do, very much in repressing the passions,
   and in strengthening the practical virtues.

   We should not think lightly, therefore, of the grace of God, as
   manifested in that inferior form of religion which stops short of the
   more glorious and perfected form of pure love. We are to follow God's
   grace, and not to go before it. To the higher state of pure love we are
   to advance step by step; watching carefully God's inward and outward
   providence; and receiving increased grace by improving the grace we
   have, till the dawning light becomes the perfect day.

ARTICLE FOURTH.

   He who is in the state of pure or perfect love, has all the moral and
   Christian virtues in himself. If temperance, forbearance, chastity,
   truth, kindness, forgiveness, justice, may be regarded as virtues,
   there can be no doubt that they are all included in holy love. That is
   to say, the principle of love will not fail to develop itself in each
   of these forms. St. Augustine remarks, that love is the foundation,
   source, or principle of all the virtues. This view is sustained also by
   St. Francis de Sales and by Thomas Aquinas.

   The state of pure love does not exclude the mental state which is
   called Christian hope. Hope in the Christian, when we analyze it into
   its elements, may be described as the desire of being united with God
   in heaven, accompanied with the expectation or belief of being so.

ARTICLE FIFTH.

   Souls that, by being perfected in love, are truly the subjects of
   sanctification, do not cease, nevertheless, to grow in grace. It may
   not be easy to specify and describe the degrees of sanctification ; but
   there seem to be at least two modifications of experience after persons
   have reached this state.

   1. The first may be described as the state of holy resignation. Such a
   soul thinks more frequently than it will, at a subsequent period, of
   its own happiness.

   2. The second state is that of holy indifference. Such a soul
   absolutely ceases either to desire or to will, except in cooperation
   with the Divine leading. Its desires for itself, as it has greater
   light, are more completely and permanently merged in the one higher and
   more absorbing desire of God's glory, and the fulfillment of His will.
   In this state of experience, ceasing to do what we shall be likely to
   do, and what we may very properly do in a lower state, we no longer
   desire our own salvation merely as an eternal deliverance, or merely as
   involving the greatest amount of personal happiness; but we desire it
   chiefly as the fulfillment of God's pleasure, and as resulting in His
   glory, and because He Himself desires and wills that we should thus
   desire and will.

   3. Holy indifference is not inactivity. It is the furthest possible
   from it. It is indifference to anything and everything out of God's
   will; but it is the highest life and activity to anything and
   everything in that will.

ARTICLE SIXTH.

   One of the clearest and best established maxims of ho1iness is, that
   the holy soul, when arrived at the second state mentioned, ceases to
   have desires for anything out of the will of God. The holy soul, when
   it is really in the state called the state of non-desire, may,
   nevertheless, desire everything in relation to the correction of its
   imperfections and weaknesses, its perseverance in its religious state,
   and its ultimate salvation, which it has reason to know from the
   Scriptures, or in any other way, that God desires. It may also desire
   all temporal good, houses and lands, food and clothing, friends and
   books, and exemption from physical suffering, and anything else, so far
   and only so far, as it has reason to think that such desire is
   coincident with the Divine desire. The holy soul not only desires
   particular things, sanctioned by the known will of God; but also the
   fulfillment of His will in all respects, unknown as well as known.
   Being in faith, it commits itself to God in darkness as well as in
   light. Its non-desire is simply its not desiring anything out of God

ARTICLE SEVENTH.

   In the history of inward experience, we not infrequently find accounts
   of individuals whose inward life may properly be characterized as
   extraordinary. They represent themselves as having extraordinary
   communications ;-dreams, visions, revelations. Without stopping to
   inquire whether these inward results arise from an excited and
   disordered state of the physical system or from God, the important
   remark to be made here is, that these things, to whatever extent they
   may exist, do not constitute holiness.

   The principle, which is the life of common Christians in their common
   mixed state, is the principle which originates and sustains the life of
   those who are truly "the pure in heart," namely, the principle of faith
   working by love,--existing, however, in the case of those last
   mentioned, in a greatly increased degree. This is obviously the
   doctrine of John of the Cross, who teaches us, that we must walk in the
   night of faith ; that is to say, with night around us, which exists in
   consequence of our entire ignorance of what is before us, and with
   faith alone, faith in God, in His Word, and in his Providences, for the
   soul's guide.

   Again, the persons who have, or are supposed to have, the visions and
   other remarkable states to which we have referred are sometimes
   disposed to make their own experience, imperfect as it obviously is,
   the guide of their life, considered as separate from and as above the
   written law. Great care should be taken against such an error as this.
   God's word is our true rule.

   Nevertheless, there is no interpreter of the Divine Word like that of a
   holy heart; or, what is the same thing, of the Holy Ghost dwelling in
   the heart. If we give ourselves wholly to God, the Comforter will take
   up His abode with us, and guide us into all that truth which will be
   necessary for us. Truly holy souls, therefore, continually looking to
   God for a proper understanding of His Word, may confidently trust that
   He will guide them aright. A holy soul, in the exercise of its
   legitimate powers of interpretation, may deduce important views from
   the Word of God which would not otherwise be known; but it cannot add
   anything to it.

   Again, God is the regulator of the affections, as well as of the
   outward actions. Sometimes the state which He inspires within us is
   that of holy love ;-sometimes He inspires affections which have love
   and faith for their basis, but have a specific character, and then
   appear under other names, such as humility, forgiveness, gratitude. But
   in all cases there is nothing holy, except what is based upon the
   antecedent or "prevenient" grace of God. In all the universe, there is
   but one legitimate Originator. Man's business is that of concurrence.
   And this view is applicable to all the stages of Christian experience,
   from the lowest to the highest.

ARTICLE EIGHTH.

   Writers often speak of abandonment. The term has a meaning somewhat
   specific. The soul in this state does not renounce everything, and thus
   become brutish in its indifference; but renounces everything except
   God's will.

   Souls in the state of abandonment, not only forsake outward things,
   but, what is still more important, forsake themselves.

   Abandonment, or self-renunciation, is not the renunciation of faith or
   of love or of anything else, except selfishness.

   The state of abandonment, or entire self-renunciation, is generally
   attended, and perhaps we may say, carried out and perfected, by
   temptations more or less severe. We cannot well know, whether we have
   renounced ourselves, except by being tried on those very points to
   which our self-renunciation, either real or supposed, relates. One of
   the severest inward trials is that by which we are taken off from all
   inward sensible supports, and are made to live and walk by faith alone.
   Pious and holy men who have been the subjects of inward crucifixion,
   often refer to the trials which have been experienced by them. They
   sometimes speak of them as a sort of inward and terrible purgatory.
   "Only mad and wicked men," says Cardinal Bona, "will deny the existence
   of these remarkable experiences, attested as they are by men of the
   most venerable virtue, who speak only of what they have known in
   themselves."

   Trials are not always of the same duration. The more cheerfully and
   faithfully we give ourselves to God, to be smitten in any and all of
   our idols, whenever and wherever He chooses, the shorter will be the
   work. God makes us to suffer no longer than He sees to be necessary for
   us.

   We should not be premature in concluding that inward crucifixion is
   complete, and our abandonment to God is without any reservation
   whatever. The act of consecration, which is a sort of incipient step,
   may be sincere; but the reality of the consecration can be known only
   when God has applied the appropriate tests. The trial will show whether
   we are wholly the Lord's. Those who prematurely draw the conclusion
   that they are so, expose themselves to great illusion and injury.

ARTICLE NINTH.

   The state of abandonment, or of entire self-renunciation, does not take
   from the soul that moral power which is essential to its moral agency;
   nor that antecedent or prevenient grace, without which even abandonment
   itself would be a state of moral death; nor the principle of faith,
   which prevenient grace originated, and through which it now operates;
   nor the desire and hope of final salvation, although it takes away all
   uneasiness and unbelief connected with such a desire; nor the fountains
   of love which spring up deeply and freshly within it; nor the hatred of
   sin; nor the testimony of a good conscience.

   But it takes away that uneasy hankering of the soul after pleasure
   either inward or outward, and the selfish vivacity and eagerness of
   nature, which is too impatient to wait calmly and submissively for
   God's time of action. By fixing the mind wholly upon God, it takes away
   the disposition of the soul to occupy itself with reflex acts; that is,
   with the undue examination and analysis of its own feelings. It does
   not take away the pain and sorrow naturally incident to our physical
   state and natural sensibilities; but it takes away all uneasiness, all
   murmuring ;-leaving the soul in its inner nature, and in every part of
   its nature where the power of faith reaches, calm and peaceable as the
   God that dwells there.

ARTICLE TENTH.

   God has promised life and happiness to His people. What He has promised
   can never fail to take place. Nevertheless, it is the disposition of
   those who love God with a perfect heart, to leave themselves entirely
   in His hands, irrespective, in some degree, of the promise. By the aid
   of the promise, without which they must have remained in their original
   weakness, they rise, as it were, above the promise; and rest in that
   essential and eternal will, in which the promise originated.

   So much is this the case, that some individuals, across whose path God
   had spread the darkness of His providences, and who seemed to
   themselves for a time to be thrown out of His favor and to be
   hopelessly lost, have acquiesced with submission in the terrible
   destiny which was thus presented before them. Such was the state of
   mind of Francis de Sales, as he prostrated himself in the church of St.
   Stephen des Grez. The language of such persons, uttered without
   complaint, is, " My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" They claim
   God as their God, and will not abandon their love to Him, although they
   believe, at the time, that they are forsaken of Him. They choose to
   leave themselves, under all possible circumstances, entirely in the
   hands of God: their language is, even if it should be His pleasure to
   separate them for ever from the enjoyments of His presence, Not my
   will, but thine be done."

   It is perhaps difficult to perceive, how minds whose life, as it were,
   is the principle of faith, can be in this situation. Take the case of
   the Saviour. It is certainly difficult to conceive how the Saviour,
   whose faith never failed, could yet believe Himself forsaken; and yet
   it was so.

   We know that it is impossible for God to forsake those who put their
   trust in Him. He can just as soon forsake His own word; and, what is
   more, He can just as soon forsake His own nature. Holy souls,
   nevertheless, may sometimes, in a way and under circumstances which we
   may not fully understand, believe themselves to be forsaken, beyond all
   possibility of hope; and yet such is their faith in God and their love
   to Him, that the will of God, even under such circumstances, is dearer
   to them than anything and everything else.

ARTICLE ELEVENTH.

   One great point of difference between the First Covenant, or the
   covenant of works, which said to men, " Do this and live," and the
   Second Covenant, or the covenant of grace, which says, Believe and
   live," is this :-The first covenant did not lead men to anything that
   was perfect. It showed men what was right and good; but it failed in
   giving them the power to fulfill what the covenant required. Men not
   only understood what was right and good, but they knew what was evil;
   but, in their love and practice of depravity, they had no longer power
   of themselves to flee from it.

   The new or Christian covenant of grace, not only prescribes and
   commands, but gives also the power to fulfill.

   In the practical dispensations of divine grace, there are number of
   principles which it may be important to remember.

   1. God being LOVE, it is a part of His nature to desire to communicate
   Himself to all moral beings, and to make Himself one with them in a
   perfect harmony of relations and feelings. The position of God is that
   of giver; the position of man is that of recipient. harmonized with man
   by the blood and power of the Cross, he has once more become the
   infinite fullness, the original and overflowing fountain, giving and
   ever ready to give.

   2. Such are the relations between God and man, involved in the fact of
   man's moral agency, that man's business is to receive.

   3. Souls true to the grace given them, will never suffer any diminution
   of it. On the contrary, the great and unchangeable condition of
   continuance and of growth in grace is cooperation with what we now
   have. This is the law of growth, not only deducible from the Divine
   nature, but expressly revealed and declared in the Scriptures :-" For
   whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more
   abundance; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even
   that he hath."-Matt. xiii. 12.

   A faithful cooperation with grace, is the most effectual preparation
   for attracting and receiving and increasing grace. This is the great
   secret of advancement to those high degrees which are permitted;
   namely, a strict, unwavering, faithful cooperation, moment by moment.

   4. It is important correctly to understand the doctrine of cooperation.
   A disposition to cooperate, is not more opposed to the sinful indolence
   which falls behind, than to the hasty and unrighteous zeal which runs
   before. It is in the excess of zeal, which has a good appearance, but
   in reality has unbelief and self at the bottom, that we run before God.

   5. Cooperation, by being calm and peaceable, does not cease to be
   efficacious. Souls in this purified but tranquil state are souls of
   power; watchful and triumphant against self; resisting temptation;
   fighting even to blood against sin. But it is, nevertheless, a combat
   free from the turbulence and inconsistencies of human passion; because
   they contend in the presence of God, who is their strength, in the
   spirit of the highest faith and love, and under the guidance of the
   Holy Ghost, who is always tranquil in His operations.

ARTICLE TWELFTH.

   Those in the highest state of religions experience desire nothing,
   except that God may be glorified in them by the accomplishment of His
   holy will. Nor is it inconsistent with this, that holy souls possess
   that natural love which exists in the form of love for themselves.
   Their natural love, however, which, within its proper degree, is
   innocent love, is so absorbed in the love of God, that it ceases, for
   the most part, to be a distinct object of consciousness; and
   practically and truly they may be said to love themselves IN and FOR
   God. Adam, in his state of innocence, loved himself, considered as the
   reflex image of God and for God's sake. So that we may either say, that
   he loved God in himself, or that he loved himself IN and FOR God. And
   it is because holy souls, extending their affections beyond their own
   limit, love their neighbor on the same principle of loving, namely, IN
   and FOR God, that they may be said to love their neighbors as
   themselves.

   It does not follow, because the love of ourselves is lost in the love
   of God, that we are to take no care, and to exercise no watch over
   ourselves. No man will be so seriously and constantly watchful over
   himself as he who loves himself IN and FOR God alone. Having the image
   of God in himself, he has a motive strong, we might perhaps say, as
   that which controls the actions of angels, to guard and protect it.

   It may be thought, perhaps, that this is inconsistent with the
   principle in the doctrines of holy living, which requires in the
   highest stages of inward experience, to avoid those reflex acts which
   consist in self-inspection, because such acts have a tendency to turn
   the mind off from God. The apparent difficulty is reconciled in this
   way. The holy soul is a soul with God; moving as God moves; doing as
   God does; looking as God looks. If, therefore, God is looking within
   us, as we may generally learn from the intimations of His providences,
   then it is a sign that we are to look within ourselves. Our little eye,
   our small and almost imperceptible ray, must look in, in the midst of
   the light of His great and burning eye. It is thus that we may inspect
   ourselves without a separation from God.

   On the same principle, we may be watchful and careful over our
   neighbors; watching them, not in our own time, but in God's time; not
   in the censoriousness of nature, but in the kindness and forbearance of
   grace; not as separate from God, but in concurrence with Him.

ARTICLE THIRTEENTH.

   The soul, in the state of pure love, acts in simplicity. Its inward
   rule of action is found in the decisions of a sanctified conscience.
   These decisions, based upon judgments that are free from self-interest,
   may not always be absolutely right, because our views and judgments,
   being limited, can extend only to things in part; but they may be said
   to be relatively right: they conform to things so far as we are
   permitted to see them and understand them, and convey to the soul a
   moral assurance, that, when we act in accordance with them, we are
   doing as God would have us do. Such a conscience is enlightened by the
   Spirit of God; and when we act thus, under its Divine guidance, looking
   at what now is and not at what may be, looking at the right of things
   and not at their relations to our personal and selfish interests, we
   are said to act in simplicity. This is the true mode of action.

   Thus, in this singleness of spirit, we do things, as some experimental
   writers express it, without knowing what we do. We are so absorbed in
   the thing to be done, and in the importance of doing it rightly, that
   we forget ourselves. Perfect love has nothing to spare from its object
   for itself, and he who prays perfectly is never thinking how well he
   prays.

ARTICLE FOURTEENTH.

   Holy souls are without impatience, but not without trouble; are above
   murmuring, but not above affliction. The souls of those who are thus
   wholly in Christ may be regarded in two points of view, or rather in
   two parts; namely, the natural appetites, propensities, and affections,
   on the one hand, which may be called the inferior part; and the
   judgment, the moral sense, and the will, on the other, which may be
   described as the superior part. As things are, in the present life,
   those who are wholly devoted to God may suffer in the inferior part,
   and may be at rest in the superior. Their wills may be in harmony with
   the Divine will; they may be approved in their judgments and
   conscience, and at the same time may suffer greatly in their physical
   relations, and in their natural sensibilities. In this manner, Christ
   upon the cross, while His will remained firm in its union with the will
   of His heavenly Father, suffered much through His physical system; He
   felt the painful longings of thirst, the pressure of the thorns, and
   the agony of the spear. He was deeply afflicted also for the friends He
   left behind Him, and for a dying world. But in His inner and higher
   nature, where He felt Himself sustained by the secret voice uttered in
   His sanctified conscience and in His unchangeable faith, He was
   peaceful and happy.

ARTICLE FIFTEENTH.

   A suitable repression of the natural appetites is profitable and
   necessary. We are told that the body should be brought into subjection.
   Those physical mortifications, therefore, which are instituted to this
   end, denominated austerities, are not to be disapproved. When practiced
   within proper limits, they tend to correct evil habits, to preserve us
   against temptation, and to give self-control.

   The practice of austerities, with the views and on the principles
   indicated, should be accompanied with the spirit of recollection, of
   love, and prayer. Christ himself, whose retirement to solitary places,
   whose prayers and fastings are not to be forgotten, has given us the
   pattern which it is proper for us to follow. We must sometimes use
   force against our stubborn nature. "Since the days of John, the kingdom
   of heaven suffers violence; and the violent take it by force."

ARTICLE SIXTEENTH.

   The simple desire of our own happiness, kept in due subordination, is
   innocent. This desire is natural to us; and is properly denominated the
   principle of SELF-LOVE. When the principle of self-love passes its
   appropriate limit, it becomes selfishness. Self-love is innocent;
   selfishness is wrong. Selfishness was the sin of the first angel, "who
   rested in himself," as St. Augustine expresses it, instead of referring
   himself to God.

   In many Christians a prominent principle of action is the desire of
   happiness. They love God and they love heaven; they love holiness, and
   they love the pleasures of holiness; they love to do good, and they
   love the rewards of doing good. This is well; but there is something
   better. Such Christians are inferior to those who forget the
   nothingness of the creature in the infinitude of the Creator, and love
   God for His own glory alone.

ARTICLE SEVENTEENTH.

   No period of the Christian life is exempt from temptation. The
   temptations incident to the earlier stages are different from those
   incident to a later period, and are to be resisted in a different
   manner.

   Sometimes the temptations incident to the transition-state from mixed
   love to pure love are somewhat peculiar, being adapted to test whether
   we love God for Himself alone.

   In the lower or mixed state the methods of resisting temptations are
   various. Sometimes the subject of these trials boldly faces them, and
   endeavors to overcome them by a direct resistance. Sometimes he turns
   and flees. But in the state of pure love, when the soul has become
   strong in the Divine contemplation, it is the common rule laid down by
   religious writers, that the soul should keep itself fixed upon God in
   the exercise of its holy love as at other times, as the most effectual
   way of resisting the temptation, which would naturally expand its
   efforts in vain upon a soul in that state.

ARTICLE EIGHTEENTH.

   The will of God is the ultimate and only rule of action. God manifests
   His will in various ways. The will of God may in some cases be
   ascertained by the operations of the human mind, especially when under
   a religious or gracious guidance. But He reveals His will chiefly in
   His written word. And nothing can be declared to be the will of God,
   which is at variance with His written or revealed will, which may also
   be called His positive will.

   If we sin, it is that that God permits it; but it is also true, that He
   disapproves and condemns it as contrary to His immutable holiness.

   It is the business of the sinner to repent. The state of penitence has
   temptations peculiar to itself. He is sometimes tempted to murmuring
   and rebellious feelings, as if he had been unjustly left of God. When
   penitence is true, and in the highest state, it is free from the
   variations of human passion.

ARTICLE NINETEENTH.

   Among other distinctions of prayer, we may make that of vocal and
   silent, the prayer of the lips and the prayer of the affections. Vocal
   prayer, without the heart attending it, is superstitious and wholly
   unprofitable. To pray without recollection in God and without love, is
   to pray as the heathen did, who thought to be heard for the multitude
   of their words.

   Nevertheless, vocal prayer, when attended by right affections, ought to
   be both recognized and encouraged, as being calculated to strengthen
   the thoughts and feelings it expresses, and to awaken new ones, and
   also for the reason that it was taught by the Son of God to His
   Apostles, and that it has been practiced by the whole Church in all
   ages. To make light of this sacrifice of praise, this fruit of the
   lips, would be an impiety.

   Silent prayer, in its common form, is also profitable. Each has its
   peculiar advantages, as each has its place.

   There is also a modification of prayer, which may be termed the prayer
   of silence. This is a prayer too deep for words. The common form of
   silent prayer is voluntary. In the prayer of contemplative silence, the
   lips seem to be closed almost against the will.

ARTICLE TWENTIETH.

   The principles of holy living extend to everything. For instance, in
   the matter of reading, he who has given himself wholly to God, can read
   only what God permits him to read. He cannot read books, however
   characterized by wit or power, merely to indulge an idle curiosity, or
   to please himself alone.

   In reading this may be a suitable direction, namely, to read but little
   at a time, and to interrupt the reading by intervals of religious
   recollection, in order that we may let the Holy Spirit more deeply
   imprint in us Christian truths.

   God, in the person of the Holy Ghost, becomes to the fully renovated
   mind the great inward Teacher. This is a great truth. At the same time
   we are not to suppose that the presence of the inward teacher exempts
   us from the necessity of the outward lesson. The Holy Ghost, operating
   through the medium of a purified judgment, teaches us by the means of
   books, especially by the word of God, which is never to be laid aside.
     __________________________________________________________________

ARTICLE TWENTY-FIRST.

   One characteristic of the lower states of religious experience is, that
   they are sustained, in a considerable degree, by meditative and
   reflective acts. As faith is comparatively weak and temptations are
   strong, it becomes necessary to gain strength by such meditative and
   reflective acts, by the consideration of various truths applicable to
   their situation, and of the motives drawn from such truths.
   Accordingly, souls array before them all the various motives drawn from
   the consideration of misery on the one hand, and of happiness on the
   other; all the motives of fear and hope.

   It is different with those who have given themselves wholly to God in
   the exercise of pure or perfect love. The soul does not find it
   necessary to delay and to meditate, in order to discover motives of
   action. It finds its motive of action a motive simple, uniform,
   peaceable, and still powerful beyond any other power, in its own
   principle of life.

   Meditation, inquiry, and reasoning, are exceedingly necessary to the
   great body of Christians; and absolutely indispensable to those in the
   beginnings of the Christian life. To take away these helps would be to
   take away the child from the breast before it can digest solid food.
   Still they are only the props, and not the life itself.

ARTICLE TWENTY-SECOND.

   The holy soul delights in acts of contemplation; to think of God and of
   God only. But the contemplative state, without any interruption, is
   hardly consistent with the condition of the present life. It may be
   permitted to exist, however, and ought not to be resisted, when the
   attraction towards God is so strong, that we find ourselves incapable
   of profitably employing our minds in meditative and discursive acts.

ARTICLE TWENTY-THIRD.

   Of the two states, the meditative and discursive on the one hand, which
   reflects, compares, and reasons, and supports itself by aids and
   methods of that nature, and the contemplative on the other, which rests
   in God without such aids, the contemplative is the higher. God will
   teach the times of both. Neither state is, or ought to be, entirely
   exclusive of the other.

ARTICLE TWENTY-FOURTH.

   In some cases God gives such eminent grace, that the contemplative
   prayer, which is essentially the same with the prayer of silence,
   becomes the habitual state. We do not mean, that the mind is always in
   this state; but that, whenever the season of recollection and prayer
   returns, it habitually assumes the contemplative state, in distinction
   from the meditative and discursive.

   It does not follow that this state, eminent as it is, is invariable.
   Souls may fall from this state by some act of infidelity in themselves;
   or God may place them temporarily in a different state.

ARTICLE TWENTY-FIFTH.

   " Whether, therefore," says the Apostle, "you eat or drink, or
   whatsoever you do, do all things to the glory of God," 1 Cor. X.31. And
   in another passage he says, " Let all things be done with charity,"
   1Cor. XVI. 14. And again, "By love serve one another," Gal. V.13: -
   passages which, with many others, imply two things; first, that
   everything which is done by the Christian ought to be done from a holy
   principle ; and, second, that this principle is love.

ARTICLE TWENTY SIXTH.

   Our acceptance with God, when our hearts are wholly given to Him, does
   not depend upon our being in a particular state, but simply upon our
   being in that state in which God in His providence requires us to be.
   The doctrine of holiness, therefore, while it recognizes and requires,
   on its appropriate occasions, the prayer of contemplation or of
   contemplative silence, is not only not inconsistent with other forms of
   prayer, but is not at all inconsistent with the practice of the
   ordinary acts, duties, and virtues of life. It would be a great mistake
   to suppose, that a man who bears the Saviour's image, is any the less
   on that account a good neighbor or a good citizen; that he can think
   less or work less when he is called to it; or that he is not
   characterized by the various virtues, appropriate to our present
   situation, of temperance, truth, forbearance, forgiveness, kindness,
   chastity, justice. There is a law, involved in the very nature of
   holiness, which requires it to adapt itself to every variety of
   situation.

ARTICLE TWENTY-SEVENTH.

   It is in accordance with the views of Dionysius the Areopagite, to say,
   that the holy soul in its contemplative state, is occupied with the
   pure or spiritual Divinity. That is to say, it is occupied with God, in
   distinction from any mere image of God, such as could be addressed to
   the touch, the sight, or any of the senses.

   And this is not all. It does not satisfy the desires of the soul in its
   contemplative state, to occupy itself merely with the attributes of
   God; with His power, wisdom, goodness, and the like; but it rather
   seeks and unites itself with the God of the attributes. The attributes
   of God are not God himself. The power of God is not an identical
   expression with the God of power; nor is the wisdom of God identical
   with the God of wisdom. The holy soul, in its contemplative state,
   loves to unite itself with God, considered as the subject of His
   attributes. It is not infinite wisdom, infinite power, or infinite
   goodness, considered separately from the existence of whom they can be
   predicated, which it loves and adores; but the God of infinite wisdom,
   power, and goodness.

ARTICLE TWENTY- EIGHTH.

   Christ is " the way, and the truth, and the life." The grace which
   sanctifies as well as that which justifies, is by Him and through Him.
   He is the true and living way; and no man can gain the victory over
   sin, and be brought into union with God, without Christ. And when, in
   some mitigated sense, we may be said to have arrived at the end of the
   way by being brought home to the Divine fold and reinstated in the
   Divine image, it would be sad indeed if we should forget the way
   itself, as Christ is sometimes called. At every period of our progress,
   however advanced it may be, our life is derived from God through Him
   and for Him. The most advanced souls are those which are most possessed
   with the thoughts and the presence of Christ.

   Any other view would be extremely pernicious. It would be to snatch
   from the faithful eternal life, which consists in knowing the only true
   God and Jesus Christ His Son, whom he has sent.

ARTICLE TWENTY-NINTH.

   The way of holiness is wonderful, but it is not miraculous. Those in
   it, walk by simple faith alone. And perhaps there is nothing more
   remarkable nor wonderful in it, than that a result so great should be
   produced by a principle so simple.

   When persons have arrived at the state of divine union, sothat, in
   accordance with the prayer of the Saviour, they are made one with
   Christ in God, they no longer seem to put forth distinct inward acts,
   but their state appears to be characterized by a deep and Divine
   repose.

   The continuous act is the act of faith, which brings into moral and
   religious union with the Divine nature; faith which, through the
   plenitude of Divine grace, is kept firm, unbroken.

   The appearance of absolute continuity and unity in this blessed state
   is increased perhaps by the entire freedom of the mind from all eager,
   anxious, unquiet acts. The soul is not only at unity with itself in the
   respects which have been mentioned, but it has also a unity of rest.

   This state of continuous faith and of consequent repose in God is
   sometimes denominated the passive state. The soul, at such times,
   ceases to originate acts which precede the grace of God. The decisions
   of her consecrated judgment, are the voice of the Holy Ghost in the
   soul. But if she first listens passively, it is subsequently her
   business to yield an active and effective cooperation in the line of
   duty which they indicate. The more pliant and supple the soul is to the
   Divine suggestions, the more real and efficacious is her own action,
   though without any excited and troubled movement. The more a soul
   receives from God, the more she ought to restore to Him of what she has
   from Him. This ebbing and flowing, if one may so express it, this
   communication on the part of God and the correspondent action on the
   part of man, constitute the order of grace on the one hand, and the
   action and fidelity of the creature on the other.

ARTICLE THIRTIETH.

   It would be a mistake to suppose, that the highest state of inward
   experience is characterized by great excitements, by raptures and
   ecstasies, or by any movements of feeling which would be regarded as
   particularly extraordinary.

   One of the remarkable results in a soul of which faith is the sole
   governing principle, is, that it is entirely peaceful. Nothing disturbs
   it. And being thus peaceful, it reflects distinctly and clearly the
   image of Christ; like the placid lake, which shows, in its own clear
   and beautiful bosom, the exact forms of the objects around and above
   it. Another is, that having full faith in God and divested of all
   selfishness and resistance in itself, it is perfectly accessible and
   pliable to all the impressions of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

ARTICLE THIRTY-FIRST.

   It does not follow, that those who possess the graces of a truly
   sanctified heart, are at liberty to reject the ordinary methods and
   rules of perception and judgment. They exercise and value wisdom, while
   they reject the selfishness of wisdom. The rules of holy living would
   require them every moment to make a faithful use of all the natural
   light of reason, as well as the higher and spiritual light of grace.

   A holy soul values and seeks wisdom, but does not seek it in anunholy
   and worldly spirit. Nor, when it is made wise by the Spirit of wisdom,
   who dwells in all hearts that are wholly devoted to God, does it turn
   back from the giver to the gift, and rejoice in its wisdom as its own.

   The wisdom of the truly holy soul is a wisdom which estimates things in
   the present moment. It judges of duty from the facts which now are;
   including, however, those things which have a relation to the present.
   It is an important remark, that the present moment necessarily
   possesses a moral extension; so that, in judging of it, we are to
   include all those things which have a natural and near relation to the
   thing actually in hand. It is inthis manner that the holy soul lives in
   the present, committing the past to God, and leaving the future with
   that approaching hour which shall convert it into the present.
   "Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof." To-morrow will take care
   of itself; it will bring, at its coming, its appropriate grace and
   light. When we live thus, God will not fail to give us our daily bread.

   Such souls draw on themselves the special protection of Providence,
   under whose care they live, without a far extended and unquiet
   forecast, like little children resting in the bosom of their mother.
   Conscious of their own limited views, and keeping in000mind the
   direction of the Saviour, Judge not that you be not judged, they are
   slow to pass judgment upon others. They are willing to receive reproof
   and correction; and, separate from the will of God, they have no choice
   or will of their own in anything.

   These are the children whom Christ permits to come near Him. They
   combine the prudence of the serpent with the simplicity of the dove.
   But they do not appropriate their prudence to themselves as their own
   prudence, any more than they appropriate to themselves the beams of the
   natural sun, when they walk in its light.

   These are the poor in spirit, whom Christ Jesus hath declared blessed;
   and who are as much taken off from any complacency in what others might
   call their merits, as all Christians ought to be from their temporal
   possessions. They are the "little ones," to whom God is well pleased to
   reveal His mysteries, while He hides them from the wise and prudent.

ARTICLE THIRTY-SECOND.

   The children, in distinction from the mere servants of God, have the
   liberty of children. They have a peace and joy, full of innocency. They
   take with simplicity and without hesitation the refreshments both of
   mind and body. They do not speak of themselves, except when called to
   do it in providence, and in order to do good. And such is their
   simplicity and truth of spirit, they speak of things just as they
   appear to them at the moment; and when the conversation turns upon
   their own works, or characters, they express themselves favorably or
   unfavorably, much as they would if they were speaking of others. If;
   however, they have occasion to speak of any good of which they have
   been the instrument, they always acknowledge, with humble joy, that it
   comes from God alone.

   There is a liberty, which might more properly be called license. There
   are persons who maintain that purity of heart renders pure, in the
   subjects of this purity, whatever they are prompted to do, however
   irregular it may be in others. This is a great error.

ARTICLE THIRTY-THIRD.

   It is the doctrine of Augustine, as also of Thomas Aquinas, that the
   principle of holy love existing in the heart, necessarily includes in
   itself; or implies the existence, of all other Christian virtues. He
   who loves God with all his heart, will not violate the laws of purity,
   because it would be a disregard of the will of God, which he loves
   above all things. His love, under such circumstances, becomes the
   virtue of chastity. He has too much love and reverence for the will of
   God to murmur or repine under the dispensations of His providence. His
   love, under such circumstances, becomes the virtue of patience. And
   thus this love becomes by turns, on their appropriate occasions, all
   the virtues. As his love is perfect, so the virtues which flow out of
   it, and are modified from it, will not be less so.

   It is a maxim in the doctrines of holiness, that the holy soul is
   crucified to its own virtues, although it possesses them in the highest
   degree. The meaning of this saying is this: The holy soul is so
   crucified to self in all its forms, that it practices the virtues
   without taking complacency in its virtues as it, own, and even without
   thinking how virtuous it is.

ARTICLE THIRTY-FORTH.

   The Apostle Paul speaks of Christians as dead. " You are dead," he
   says, "and your life is hid with Christ in God." (Col. iii. 3. These
   expressions will apply, in their full import, only to those Christians
   who are in the state of unselfish or pure love. Their death is a death
   to selfishness. They are dead to pride and jealousy, self-seeking and
   envy, to malice, inordinate love of their own reputation, anything and
   every-thing which constitutes the fallen and vitiated life of nature.
   They have a new life, which is "hid with Christ in God."

ARTICLE THIRTY-FIFTH.

   Some persons of great piety, in describing the highest religious state,
   have denominated it the state of transformation. But this can be
   regarded as only a synonymous expression for the state of pure love.

   In the transformed state of the soul, as in the state of pure love,
   love is its life. In this principle of love all the affections ofthe
   soul, of whatever character, have their constituting or their
   controlling element. There can be no love without an object of love. As
   the principle of love, therefore, allies the soul with another, so from
   that other which is God, all its power of movement proceeds. In itself
   it remains without preference for anything; and consequently is
   accessible and pliant to all the touches and guidances of grace,
   however slight they may be. It is like a spherical body, placed upon a
   level and even surface, which is moved with equal ease in any
   direction. The soul in this state, having no preferences of itself, has
   but one principle of movement, namely, that which God gives it. In this
   state the soul can say with the Apostle Paul, "I live; Yet not I, but
   Christ lives in me."

ARTICLE THIRTY-SIXTH.

   Souls which have experienced the grace of sanctification in its higher
   degrees, have not so much need of set times arid places for worship as
   others. Such is the purity and the strength of their love, that it is
   very easy for them to unite with God in acts of inward worship, at all
   times and places. They have an interior closet. The soul is their
   temple, and God dwells in it.

   This, however, does not exempt them from those outward methods and
   observances which God has prescribed. Besides, they owe something to
   others; and a disregard to the ordinances and ministrations of the
   Church could not fail to be injurious to beginners in the religions
   life.

ARTICLE THIRTY-SEVENTH.

   The practice of confession is not inconsistent with the state of pure
   love. The truly renovated soul can still say, Forgive us our
   trespasses. If it does not sin now, deliberately and knowingly, still
   its former state of sin can never be forgotten.

ARTICLE THIRTY-EIGHTH.

   In the transformed state, or state of pure love, there should be not
   only the confession of sins, properly so called, but also the
   confession of those more venial transgressions, termed faults. We
   should sincerely disapprove such faults in our confession; should
   condemn them and desire their remission; and not merely with a view to
   our own cleansing and deliverance, but also because God wills it, and
   because He would have us to do it for His glory.

ARTICLE THIRTY-NINTH.

   It is sometimes the case, that persons misjudge of the holiness of
   individuals, by estimating it from the incidents of the outward
   appearance. Holiness is consistent with the existence, in the same
   person, of various infirmities; (such as an unprepossessing form,
   physical weakness, a debilitated judgment, an imperfect mode of
   expression, defective manners, a want of knowledge, and the like.)

ARTICLE FORTIETH.

   The holy soul may be said to be united with God, without anything
   intervening or producing a separation, in three particulars.

   First. -It is thus united intellectually ;-that is to say, not by any
   idea which is based upon the senses, and which of course could give
   only a material image of God, but by an idea which is internal and
   spiritual in its origin, and makes God known to us as a Being without
   form.

   Second. -The soul is thus united to God, if we may so express it,
   affectionately. That is to say, when its affections are given to God,
   not indirectly through a self-interested motive, but simply because He
   is what He is. The soul is united to God in love without anything
   intervening, when it loves Him for His own sake.

   Third. -The soul is thus united to God practically;-and this is the
   case when it does the will of God, not by simply following a prescribed
   form, but from the constantly operative impulse of holy love.
     __________________________________________________________________

ARTICLE FORTY-FIRST.

   We find in some devout writers on inward experience, the phrase
   spiritual nuptials. It is a favorite method with some of these writers,
   to represent the union of the soul with God by the figure of the bride
   and the bridegroom. Similar expressions are found in the Scriptures.

   We are not to suppose that such expressions mean anything more, in
   reality, than that intimate union which exists between God and the
   soul, when the soul is in the state of pure love.

ARTICLE FORTY-SECOND.

   We find again other forms of expression, which it is proper to notice.
   The union between God and the soul is sometimes described by them as an
   "essential" union, and sometimes as a "substantial" union, as if there
   were a union of essence, substance, or being, in the literal or
   physical sense. They mean to express nothing more than the fact of the
   union of pure love, with the additional idea that the union is firm and
   established; not subject to those breaks and inequalities, to that want
   of continuity and uniformity of love which characterize inferior
   degrees of experience.

ARTICLE FORTY-THIRD.

   It is the holy soul of which St. Paul may be understood especially to
   speak, where he says, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they
   are the sons of God." (Rom. viii. 14.)

   Those who are in a state of simple faith, which can always be said of
   those who are in the state of pure love, are the "little ones" of the
   Scriptures, of whom we are told that God teaches them. "I thank you,
   says the Saviour, "O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have
   hid these things from the wise and prudent, and has revealed them to
   babes." (Luke x. 21.) Such souls, taught as they are by the Spirit of
   God which dwells in them, possess a knowledge which the wisdom of the
   world could never impart. But such knowledge never renders them
   otherwise than respectful to religious teachers, docile to the
   instructions of the Church, and conformable in all things to the
   precepts of the Scriptures.

ARTICLE FORTY-FOURTH.

   The doctrine of pure love has been known and recognized as a true
   doctrine among the truly contemplative and devout in all ages of the
   Church. The doctrine, however, has been so far above the common
   experience, that the pastors and saints of all ages have exercised a
   degree of discretion and care in making it known, except to those to
   whom God had already given both the attraction and light to receive it.
   Acting on the principle of giving milk to infants and strong meat to
   those that were more advanced, they addressed in the great body of
   Christians the motives of fear and of hope, founded on the
   consideration of happiness or of misery. It seemed to them, that the
   motive of God's glory, in itself considered, a motive which requires us
   to love God for Himself alone without a distinct regard and reference
   to our own happiness, could he profitably addressed, as a general rule,
   only to those who are somewhat advanced in inward experience.

ARTICLE FORTY-FIFTH.

   Among the various forms of expression indicative of the highest
   experience, we sometimes find that of "Divine union," or "union with
   God."

   Union with God, not a physical but moral or religious union,
   necessarily exists in souls that are in the state of pure love. The
   state of "Divine union " is not a higher state than that of pure love,
   but may rather be described as the same state.

   Strive after it; but do not too readily or easily believe that you have
   attained to it. The traveler, after many fatigues and dangers, arrives
   at the top of a mountain. As he looks abroad from that high eminence,
   and in that clear atmosphere, he sees his native city; and it seems to
   him to be very near. Overjoyed at the sight, and perhaps deceived by
   his position, he proclaims himself as already at the end of his
   journey. But he soon finds that the distance was greater than he
   supposed. He is obliged to descend into valleys, and to climb over
   hills, and to surmount rugged rocks, and to wind his tired steps over
   many a mile of weary way, before he reaches that home and city, which
   he once thought so near.

   It is thus in relation to the sanctification of the heart. True
   holiness of heart is the object at which the Christian aims. He beholds
   it before him, as an object of transcendent beauty, and as perhaps near
   at hand. But as he advances towards it, he finds the way longer and
   more difficult than he had imagined. But if on the one hand we should
   be careful not to mistake au intermediate stopping place for the end of
   the way, we should be equally careful on the other not to be
   discouraged by the difficulties we meet with; remembering that the
   obligation to be holy is always binding upon us, and that God will help
   those who put their trust in Him.

   "Whatsoever is born of God, overcomes the world; and this is the
   victory that overcomes the world, EVEN OUR FAITH." (1 John v.4.)

   Note by T.C. Upham: In the preceding view I have omitted a number of
   passages which were exclusively Roman Catholic in their aspect, in
   being of less interest and value to the Protestant reader than other
   parts.
